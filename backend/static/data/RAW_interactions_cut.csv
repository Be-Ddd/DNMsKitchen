596506,38,2008-02-13,5,"Yummy, yummy, yummy! I am a big fan of fruit and yogurt together, and this was a very good mix!",,
1060485,38,2009-01-15,4,very good!! the directions were alittle weird though...,,
1802956262,38,2014-07-22,4,This does taste great! I think the recipe needs a bit less berries and a little bit more yogurt though. The result is still very berry!,,
2123645,38,2014-08-14,4,"Tasty and refreshing! I love the creamy flavor the vanilla yogurt adds. I didn&#039;t put mine in a mold, but instead just served it up like ice cream.",,
393254,39,2007-01-20,3,"I have an Indian friend who made this dish for my family.  This recipe tastes almost like it, but I think some of the proportions for the spices is off.  I definitely think it calls for too much saffron (my rice was too yellow).  I think it should be just a pinch.  I will definitely try it again, but will probably tweak it!",,
59064,40,2002-12-18,5,"My favourite lemonade recipe is essentially the same as this. Allowing the sugar to absorb the lemon oils is what makes it so delicious. The syrup is quite concentrated so a little goes a long way. I usually use the zest of 4 lemons, their juice and 1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup sugar. It's good old fashioned lemonade. Use mineral water to dilute the syrup and you get a great fizzy drink.",,
70154,40,2003-02-01,1,complicated recipe but cool.,,
39949,40,2003-08-13,4,"The taste was excellent, and it really wasn't difficult to make at all.  My stepdaughter and I did this one afternoon, and everything turned out great; the only change we made was to add more hot water to dissolve the sugar; the amount called for was not quite enough.  Very good taste, especially with the lemon zest.  Excellent recipe we'll use often.",,
132353,40,2004-06-02,5,I made this with limes instead of lemosn and it was the best limeade i've ever had! sooo good!,,
172249,40,2004-11-10,4,Really nice lemonade. Used a potato peeler to get the zest off.  No white comes off if you do it in a light pressure zig zag.  After it chilled the children loved the zest sprinkled with more sugar.,,
541967,40,2007-07-20,5,My parents went like wow when they dranked it! :),,
715828,40,2008-01-17,5,FANTASTIC!!! Added some oranges because we didn't have enough lemons. I think I'll be making this for my daughters birthday party!!!,,
1060485,40,2009-01-23,5,This was awesome!! it was REALLY refreashing!,,
851190,40,2010-05-23,5,It was hot the other day and I decided to make some lemonade.  This really quenched our thirst and was awesome!,,
57256,41,2003-04-13,5,I thought this was very GOOD! ANYONE who is afraid of Tofu should try it this way. It gets a great smokey taste from being grilled and the veggies take on a nice sweetness when cooked this way!,,
1060485,41,2009-01-26,4,"This was SOO good! the marinade was awesome!! although i am not a big fan of tofu, it definally had some nice flavor. thanks!",,
1060485,43,2009-02-07,1,did not work.,,
81611,45,2003-09-07,5,"This was my first buttermilk pie (I had never heard of it before 'zaar!) I used a prepackaged graham cracker crust. This was such an easy recipe for such a yummy, comfort-food dessert! I was shocked to see the 2 layers form after baking; I assume that's normal? It all tasted just great, though. Maybe too sweet for some, but not for me!",,
1057076,45,2009-02-11,0,"Hi,I am trying to follow this recipe to make it and it is just confusing to me. Step # 2 says make pie crust, do not bake. Then in Step # 7 after pie has been baked it says Combine graham crumbs, gingersnap crumbs, and margarine in 8 or 9 inch pie pan, pat mixture evenly on bottom and side of pan. Then in step #8 it says .Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until edge of crust is lightly browned. I am totally confused . Tristitia could you reread the recipe , I am totally confused on the crust. 

Thanks",,
1060485,45,2009-02-17,3,flavor was a little bland. but it was easy to cook.,,
32421,48,2002-03-15,0,The flavor was great. But I think there was no need for margarine and oil in the cake batter. There was no instructions on what to do with the margarine. Next time I will try making it without the oil and mix as you would a regular cake batter.,,
68674,48,2004-05-03,2,"I picked this recipe over the other BCP recipes because the filling sounded yummy.  Unfortunatly it doesn't say what to do with the margerine or when to add it...so I put it in with the oil.  For the glaze there is suddenly a mention of confectioners sugar..but none in the ingredients list..so no idea how much was needed. I improvised but it's annoying to have to stop and figure stuff out when you're right in the middle of the whole thing.  The cake itself was quite heavy, but my husband likes a heavy cake, so that was OK and the flavour was good, as was the filling.  ",,
19893,49,2002-06-21,4,"I give this recipe a good to high rating because it just tastes good and is realitivly easy to make.  I used Cream Sherry as I didn't have any Marsala, and it turned out really good. Broiling the cheese is a really good idea, its adds just a little crunch that makes this dish supurb!",,
39835,49,2002-10-07,4,This is an easy-to-make and enjoyable dish. I made a few subsitutions in the recipe--instead of Marsala and chicken broth (which I didn't have)I used canned tomatoes and I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. It was great served with pasta.,,
69551,49,2003-05-18,5,"When I made it I didn't have any wine, so I used a few drops of spiced vinegar and sugar.  Also, as a variation I made it with pork chops, except I substituted the broth with apple juice, water, spiced vinegar, a touch of mustard and cinnamon.  Also, very good.  Both ways, definitely a keeper.",,
198709,49,2005-02-26,4,"This was easy enough to make (though, it took me longer because I could only cook two chicken filets at a time).  Very tasty.  If you use noodles, I would suggest to double (and perhaps triple) the amount of sauce (simmered chicken broth and marsala) at the end because it goes great over the noodles (I also recommend egg noodles for this dish).  Will definitely make again.",,
198344,49,2005-02-28,5,My Guests raved about this dish! I followed the directions exactly and it was wonderful. Served it with steamed asparagus and a green salad (no noodles or carbs of any kind).  My wife said to be sure to keep this recipe as it is now one of her favorite chicken dishes. ,,
365923,49,2007-08-20,5,My family loves this recipe !,,
564813,49,2008-02-21,0,"This dish is out of this world. I used marinaited capatella cheese, provalone, and parmesan. The combination of cheeses was wonderful. I made rosemary buttered noodles asa my side dish along with a nice crusty loaf of bread. YUMMY!!!! Cudos on this recipe Mrs. Q",,
385836,49,2008-04-04,5,This is an excellent dish. I opted to serve it with roasted potatoes instead of noodles. The combination was very delicious and made a nice presentation on the plate!,,
303726,49,2008-09-09,5,Love this dish!  Have made this for friends as well and everyone is always impressed.  Great flavor!,,
969289,49,2008-12-28,0,this is a real keeper. They even went back for seconds. served with salad and noodles with white sauce. Didn't change a thing except extra mushrooms. 5 stars,,
1060485,49,2009-02-18,5,this was SOOO good!! the flavor was awesome! all the flavors blended so well. it would be 6 stars if that was possible.,,
126440,49,2009-04-25,5,DH and I thought this was delicious.  I think next time I would make the entire recipe for the sauce but only use two breasts.  Excellent flavor and easy to do.,,
136828,49,2009-06-04,5,"When I first read through the ingredients, I thought that the quantity of marsala would overwhelm the dish, but, boy, was I wrong!  In spite of its great rich flavor, this recipe is much lighter than I expected. Easy to put together.  I did as one reviewer suggested and made the entire sauce recipe and only two chicken breasts (DH likes lots of sauce), and it was the perfect amount for our taste.  Served over fettucine with roasted asparagus on the side. This recipe's a keeper!!",,
1427914,49,2009-10-27,5,"DH & I really enjoyed this recipe!  I did saute onion, garlic & celery in with the mushrooms and it turned out awesome!  I also, as suggested by others, made the entire sauce recipe and only cooked 2 chicken breasts.  Will be making thisdish again soon.",,
797590,49,2009-11-19,5,"This was YUMMY!  My only changes were 4 chicken breasts(lrg) cut into 4 pieces each and I put the salt on the chicken before I dredged it in the flour.  I didn't have anything but white cooking wine and burgundy.  Did less than called for but upped the chicken broth.  Also didn't have fresh parmesan cheese :( but since I doubled the sauce, the chicken was almost floating.  Sprinkled the pre-grated parmesan and then covered with mozzarella.  Everyone of my family loved this.  Great quick chicken meal.  I will be stocking the staples for the future!",,
851190,49,2010-05-23,5,"We just loved this one!  I cut boneless chicken breasts into pieces, then followed the rest of the recipe.  It came out juicy and we loved the taste!",,
1284154,49,2010-07-12,5,Made this tonight and one word will describe it. AWSOME!  We cut it down for 2 and it was one of the best meals we have had in awhile.,,
178504,49,2013-04-07,5,"This was delicious !  I used 4 chicken breasts (which when cut and pounded made 8 nice pieces) and left all the other ingredient amounts the same.  I subbed fontina for the mozzarella.  The chicken comes out so tender and tasty, and I served it on linguini. My husband rated this as a restaurant-quality meal - thank you for sharing.",,
2013920,49,2015-01-05,5,"This was AMAZING with a few minor changes. I only used 6 breast halves, but the same amount of the sauce. I sauteed onions and garlic in the same pan after I removed the mushrooms.  To the sauce mixture I added dried oregano and thyme and added back the onions and garlic to let it all reduce together.    I served with mashed potatoes.",,
305461,49,2016-06-20,5,I have made this recipe and saut&eacute;ed the green onions with the mushrooms. Then removed and saut&eacute;ed the chicken breasts which I did not cover during cooking. Made my sauce in the same pan and poured over my chicken. I just had the butcher cut chicken breasts in half. Did not pound them. I baked for approximately 30 minutes covered and they came out great! The sauce is excellent!,,
10448,50,2004-12-15,5,This recipe is sooooo close to what you find in Italy.  I just needed the Vin Santo wine to dip it in.  The only change I made was that I used parchment paper on my baking sheets instead of the buttered and floured sheet.,,
1060485,50,2009-03-22,4,pretty good,,
133174,52,2004-08-02,5,"I haven't made this in years.  When the kids were small, I would make it for teachers gifts, etc.  I used 1/2 cup Splenda sugar substitute and 1/2 nonfat dry milk solid and 1/2 nonfat coffee creamer.  I find that adding the creamer makes for a richer tasting coffee.",,
557764,53,2009-07-09,3,"First Jimmy let me say that the taste was great! the reason I only gave 3 stars is because of the way the recipe was written, and wantedmaybe new cooks to have a heads up. It looks like a down home cake, not an upscale restuarant cake.  My family loves down home cakes. However, there is a few problems with the recipe itself In step 3 it says to add the oil, but the list of ingredients does not have oil .  I added 1/2 cup and it worked out fine.  and in your instructions you never mentioned the applesauce. I added this with the rest of my ingredients.
Love the texture, lots of different things going on with the walnuts carrots raisins and coconut.  I had never thought of using five spice like this and the flavor turned out great.
thanks Jim",,
53959,55,2006-01-12,4,I liked it. I was surprised since it didn't have sour cream  in it but it was pretty good. Thank you for sharing.,,
165567,55,2006-03-31,5,"I LOVED this recipe! I was looking for a guacamole recipe that was simple, easy and didn't use onion (allergy). Except for a little addition of chili powder and cayenne pepper, the recipe was followed and it was AMAZING! thanks for posting!!!!",,
1060485,55,2009-04-07,5,loved this! my family ate it all up! will deffinally make again! and i used natural lime juice and it turned our extra good!,,
851190,55,2010-05-23,5,I used Italian plum tomatoes for this as they are firm and not real juicy.  They worked great and the dip was awesome!  The lime really adds a depth of flavor that we just love!,,
437767,58,2007-12-26,3,"This was an OK stew, but I had to add many more vegetables and double the base to really make it a meal, which is what I expect when making a stew. Left out the pearl onions and used a white onion, sliced thickly. The flavor of the base may make it worth trying again.",,
162826,58,2008-03-09,5,"This is a great beef stew; didn't use the pearl onions, just sliced yellow...and used some left-over green beans for the sugar snaps.
Make for the Low-fat event in CPF.",,
5060,58,2008-11-20,5,"mmm mmm good! We enjoyed this stew very much.  I used ordinary stewing beef and used sherry for the wine, delicious!  I used less bably carrots and added celery, rutabega, fennel bulb and rather than pearl onions, which are to hard to get, used regular white onon and left out the snap peas in favour of the fennel bulb. I cut all the veggies into large chunks.  Also cut the cornstarch to just one tablespoon  which thickened it quite nicely.  Lovely favlourful stew, I will be makeing again.",,
1060485,58,2009-04-25,3,its aiight,,
1279229,58,2009-05-26,5,"This was an easy, tasty, and healthy stew. I used regular stew meat and yellow onions with carrots, celery, new potatoes, and parsnip as well as a few extra seasonings, including a pinch of powdered cayenne pepper and a 1/2 t. of sugar. The thickened gravy was especially good.",,
1041886,58,2009-12-11,5,made this in my slow cooker....delicious!,,
943739,58,2010-01-30,5,"A very good beef stew recipe! I used a regular sweet onion, diced, and 2 regular-sized carrots; no snap peas. I browned the meat in bacon fat instead of vegetable oil (since some beef stew recipes have bacon in them, I thought it would be good for the flavor) and it was very tasty! This will be my new standard recipe for beef stew!",,
91383,59,2003-07-07,5,"Made this dish for a as a starter for a dinner party one afternoon.
Everybody said........""warm bruschetta???""
They then proceeded to devour every last crumb of the stuff.
Fantastic recipe...thanks.",,
70793,59,2007-03-31,5,"A different kind of bruschetta, but I couldn't ask for a more tasty treat. I served these up as the first course of an italian feast for my parents anniversary. This wowed mom and dad. I have made it several times since, and it seems to get better and better. I add oregano, seasoning salt, pepper, some onion salt and garlic to the ricotta mixture and it is great. Thanks!",,
1060485,59,2009-05-11,5,VERY GOOD! everyone loved it!!,,
851190,59,2010-05-23,5,"I was having company and decided to make this for the appetizer.  It was very well received by all and I got lots of compliments, so you know it's good!",,
16408,62,2001-10-25,5,"This recipe was awesome! I took it to a family reunion, and it was gone in minutes!",,
14613,62,2001-11-20,4,"the combination of ingredients is smart, but this recipe as is desparately needs some sea salt and balsamic vinegar for that extra kick.",,
41550,62,2002-07-23,4,This was quite good and even better the second day after the flavors had more time to blend.  I used frozen corn to save time and it worked very well; I undercooked it just a bit to keep it's crunch.  Next time I would use less olive oil.,,
56061,62,2007-03-02,5,"We liked this recipe a lot because it's very flavorful.  As I've had a chance to adjust the recipe to our taste, it's evolved into something that we enjoy often.  We substitute lime juice for the lemon juice and significantly increase the amount.  I use frozen corn and instead of the fresh parsely leaves I use a lot of cilantro.  As mentioned by another reviewer, I throw in a good pinch of sea salt.  Usually, I substitute a finely minced red onion for the scallion.  I also find that the flavors in this salad improve greatly as it sits, so I try to make it the evening before we want to eat it.  This is a staple at our house!  It's very versatile and my kids love it with some chips or to roll into a tortilla.  Thank you for posting it!",,
175124,62,2007-03-27,5,"This was a delicious salad! We subbed coriander (cilantro) for the parsley and used frozen corn and cooked, dried beans.",,
385678,62,2007-04-09,5,This tasted great!  I also used a lot of cilantro.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!,,
350769,62,2007-04-26,5,"This salad is a complete, satisfying, refreshing and nutritious meal (and quite pretty too, I must say!). The next time around I will probably use less lemon juice; a bit too much 'zing' for my personal taste, but I will definately make it again.",,
475746,62,2007-06-20,5,Easy and simple.  We loved it. Thanks.,,
56003,62,2007-06-24,5,"Thanks, Dave, for a tasty and simple to make salad.  Served with #228639 Chipolte-Lime Grilled Cornish Rock Game Hens and it was a great side dish.  I, also, made with an extra tomato.  Had enough to have for lunch the next day.  Yummy!",,
549669,62,2007-08-06,4,"This recipe is one that I make again.  I loved all of the flavors and textures.  Unfortunately, the rest of my family didn't as much...but that's ok...more for me!",,
283251,62,2007-08-15,4,"Easy and delicious! I used frozen corn and served this with cuban spiced pork chops #134871. Very good. Needed a little salt and pepper, but a very nice summer salad. :)",,
30298,62,2007-11-08,5,"Delicious!  I will definitely make this again.  I brought it to a church function, and had requests for the link to your recipe.  I used frozen corn.  Thanks!",,
357323,62,2007-11-25,5,"Yummy! I was looking for something easy to whip up for a dinner party. The main dish was chicken enchiladas and this recipe made a great side dish. I threw this all together and heated it on the stove for about 10 minutes. I used a can of seasoned black beans, and I threw in some ground cumin and garlic salt. I didn't use lettuce leaves since I served it hot. Come summer I'll try this as a salad!",,
53448,62,2008-05-27,5,"Great! loved it. I used 3 types of beans, tripled the recipe and it was a hit. thanks for posting.",,
730763,62,2008-05-30,5,The flavors melded together nicely in this salad.   We ate it at room temperature and it was a BIG HIT!  Thanks Dave!,,
520620,62,2009-04-25,5,"Very flavorful! easy to put together, great summer salad thank you for posting",,
367847,62,2009-05-23,5,Great salad ... only addition I made was equal amounts of cilantro and parsley.  Will make again.,,
195750,62,2009-06-11,4,Really enjoyed this recipe.  Fresh ingredients that are really healthy.  Yum!,,
729254,62,2009-06-22,5,I loved this! Made recipe just as written. Beautiful simple flavors. Served this with some leftover chicken skewers and lettuce.,,
44383,62,2009-09-18,3,Wasn't thrilled with this salad much at all. Didn't like the texture of the black beans with corn and we found the whole thing pretty much tasteless.  Sorry but won't be repeating this one.,,
222970,62,2010-08-19,5,Very nice! Tasty dressing. The parsley was a nice touch. Cilantro would have worked as well. It was very good served as a side to spicy chicken fajitas with some rice and guacamole and summer squash.,,
171084,62,2013-01-01,5,"This a great with hamburgers after over a week of holiday food.  Simple, light and easy!  Taking some suggestions from other reviewers, I did add a dash of cilantro and also some chick peas I had left over from another recipe.  I loved the flavors!  Will make this again!",,
64625,63,2008-05-17,5,"A very tasty soup, easy to make, rich, hearty, satisfying.  I used some smoked sausage, and in addition to recipe ingredients added sliced carrots and celery stalks.  Had some turkey stock on hand which was a flavourful choice.  I didn't use the tip in Notes at bottom of recipe, although I did serve sourdough bread with the soup.  Well done, thanks for posting!  I appreciated it!",,
122210,63,2008-05-23,5,"This at on the very top of my ""all-time-favorite-Nick-Stellino's recipes"" list.  I serve it all the time and, when we are having a pot luck lunch at work, that's the only thing anyone wants me to bring.  It's delicious!",,
871291,63,2009-02-03,5,"Easy and fast to fix. I fixed it for my wife and she loved it. Using the sun dried tomatoes does not over ride the taste with tomato. Sausage helps to add flavor, andoulle sausage works well also.",,
1501478,63,2010-01-26,5,I made this recipe last night and it was great.  I changed the recipe a little using Hillshire FarmÂ® Turkey Polska Kielbasa and left out the white wine.  It was wonderful and I would highly recommend this recipe if asked.  Thanks for providing it.,,
42938,66,2002-10-21,4,This was an excellent sauce! I did cut it in half and still have some left for next time. It was really tangy and BH really liked it. He was the one who braved the cold and went outside to cook it on the grill after I had marinaded two ribs for about an hour. I gave him some extra sauce to baste with and all turned out well. The time it took to prepare and the long list of ingredients used was well worth it. I may even try this during the winter as a slow roast or even a crockpot recipe for ribs as I still have quite a few of them in the freezer.,,
8679,66,2003-03-17,5,"This was super quick and easy to make.  It has a wonderful, rich flavour and is equally nice for a brush on sauce on the grill or a slow cook method.  I added a small drop of liquid smoke flavour and extra garlic.  I've made this many times since I first found the recipe and everyone LOVES it.  Use it on any meat, it's great!",,
136813,66,2007-04-14,5,This is a great sauce!  The only change I made was to substitute apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  Next time I think I'm going to mix in chipotle powder with the chili powder for a smokey kick.,,
498631,66,2007-05-11,5,"Everyone loved it! I have to admit that barbecue sauce with coffee just didn't sound right, but we needed barbecue sauce and had all the right ingredients for this one. WOW! The whole family was raving over the barbecue sauce (and wanted to know the brand and store where we bought it!) Even grandma, who was sure that it would be too spicy for her, asked for more to dip her barbecued ribs into. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",,
352271,66,2007-11-05,5,Made this sauce to go on some bbq chicken.  Everone loved it!  Thanks Queen Dragon Mom.  Ann,,
314792,66,2008-02-04,5,I've used this on chicken and ribs now and it always gets rave reviews.    This is one of the few recipes I wouldn't dare to tweak - - its great just the way it is!,,
136004,66,2008-06-05,5,Outstanding!  The only change I made was add 2 Tblsp water (rather than add 1 Tblsp water to dry mustard).  Didn't have expresso so made a strong pot of coffee and added that.  Fabulous flavor - deep and rich.  We're going to have this one alot.  Thanks!,,
330545,66,2009-01-02,5,"What flavor!  Used on chicken and my son grabbed what was left of the sauce to take home.  Can't wait to try this on ribs now.  Made for the Comfort Cafe, a tag game.",,
675265,66,2009-01-10,5,Very nice flavored bbq sauce!  We enjoyed it on our ribs and chicken.,,
983723,66,2010-05-23,5,"What a great BBQ sauce!  My DW made it and I slathered it on chicken for grill.  All my kids raved about it, so we will use this often this summer.  Next time I plan to try it on some ribs!",,
133174,66,2010-07-04,5,Why would anyone buy barbecue sauce when this can be done in minutes?  It has a very nice blending of flavors.  It is very thick and rich.  Made for When It's Hot/When Its Not in the Diabetic Forum.,,
124416,66,2010-07-08,5,"Really good, flavorful.  Nice and thick.  I used only 1 each of the cumin and chili powder, will use 2 T. next time because it seemed a little too sweet.",,
383346,66,2010-07-09,5,This is great.  I made fresh espresso and did half the recipe.  I used red onion and omitted the garlic.  I didn't have hot dry mustard so used plain dry mustard.  I used it on chicken breasts.  But I have enough leftover to try on something else.  Thanks Queen Dragon Mom :)  Made for When it's hot event,,
744425,66,2010-07-11,5,"Dh wanted to buy a bbq sauce, but I said that's for wimps - the sauce they sell is basically overpriced ketchup.  I figured I'd find an easy 2-ingredient recipe, but instead, happened upon this one.  Far more effort than the 2-ingredient recipe would have been, but the taste is subtle, complex and delightful.  Yes, there's ketchup in it, but also a nice interplay of flavours that I'm sure will be a hit at our chicken BBQ tonight.  Thanks!",,
176798,66,2010-10-02,5,Awesome recipes.  I have used it several times now.,,
679953,66,2011-03-28,5,"Other than leaving out the dry mustard, made recipe as posted.  Great Sauce !!  Used it on some drumsticks tonight as they were on sale..  It definately beats some of the store brand names.  Made for I recommend.",,
2300352,66,2013-03-05,5,LOVED the flavor of this sauce! It's cool and rainy outside so I used it to baste some oven-roasted pork chops. It is simple to put together and so TASTY! I don't think I'm ever gonna buy it in a bottle again :),,
2542287,66,2013-07-22,5,This sauce is amazing. I have been looking for a recipe for a sauce similar to the sauce served at my favorite hometown rib joint. This is the closest thing I have found. I followed the recipe and only added 1/4 cup of bourbon.,,
2001180732,66,2016-09-24,5,I lerterally just made this sauce before I read this post. I made coffee bbq sauce and googled it and this is the exact same ingredients minus I added home made hot sauce. Mind blown,,
5974,67,2001-02-20,5,"This pound cake makes a great base for Strawberry shortcake.
The recipe does NOT half well, however it does freeze well and handy to have on hand for a quick dessert.
Use quality bourbon for the best taste.  I recommend Labrot & Graham's Woodford Reserve if you want to keep a very fine bourbon on hand for cooking, baking and drinking.  ;-)",,
86318,70,2003-09-07,0,"I don't think anyone would have done it, but the preheating mentioned in step 1 is much too early. The dough mentioned in step 4 was a batter. So I added enough flour (5 1/2 more cups), extra salt (1 teaspoon) and some oil (1 tablespoon - just because) to make a kneadable dough. I continued from there, and got 2 medium loaves (620 g each) and 17 rolls at about 45 g (1 1/2 oz) each. What can I say? The bread is delicious, but it's not really the bread of this recipe. And I'm not sure what the buckwheat flour contributes - maybe some texture, not much flavor what with the caraway seeds. We will eat the bread and enjoy it, but I don't think I'll try this again.",,
868335,70,2008-06-21,1,I believe there is a serious error in this recipe. Perhaps it should call for 2 Tbsp water instead of 2 cups? I had to add at least another 1 1/2 cups flour to get it to a kneadable stage. Not sure if it will turn out!,,

695362,82,2007-12-25,2,"This recipe is missing something.  I felt that the filling was a little bland.  Any suggestions on what spices to add to give it more of a kick?  Also, I found it was difficult using the muffin tin.  I used too much dough and my lids did not completely enlose it.  I think it would be easier to make it into a sealed taco, rather than a personal pot pie.",,
1193707,82,2009-05-25,0,"Newcook in New York, you can add any spices you want.  The thing is, ""Empadinhas"" are not spicy...  The dough, if correctly made, is extremely tasty and flaky; I don't know why, but we call it ""Massa Podre"" (rotten dough).  (I don't recall only egg yolk in the dough, by the way.)  My grandmother used to make them all the time.  They are actually made in very small individual tins.  It's A LOT of work, since each individual tiny tin has to be buttered and then arranged on a cookie panto take them to the oven. People nowadays buy them already made, for parties.",,

424741,84,2007-01-13,5,This was excellent.  Wonderful flavor.  Perfect texture.  I cut the recipe in half but otherwise followed it exactly (using the option to cut the sprouts in half).  I was also fortunate enough to have fresh brussels sprouts from the farmers market.  The wine vinegar I have is probably not the best.  It would probably be even better with a better quality vinegar.  I might even try it with balsamic....,,

These I chopped and added to some cold leftover fettuccine with some halved cherry tomatoes and shredded chicken, all mixed together with some garlic mayonaise. An easy meal for my lunch.  These sprouts are a keeper for me :)",,
27678,85,2005-03-25,5,"A perfect cake. I actually need it to use for another recipe, but couldn't bear to buy one in the supermarket, full of E-numbers and other horrible things, when this is so easy to make. The only thing I found was that my baking time was less than is given here -- about 1 hour total. Perhaps this is because I am using a fan oven but in any case it pays to keep an eye on the cake and test periodically.",,
273254,85,2009-02-09,5,This recipe is so easy and the cake was absolutely fabulous! I added an extra tablespoon of milk because the batter seemed a bit thick. I used a round cake tin and cooked it for an hour and ten minutes at 150C. It came out perfect. This is definitely one I'll be using often. Thanks for the recipe!,,

601227,91,2008-05-17,5,"I did not add the savory,snow peas,lemon or coconut. Just didn't have these on hand. Don't know that I would even use the coconut. BUT, what I did do is: Sautee the gr. onion, celery, ginger and fresh garlic in the 3 TBL butter. Added the chicken broth. Brought it to a boil then added sliced carrots the broccoli, mushrooms, oregano, marjoram, fresh basil and the rice. Brought that to a boil and then simmered for 20 minutes. Absolutely delicious! Next time I will add some slivered water chestnuts for some crunch. Yum!!",,
194829,91,2009-01-29,5,"Very good... I'm snowed in here in central Kentucky, trying to cook with what I have on hand. I had a big bag of brown rice and little else. Used dried rosemary and oregano in rice, then Sauteed onions, carrots, and celery in EVOO until tender. Excellent recipe. Thanks!",,

Its a very easy & versatile recipe that gives great flavour to plain old boring brown rice. Due to lack of ingredients, I made the following substitutions: dried thyme for savory, powdered ginger for fresh, purple onion for green & lemon pepper for zest. I added dethawed frozen pea pods & broccoli florets once the celery & onions were tender. I'll repeat this recipe with different veggie combinations in the future. Thanx Robb!",,

10701,100,2001-06-06,3,was a bit fiddley but good. I used Wild Turkey bourbon instead & added a few rasins.,,
27678,109,2006-02-02,5,"Wow, talk about full of flavour. I think this recipe would please nearly everyone because it hasn't got any strong spices but it's still incredibly tasty. The lemon and pepper flavours really compliment the lamb and the juices from the meat give the potatoes lots of flavour. I used leg of lamb fillets, which were done after about 25 minutes.",,
983811,109,2010-05-23,5,"The lamb was so tender and everything had so much flavor, it was hard to stop eating!  I loved the juice the lemon made and it was great drizzled over the potatoes.

20371,112,2001-10-28,4,"Three comments about this recipe. (1) It's absolutely delicious! (2) I was afraid there wouldn't be enough sauce, so I made 1-1/2 times the amount called for (i.e., 6 tbsp butter and flour, 3 c. milk, 1 can condensed chicken broth + 1 c. water, and I used 4 eggs) and I'm glad I did -- I used every bit. (3) The 15 min prep time listed is quite wrong...by the time I chopped the chicken, the broccoli, the onion, minced the garlic, grated the mozzarella, made the sauce ... well,you get the picture. It took me almost an hour to prepare. But it was well worth the effort and I will definitely make this again -- my family LOVED it.",,
20160,112,2002-02-16,5,I really liked this too.  I sprinkles with alot of red pepper flakes at the table - can't add in as I have little people to feed.  I will definatly make this again.,,
20214,112,2002-02-25,3,"This is not bad.  I think if I made it again, I would skip the chicken broth all together and just just use 3 cups of milk.  (Just a straight white sauce).  I wasn't too thrilled with the taste of the sauce.  I used ""express"" lasagna noodles (ones that you don't have to pre-boil), and it didn't work that well in this recipe.
It made the noodles very tough - hard to even cut!
Sassy.",,
6512,112,2002-03-28,4,"Wonderful blend of tastes. We love cheese so this dish hit the spot. Prep time was more like 35 minutes. I used whole leg quarters and since I am on low carb diet left out the noodles. Did not increase sauce since I did not use noodles. Careful with the nutmeg, do NOT add more than a pinch, or it will change the taste of the dish.",,
87563,112,2004-02-16,4,"This was a good recipe, but I thought the sauce was a little bland. I added extra ground red pepper, black pepper, and garlic powder to try and give it a boost.  I took Lennie's advice and made 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce.  It was about the perfect amount. I also added about twice the amount of minced garlic to the chicken cubes for extra flavor.  Overall, I think this is a good recipe, and I will make it again with minor seasoning changes.",,

I made the mistake of adding the shredded cheese to the flour and  butter mixture instead of the parmesan, but it turned out okay. Just a little ""gooier"".  Gooey is ALWAYS good in my book!  I also added diced red pepper to the chicken and broccoli just for some color.  Otherwise, a great recipe!  Thanks Libby1!",,
719181,112,2008-07-29,2,"This recipe needs to be more concise.  It doesn't specify temperature to cook things on the stovetop in, nor what seasonings to use when.  I made it and it was pretty darn awful.",,

107583,114,2007-01-28,5,"This was really good.  I, too, used sherry, and I think it gave it a nice nutty flavor.  This is a recipe I could assemble ahead of time and make in the RV, where crockpotting is so handy!  Thanks for posting!",,
394085,114,2008-01-31,5,"Oh yum!...although I didn't make it exactly as ordered.   I like crunch more than moist and tender, so made it as specified through the browning of the chicken rolls ... then continued sauteeing on the stovetop for another half-hour/45 minutes..or so.

I have to say your recipe is perfection.  I made this for a baby's first birthday and used part of the batter in a little 6 inch pan for the baby (so she could maul it, which she did and it was adorable) - and put the remainder in a standard tube pan for the adults.  I had omitted the nuts because of the baby, but topped the large cake with toasted pecans. Everyone raved about it, and had 2nds.  People love to add all kinds of things to carrot cake (raisins, pineapple etc), and those are ok - but I really prefer the elegance and texture of your recipe.  I grated the carrots by hand (I really wish I owned a food processor), on the tiny tiny side, so basically had pulp - it works out to be about 3 heaping cups, if anyone needs that as comparison.  The texture of the cake was like velvet, very moist but not heavy, as this type of cake can be.  Obviously I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for posting it, and I'm sure I'll never again use any other carrot cake recipe... oh one more thing, this recipe is super easy and I think even a novice baker would have success.  The only thing that took any time at all, was grating the carrots, and if you have a food processor, that would only take a few minutes.  Ok, I'll shut up now, thanks again.",,

I didn't have any sugar cookies on hand when I was making them, so I used graham cracker crumbs with butter and sugar for the bottom instead. I later made more with the sugar cookies. Both turned out fabulous! Thanks for a tasty recipe!",,

297557,136,2008-05-11,3,"I give this recipe three stars for taste and simplicity for making the filling.  I used the slice-and-bake sugar cookie dough and then trimmed it to fit the cups.  I would suggest a graham crust...this process was a little long.  Also, I substiturted a combo of raspberries & strawberries and it left the filling a little loose and watery in spots.",,

582099,139,2007-12-29,5,"Mmm, yummy!  My sister made this for lunch the other day, and I think I'll make it for supper tonight.  She skipped the shredded coconut & onions, and used canned ginger.  Turned out very tasty, a nice change in pace for chicken salad.  Sweet and spicy.",,
1177291,139,2009-03-12,5,"This turned out really well.  In a hurry to make the salad, I forgot to toast the coconut, but the salad was still yummy!  Someone was entralled enough with it to want the recipe!

Thanks a lot!",,
937870,139,2009-08-31,5,"This curried mayonnaise is fantastic (it deserves 10 stars).  I didnt have coconut milk at home so used coconut cream instead and have made four batches already (and I have only had the recipe for a week).
Neither I, nor my family are coconut fans, so I made my own chicken salad and just used the curried mayonnaise dressing with it and it is a new family favourite recipe, thank you so much for the amazing mayonnaise!",,

914114,142,2012-04-09,4,Came out great for a chocolate Easter cake. I made an almond cream cheese frosting instead of a chocolate glaze to make it more Spring-like. Very moist and the banana is definately the strongest flavor coming from the cake. Will definately make again.,,
10881,142,2001-06-11,5,"This cake was moist and tasty and stayed that way until all gone 2 days later. My non-cake liking husband gave it a ""4""!

168462,142,2007-09-30,4,"I made this cake as part of the cake-a-thon in memory of Chef-I-Am. It is a very moist cake and it stayed moist for the two days it lasted in my house. I opted to use the 1/2 tsp, of almond extract and it was perfect. In my oven this cake baked in exactly 47 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.",,
446671,142,2007-10-22,5,Good moist cake and fairy easy to make. I made it in a bundt pan and drizzled a chocolate glaze recipe I found here and it was great. My only modification was to leave out the chopped almonds b/c I didn't have any. I also added a few drops of banana extract to the glaze. Yummy and looks great too!,,
315301,142,2007-11-24,5,This is an additional recipe I chose to bake in memory of CoolMonday in the bake-a-thon. I love the flavor of this cake!:) It reminds me of banana bread. This recipe was easy to follow. Another great recipe from CoolMonday and a wonderful tribute in memory of her. ~~ Chef mamma,,
260975,142,2007-11-26,5,I made this for the bake-a-thon for CoolMonday and I am so glad I did! It was so good! The banana and chocolate go so good together! This one is going to stay in my cookbook!,,
113941,142,2007-12-05,5,"This cake was truely OUTSTANDING!! The combination of the almonds, almond extract, chocolate and banana was a slice of HEAVEN! WOW!!! My hubby took this to work with him, so I didn't think I was going to get any! LOL! But he surprised me with a piece that he saved back for me!! SO GLAD HE DID!!! I will be making this recipe a lot!! (The cake was done perfectly in 45 minutes exactly. *Also, I greased my pan with butter-flavored crisco, and dusted it lightly inside with cocoa powder. The cake came out EASILY with no trouble at all! :)) Made for CoolMonday's Bake-a-thon.",,
169969,142,2007-12-16,5,I made this cake for my MIL2B's birthday a few weeks ago in loving memory of *CoolMonday* The amaretto was a wonderful addition to this recipe! It is like a sweet banana bread elevated to cake status.... simply delicious! I wouldn't change a thing and I will be making this one again!  Made for CoolMonday's Bake-a-thon.,,
513784,142,2008-01-23,5,"Absolutely delicious.  I used 4 egg whites and 1 whole egg, added one extra banana and cut down on the butter a little bit because of it, used 2/3 cup of Amaretto and omitted the almonds because I didn't have any on hand.  Even with my substitutions the cake still came out so moist and perfect!  To make a glaze I boiled 1/4 cup sugar and 1/8 water with some almond extraxt and then poured it over the hot cake; it gave it a nice crispy, sugary glaze on top.  The only change I'll make next time is to let it sit for a day before serving because I found the almond flvouring really came through when I had a piece a day later instead of the day it was made.  I think this will definitely become a family favourite!",,
99979,142,2008-01-29,5,Delicious!!  Absolutely loved it!  I used the chocolate icing from recipe #27144 & sprinkled slivered almonds on top.  Went together perfectly!,,
121354,142,2008-02-23,2,"Step 11 states to ""drizzle glaze over top and down side of cake"", but WHAT glaze? I'd already used all the ingredients in the cake, and hadn't set aside anything to use to make a glaze. While it smelled fabulous while baking, and had a moist, dense texture, the flavor didn't measure up. I did substitue unsalted butter for the margarine, and generic almonds instead of Dole brand (but I would think the butter would have made it better, not worse). I did make my own glaze, which was fine, but it really didn't help the cake.",,
537188,142,2008-05-04,4,This was a lovely banana cake! I couldn't taste the almond but it didn't really matter.,,
93006,142,2008-07-18,5,"We absolutely loved this!  No, the almond didn't really come through but I think lent a real smoothness to this delicious cake.  I added an extra banana so probably should have upped the baking soda a bit, but it made for such a moist, dense cake I can't complain!  Used the glaze from recipe 27144 - to die for!  Will definitely keep this one!",,
854982,142,2008-09-06,5,Love this cake!  Let it sit for a day to allow the flavors to develop and it's even better.  I will definitely be using this recipe over and over.,,
709476,142,2009-04-21,5,"The only problem with this cake is that is SO delicious that I am having a hard time not eating more than I should!  Oh, my!  This is wonderful!  I used 4 bananas and butter, but wanted a soft cake so I didn't add the almonds.  I also used a chocolate glaze instead.  Incredibly delicious!",,
129652,142,2009-11-02,4,This was good.  I made it for a brunch and about half of it was eaten.  My kids enjoyed getting to eat the rest.  It's worth trying once.,,
1386579,142,2010-01-26,5,Excellent cake.  I used this for my Dad's 74 birthday - he loved it.  The cake is moist and the flavor is delicious.  I did make it the night before to let the flavor intensify.  I used a 10 inch angel food pan and I poured a chocolate glaze over the top.  There was not a piece left.  I already have requests from other family members for their birthday.  Thanks for a great recipe.,,
350750,142,2010-05-22,5,"What a great tasting cake! Instead of margarine used crisco, used almond extract, also didn't toast the almond just cut them fine.  I took this to a graduation party and it was liked by many people. Thanks for helping me use up some old bananas!",,
797995,142,2010-05-23,5,"What a find! A great way to use up all of those spotty bananas instead of another loaf of banana bread. I left mine unadorned. It is lovely and sweet enough without any icing or glaze. This cake has a fine crumb and is very moist. I subbed out the almonds and almond liqueur/extract for banana liqueur, vanilla and a drop of orange extract; and added 1/4 or so cup of wheat germ. Like another reviewer I used Crisco... it was what I had on hand. Took the full 50 minutes in my oven. Just a lovely cake.",,
1573569,142,2010-07-03,5,"A wonderful cake.  Did not have almonds, use pecans.  Used Dutch cocoa.  A moist not too sweet cake.  Served plain to family. A dusting of powdered sugar would be nice for company presentation.  Next time I'll use filberts (hazelnuts) and Frangelico.",,
946081,142,2010-08-15,5,"This was awesome! I made it for my Dad's birthday and he just loved it. Along with everyone else at the party. My only problem was it stuck in my bundt pan some, but I think that is my fault. I sprayed the pan really well... but didn't flour it... so might have to try that next time... and there will definitely be a next time!!! Thanks for a great recipe!",,
1625628,142,2010-09-03,5,Yum! This cake was gone in no time. It was really light and moist.I used butter. I cut the sugar down to 1c and  I also didn't make a glaze for it and it was delicious and sweet enough for us. My boyfriend went out and bought more bananas for me to make it again!,,
16459,143,2003-08-18,4,"This was terrific. I love bruschetta and this was a great recipe. In addition to using the cherry tomato toppings, I also used Gay's recipe for Rosemary White Beans and ate them on top of the bread. Thanks for posting the recipe.",,
27643,143,2003-08-19,5,I can't believe this recipe hasn't been found and reviewed yet. This is so good! I used french bread from the deli and this went together very easily. I let the tomato mixture marinate for 4 hours for maximum flavor. Served this with pasta. Thanks Troy!,,
5060,143,2004-08-01,4,"We did enjoy the taste of this very much, we were just not quite sure how to eat it!  In the end we picked it up and made a very tasty mess!!  The taste is outstanding , we love the mix of balsamic vinegar and EVO oil, of course the garlic was great as were the rosemary and parsley.  Also loved the crusty cheese toast under it.  All in all it was almost too much of a good thing, almost an overpowering taste. We probably will make it again but would cut back on almost everything, except the cheese and bread. Thanks for sharing a good brushetta.",,
85018,143,2004-08-02,5,"Had this for Sunday lunch-really great!!!  Used mixture of various types and colors of cherry tomatoes that I roughly chopped.  Also used julienned fresh basil instead of rosemary. Had some nice smoked provolone, so used that.  Ate it with a knife and fork-wonderful, fresh, summer-like sandwich!!",,
1037241,143,2010-05-09,5,I made this for Mother's Day and everyone loved it.  Very light and full of flavor!,,
983863,143,2010-05-27,5,"I made some to go with some pasta we were having for dinner.  We loved it!  The only change I made was to use the grape tomatoes sliced, which worked well because they don't squirt you in the eye when you bite into them lol",,
5471,144,2001-01-29,3,"It was pretty good, but then again I was really hungry.  Needs more chicken and more cheese.",,
174711,146,2007-04-11,3,"Very unusual apple pie. The Southern Comfort gives it a slightly ""smoky"" flavor and mixed with the sugars it becomes a very rich, though not terribly sweet, caramel. I used Granny Smiths, but will use a less tart apple next time. Did get very mixed reviews on this, sharply divided between sweet-eaters versus non-sweet-eaters. The people who love cookies and candy didn't like it. The people who don't eat sweets loved it! I will make it again for the family because the regulars thought it was great.

Quick, easy and all you need is a small oven.",,
111342,150,2004-08-10,5,"This was great.  I tweaked it a little and here's what I came up with.  I used Lawry's ""Prefect Blend"" for Poultry seasoning rather than the Tony Chachere's, added some green peas and thickened the broth/gravy with some instant potatoes.  Cooked on low for 6 hours, took the chicken off the bones and served over mashed potatoes.  Really yummy, almost like a Chicken A La King.",,
170320,150,2004-10-30,5,This is great way to cook chicken for all kinds of uses. I choose to put it over mashpotatoes as Parrot Head Mama suggested and it was great. Thanks alot for the ideas!,,
204118,150,2005-04-26,5,"I used this recipe to make meat for fajitas and it was wonderful. I used 4 chopped, boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I used red and green peppers, as well as green and red onion.  The mixture is very watery and has to be strained off, but it is great for fajitas.",,
245024,150,2005-09-30,5,Loved this and I actually cooked it for 24 hours (It was 10 pm after 8 hours and didn't want to put a hot chicken in the fridge so I left it on all night) The chicken was very tender and it made the BEST broth! I may do this once a week just for the broth.,,
422608,150,2007-01-12,5,This was great. I screwed up and added to much water. I didn't have Cajun seasoning so used poultry spice blend and lemon pepper. Obviously not enough lemon pepper but still was good.,,
39038,150,2007-11-01,3,"Made this for family as I can't take things to hot and they liked it lot!  I put it over rice and tasted it, but it WAS too spicy for me but not for normal folks! :)",,
766989,150,2008-03-18,5,"Tasty!  I used 3 bone in breast pieces and cooked it over night.  Didnt know what to do with it, so shredded the chicken and strained off the liquid.  Added some corn starch to thicken the liquid up some.  Tossed the chicken, some fresh veggies, and the broth back into the crock.  I didnt have any cream or sour cream so i added a bit of yogurt.  Served over mashed taters but would be good with rice or alone.",,
756218,150,2008-08-23,5,"This was very easy and very delicious! I'm a new wife and until now have not had very good luck with chicken. It is always dry and tough. But I followed your recipe as close as I could and made a big pot full of moist tasty shredded chicken.(froze most for later use) My husband was impressed! I used six frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts, and I used all the veggies in your recipe with the exception of the green onion. I had a white one on hand. and I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used what I had. Turned out Fabulous!",,
88373,150,2009-01-21,5,"This was great! It turned into Chicken Soup by mistake but it is really simple and tasty. I also didnt use cajun seasoning, just not a fan, so I used a mix of seasons and I have turned it into soup and pot pie so far!",,
832439,150,2009-10-07,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe.  Since I cook for just myself, a whole chicken would be just too much chicken for me and so I used two boneless-skinless chicken breasts.  Also, I used a yellow onion (chopped) instead of green onions and a red bell pepper because I prefer red to green bell peppers.  I will definitely use this recipe again with just one minor change:  I think chicken broth will work better for me instead of water because of the small amount of chicken I cook, i.e., two boneless-skinless breasts vs. a whole chicken.  Thank you for posting this easy recipe â€“ it was so nice to come home to cooked chicken that was ready to go.",,

828845,153,2008-04-29,5,"My husband & I are both diabetic.  I used a sugar substitute baking blend, sugar-free pudding mix, and used 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce & 1/2 c. oil (instead of 1 c. oil).  Turned out great.  A real hit.",,
607815,153,2008-06-08,0,"This is awesome!  My friend & went through several ""rounds"" of Amish friendship bread several years ago & loved it.  We both had problems giving the starter away, so we eventually quit.  Now we can ""start"" it anytime, then quit.  Thank you!",,
177753,153,2008-07-10,5,"I was given a start of this as a gift for my wedding. I didn't realize it was a sweet type bread until I actually started making it on the 10th day. I was surprised that this actually turned out how it was supposed to and it tastes great, a lot like a coffee cake! I also used the plastic bag method and it worked very well. I'm going to stick one in the freezer and give the others away tomorrow at work. Thanks for a great recipe!",,
281399,153,2008-08-25,5,I was given a starter and happy to find a recipe that I could use. I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup unsweetned apple sauce. I left out the nuts.  Also used the cinnamon/sugar but only used about 2 tbsp of it. I baked it in a bundt pan  65 minutes at 325 degress. Thanks for sharing this recipe.,,
114027,153,2008-08-28,5,This worked out perfectly...I am about to give away my second set of starters :),,
259154,153,2008-09-02,5,This bread and starter are really good. I have since gone to the 10 day version after this initial 27 day period and it has worked fine. The bread is very good. I sprayed three medium sized aluminum loaf pans and then coated them with a smattering of cinnamon/sugar mixture. I poured in the batter then coated the top with more cinnamon/sugar. Man was it good. I planned to take a loaf to work but it never made it there. My friend planned the same thing and hers never made it either. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.,,
522275,153,2009-02-24,5,"I omitted the nuts and sugar -- it has been plenty sweet to everyone else with rave reviews all around, and I don't think it needs the extra sugar!  :o)  I put it all in one 9x5 stone loaf pan and had no problems (bake time was a bit longer, and I did cover with foil for the last ten minutes)  Definitely delicious!",,
738763,153,2009-07-24,5,"Oh, this bread is so good, I can't leave it alone, and neither can anyone else in my family!  I have to keep a starter going all the time lately so we have some on the counter to enjoy.  My DW and I love that it's so moist, and the nuts really add another dimension of flavor.  You can vary them using Macadamia, Almonds, Pistashio, Walnuts or Pecans with great results!  We like Pecans the best, but the Macadamia and Walnuts go over well also!",,
353381,153,2009-09-15,5,"Awesome!  I made this painless starter in a 1-gallon ziploc bag.  You DO NOT need to add any yeast.  When it was time to bake the bread, I froze the two starters you are supposed to give to friends.  In place of the 1 cup of oil, I used applesauce, with no problems.  I have also substituted different flour combinations: white, whole wheat, whole wheat pastry, golden white.  Our favorite has been half golden white and half whole wheat.  I have also used sugar-free vanilla pudding and liked that just as much.  The starters that I froze taste just as good as the ""fresh"" ones. Everyone I have made this for loves it!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!",,
607333,153,2010-01-27,0,"Thanks for the starter recipe. I remember this from years ago.

It is in the oven now so not sure how the substitute will be, but if it flops I can now get some more started for her.  Thanks again.",,

888256,153,2010-02-26,0,"@ rnmommy02 - you need air to get to it to allow wild yeast to grow in your starter, and then it's going to produce gas and ferment.  Keeping it in a closed container will likely reuslt in your bag exploding.  Try a mason or 1/2 gallon pickle jar with a dish towel draped over it.",,
465080,153,2010-04-10,5,Thank you for posting this as I misplaced the instructions that came with the starter.  Now the starter has been 'fed' while I'm on the hunt for that elusive piece of paper!,,

2001658197,153,2017-08-05,0,To those who have had mold issues- A friend gave me a recipe for this bread several years ago and it says you should NOT have it completely covered.

192972,154,2007-12-13,5,"This will be a favorite. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, 2 t. baking powder, and melted 1 or 2 T. butter in the brownie pan before pouring in the batter. Best cornbread I've had in a long time. Cut up nicely too & not crumbly!",,
1255964,154,2009-05-02,0,"Sorry but my family really hated this.  It was awful.  They (husband & 2 adult sons) said it was terrible and I have to agree with them.  I'm no novice, I have been baking cornbread since I was 12.  My dad taught me to bake cornbread and it never tasted this awful.",,
63128,156,2003-08-12,3,"This was okay, but not as great a flavor combination as I hoped for.  I think slicing the celery into small pieces and adding this mixture to a salad would work better.",,
234062,156,2007-04-12,3,"This was very interesting, but quite good. It took the edge off the celery, and made it easier to eat. Will definitely do it again.",,
327989,161,2007-03-06,0,"Confused about the 1 chicken breast listed in this. The chicken breast would have to be huge to even fit inside of the measurements laid out. (12*17)
I would figure you would shred the chicken and spread with the vegetables to make it stretch. But I couldn't imagine feeding my family of 6 with 1 chicken breast. It would make a lot of dough though.
Maybe this would be better if you shredded the chicken and mixed with vegetables, then laid it down the middle and ""mock"" braided it. I would also increase the chicken to 2 pieces if done this way at the very least.",,
2312,164,2000-10-20,5,"MMMM, I love this stuff. Quite elegant, and even the liver-squeemish like it as long as they don't know.",,

22920,167,2001-11-23,4,Very good recipe!  It taste terrific!,,
44650,167,2003-01-01,5,I made these for our family New Year's Eve party. What a hit. They were really super tasting and very easy to make. I did make just a little revision since we always have a big crowd. I doubled the recipe and added to the filling: 2 Tbs Grated Parmesan Cheese and 2 cans of well drained Crabmeat. This filled 2-12oz pkgs of mushroom caps. Thanks for the great recipe!!,,
82296,167,2004-01-04,5,"Appreciated the package size designation rather than the number of mushrooms.  Used green onions rather than regular onions, and substituted dill for oregano.  I usually butter the cookie sheet rather than grease it.  Tasty!",,
4470,167,2004-10-03,5,Very Tasty and a nice change from having cheese in every recipe. They took 12 minutes in the oven - Iput a piece of foil over the top for the first 5 minutes. The mushrooms were very thick.. I cut the recipe back to 6 mushrooms. Thanks AnnJoy for a recipe that I'll enjoy as an appetizer and for Sunday Brunch,,

581193,167,2008-01-23,2,I made these a while ago and forgot to rate them then. I remember thinking I wouldn't make them again.,,

35925,167,2008-07-28,5,"I served these at my wine tasting party - mushrooms are great to mix with a red wine.  One of the hits of the party!  With all of the food I was serving, it was nice to have a ""lighter"" appetizer vs the typical sausage and cheese stuffing.  Quick and easy, and the house smelled great while they were cooking.  I doubled the recipe and only had 3 or 4 left over.  A definite repeat!",,
291358,167,2008-11-27,5,"Excellent mushrooms without a lot of work.  Great savory flavoring that is perfect without cheese (in fact, cheese might ruin this recipe in my opinion).  Both my husband and I devoured these.  I used an 8 oz package of cremini mushrooms, which we thought were great, but don't know if there might be better ones to choose from?  I cooked them for about 10 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Agree with others that this is a great light-tasting recipe.  Will definitely repeat!",,
457321,167,2009-01-06,5,"Excellent!  I used just under 8 oz of mushrooms, but left out the celery (don't care for it), used green onions, used parmesan flavored breadcrumbs, and sauteed in olive oil, rather than butter.  Baked for 7 minutes at 400 degrees.  They were delicious, but a bit salty (probably the parmesan).  So easy and delicious!",,
374498,167,2009-04-19,4,I made these for my husband who likes mushrooms.  It was a good recipe.  Easy to make.  Not my favorite stuffing for the mushrooms though.  My husband liked it but I was wanting a different kind of stuffing.  I'd probably make these again though.,,
138449,167,2009-07-21,5,"I added cheese.  I couldn't help it, I know other reviews liked the fact that there was no cheese.  These were great!  They were even better the next day when I took the extras for lunch.",,
1287603,167,2010-01-21,5,I decided to try this recipe just for fun && it was quite delicious!! I had a roasted chicken in the fridge && chopped some of that up && threw it in the stuffing. I also topped them with a pinch of cheese && added some garlic to it since I LOVE garlic!!,,
744939,167,2010-06-02,5,I added garlic and small pieces of shrimp to mine.  We loved them!,,
307059,167,2011-06-08,4,Enjoyed these stuffed mushrooms.  I tried them as written at first. They were okay.  Next I added a little cheese and a little garlic and enjoyed them more.  Thanks for sharing.,,
65631,167,2012-11-24,5,"I made these for Thanksgiving, I doubled the recipe and I did good get one myself! Wow, are they good. I sprinkled a little parmesan on top before I baked them and cooked them a little longer than suggested. I'm sure I will be making these for Christmas too!",,

39210,170,2002-05-02,3,"Good, easy to make and healthy. It is similar to a recipe I have used in the past which used a can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can of milk instead of the tomatoes. Any vegetable could be used instead of the squash.",,
96665,170,2003-08-05,5,I added a layer of mushrooms when I made this.  My husband loved it and ate almost the whole thing by himself.,,

I used ground pork instead of ground beef, since I'm trying to reduce the amount of beef we eat.  I added green beans, carrots and mushrooms, as an extra layer between the meat which I split into two layers.<br/><br/>I thought it was a bit strange to just put the canned tomatoes on top, but it totally worked.  They and the peppers in the second last layer baked into a delicious sort of crust.",,
323545,171,2010-03-27,4,This was one of my favorite recipes that my mom made growing up. The only difference was that she added a packet of onion soup mix with the soup and milk. It gives just a little extra flavor. So glad you posted this on here!,,

The kids chowed down on theirs and ate in silence, which means they are too busy eating and liking it to talk!  I did made a few changes for our tastes.  I didn't use the red pepper, and I used Cheddar cheese instead of Swiss, as I'm not crazy about Swiss cheese.  Other than that made like the recipe.  We will have again cause when the kids like something, I make it often!",,
262966,172,2009-05-16,4,"This was a very good and original recipe.  We did not use any ricotta cheese, only because no one in my family really cares for it, so we used extra mozzarella and cheddar cheese (no swiss).  I left out the peas and thyme b/c in the directions it was left out so I just forgot about those ingredients and it still turned out well, although next time I want to definitely add the peas.  When I sauteed the chicken initially, I coated it in some montreal chicken seasoning to add another layer of flavor and I'm glad I did or I think it would have been missing something.  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic to the carrots, mushrooms and onion.  Use chicken broth instead of sherry b/c I didn't have any on hand.  Definitely a keeper and one you can play around with to suit your own tastes!!",,
648093,172,2009-09-29,5,My family really liked this! From the 15 yo down to the 3 yo and including my dh they all ate through their portions and then some. I used thin no-bake lasagna noodles to avoid one more step. My kids asked me to repeat this meal. Thanks for the original recipe.,,

62086,181,2004-06-02,3,"I followed the recipe exactly, aside from removing the chicken from the pan to make the sauce, then adding it back in at the end.  I think it had good flavor (I used fresh basil and white onion), but I'm sorry I can't say it was outstanding.  I was hoping for a bit more liquid, which I didn't get, and it definitely needed a little more salt and pepper at the end.  I did add the butter, but it would have been better with more sauce.  Adding chicken broth to make a sauce might be a big help.  Also, for a novice cook the recipe might be hard to figure out, as it gives no cook time for the chicken, nor does it say when to add the garlic. ",,
17803,181,2005-03-07,4,"Very simple recipe that has  rather a plain taste.  We also added salt and pepper with our choice of herb, basil.

The date amount was dropped to between 2 and 3 ozs and they were not boiled but chopped and added. The cola became Diet Cherry Vanilla Coke and it was used cold. The brown sugar became 1/3 cup of Splenda.The extracts were 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and cherry and I skipped the nuts. Even with these changes it's wonderful in flavor and light and very tender inside. I will use an 8x4"" pan next time I make this as it didn't get very high in the 9x5 I used. I find it plenty sweet enough with the drastic cut in the dates and sugar. I don't even want to imagine how sweet it would be in the original form. This is easy to put together and bakes up a to a very nice color. My DH came following his nose for the second time today asking what was baking.",,

600146,186,2011-06-08,5,"Delicious!  This is amazing with vanilla ice cream. I made the cake exactly as the directions said, but I did add a bit more cocoa to the frosting and left out the nuts because my family isn't very wild on nuts.  I will make this again, and thanks for sharing with us!",,

70073,187,2007-02-05,5,"A very tasty steak and gravy recipe. We loved the gravy. I didn't have any bock beer (a lager beer) so I used canned chicken broth. You could turn the gravy portion of this recipe into a creamy homemade gravy recipe with different flavorings such as beef or chicken soup base mix added to the flour. I served it with buttered carrots and mashed potatoes, made with butter and cream and kosher salt, and whipped until creamy in my KitchenAid mixer(preheat the bowl with hot water before adding the cooked potatoes). Yum.",,
632657,187,2008-06-05,4,Delicious! The flour seasoning was just perfect and it fried up nicely.  I used onion salt in the gravy and added more pepper (I love ground pepper).  This gravy is also great over sausage and biscuits.,,
819206,187,2009-02-07,5,Very good! I don't think you need to make that much batter and flour though I only used barely a quarter of it and threw the rest out. I also used a bit of the frying oil for the gravy to give it more flavour.,,
1256574,187,2009-05-02,5,I just got done making this for dinner and it was delicious.  My husband said it reminded him of his Grandmother's.   Can't get much better then that!!!!  The gravy can definitely be used for biscuits and gravy.  I'll be making this again....soon.,,
1344980,187,2009-08-07,5,I can't even tell you how many times I have used this recipe! This is by far my favorite dinner to prepare for my family. I never hear any complaints from the other side of the table either! Thank you so much for posting a PERFECT recipe!,,
1349170,187,2009-09-01,5,"I would give this (6) stars if I could.  The addition of lager and the double-coating really made for a crispy steak, even after being smothered in the delicious, peppery gravy.",,
169460,187,2009-10-14,5,Very good.  My DH is from Texas and he said it's the best he's had since he left there many years ago.  Will keep and use again often.  Thanks for posting.,,
804978,187,2010-06-12,5,"Down home country cooking is what you have here, and it was so good!  Very satisfying and delicious!  The gravy was a great addition and added lots of flavor to the dish!",,
1381091,187,2010-07-13,5,Oh my this was so very good!!  Thank-You so much for the wonderful recipe.,,
804978,189,2010-06-12,5,"I can't understand why these haven't been reviewed!  They are delicious, and ones I plan to make a lot!  Make sure you don't overcook them.  Mine took about 18 minutes and were golden on top, and perfect in the middle.",,

7961,190,2001-05-14,0,"My only comment would be that it looks is if I should have kept out the 1st patch of  meat cooked and used the remainder to simmer for 2 hours because if I used all the meat I did not have anything to bring to a boil it was to dry.
just my thoughts.",,
10649,190,2001-12-11,3,"I agree with gay. Also too many ingredients makes a dish too complictated, I would say a few of the spices could have been left out. It had a nice flavour though!",,
177567,190,2005-08-23,5,We enjoyed this so much!!!  Did not find it greasy as we used the lean meat...we did add about 5 cups of tomatoe juice so it was jucier.  Loved the combination of spices!!,,
3652,191,2000-11-27,5,"Muffins were simply excellent!  Easy to prepare, moist and so tasty!  We started out by reducing the recipe for only 4 servings...after the first muffin was gone, we started the second batch (increasing to 12 servings!).  ENJOY!",,
3794,191,2000-12-15,5,"BOY!  You sure can't eat just one of these muffins at a time. They were really great and easy to make. I even made a terrible mistake, I forgot to put the brown sugar in. The next two batches I make I will do right. I didn't think something with green chili in would taste good. Was I surprised.",,
43505,191,2002-07-14,5,"These were very good - we ate them with Chili and they were gobbled up in no time.  Mine turned out more like biscuits than muffins, but they were great - I will make them again!",,
430205,191,2007-10-06,5,Mmm!  These were excellent!,,
95626,191,2009-01-06,5,"Whenever I make a zaar recipe, I poll the family during dinner, this was a unanimous ""5""! Made to go with turkey chili, I only got 9 muffins, they would have eaten all twelve though!",,
1073934,191,2009-09-28,5,"These were fabulious!  I have used many different corn muffin recipies and ended up with bland, blah muffins.  I am from NM so I LOVE to cook with hatch Green Chile.  I used fresh roasted green chile as opposed to the canned kind, and my kids do not like chiles, so I filled half of the muffin pan with the batter prior to adding the chiles.  The ones w/o chile were dry, but ok.  I think next time I will add a little corn to thier half.  Will absolutely make these again!",,
804978,191,2010-06-12,5,Wow these are excellent muffins.  Made to go with some chili I made up and it was a great combination of flavors.  Loved the addition of the chilies!,,
27381,192,2002-10-23,5,"Ah, my friends, this is the scone of my dreams. The perfect texture -  a nice combo of flaky yet sturdy. The dough is marvelous, the perfect ratio of dry and wet ingredients. It comes out easy to work with, not too sticky and a joy to knead. I'm so glad there is vanilla in the recipe, it made them smell heavenly while baking and the vanilla and raisin flavors are fabulous! My only recommendations are to be sure and knead the dough a bit after adding the raisins (in step 5) before patting on your board. Also, I only got 7 scones out of the dough and I used every bit of it. I give this recipe an A plus and 2 thumbs up! You gotta try it with stawberry preserves and Devon cream. The best! I'm uploading a picture, too.",,
126469,192,2004-02-23,5,Easy and Delicious!! I changed the recipe a touch by using 1 3/4 cup flour and about 1/2 cup oats because I like an oat texture to my scones. Also I added a little more cream because of the oat and they still came out perfect!!,,
140028,192,2004-06-07,5,Wow! This is the greatest scone recipe of all time! Thank you for posting it! The cream is definitely the key ingredient!,,
145599,192,2005-01-16,5,"These are really great! Very easy to make and the dough was really nice to work with. I like cheese scones so I added about 1 cup grated cheddar to my flour mixture.
I only got about 6 though. Any more and they're too thin. They are really tender and have a great crust.
My family ate the whole batch at once! Thanks for this recipe!",,
151679,192,2005-02-20,5,We all loved this recipe.  It is a great spring-board for additions and creativity.  I added chopped dried apricots and white chocolate chips.  Just YUMMY!!,,
67656,192,2005-05-03,5,"Wow these were good!!  They were quite easy to put together and though I'm certain I overworked the dough a bit, the scones were still tender and moist with a nice crispness on the shell. I added zest from one orange to the dough then split the dough in three. Made plain scones with one third; added dried cranberries to one-third; and, currants to the last third. Brought them into the office where they were quickly consumed by the crowd.  Even colleagues who ussually don't eat baked goods tried them and loved 'em. Thanks. ",,
268313,192,2006-03-15,0,Great scones! They didn't take that long to make either - I was an hour from when I started until we were eating them for breakfast!,,
143387,192,2006-03-18,5,Very light and tasty.  Added raisins to mine.  Forgot to brush the tops with egg and water mixture but they still came out lightly browned and delicious looking.,,
165263,192,2007-01-27,5,"These came out perfect. I served them with mock devonshire cream and raspberry jam.  I didn't use the raisons, but next time I will try with almond slivers.",,
527350,192,2014-11-13,5,"Absolutely delicious.  Great recipe.  I made two batches:  one with chocolate chips and the other with white chocolate chips, craisins, and slivered almonds.  Wonderful!",,
2000908127,192,2017-04-19,5,it is the best ever!!!! extremely delicious!! thank you.,,
1803311255,192,2014-11-08,5,So delicious! I admit I was skeptical from the dough (seemed heavy) but scones were light moist with a lovely flavor.,,
242809,192,2007-02-10,5,"YUM! This is a nice recipe for scones; one that I will always use! I actually substituted buttermilk for the heavy cream, and they came out super moist and fluffy. I also used dried blueberries, and whole wheat flour to make them healthier!  I'm looking forward to enjoying these for breakfast with a nice hot cuppa joe!! Thanks!!!",,
303545,192,2007-02-14,5,"I too used buttermilk, and 1 cup all purpose flour, while using 1 cup whole wheat flour.  They turned out fantastic, and I'm already wondering whether I should whip up another batch for mom!  Thanks Barbara for sharing!",,
188837,192,2007-03-05,5,"I used Heavy Cream and added white chocolate chips, cranberries and some slivered almonds - and these were amazing! Everyone loved them, and were surprised at the cake/cookie texture, as they look like biscuits!  Came together very easily too and could be altered for different ingredients!",,
91326,192,2007-12-03,4,"I've been experimenting with making this recipe in loaf form, so that it can be sliced and buttered.  Turns out quite well, with a rich, creamy sort of interior.  I had to add a fair amount of extra milk to get the dough to come together - maybe an extra quarter cup. To make this in a loaf pan, just press the dough into the pan gently, cook for about 15 minutes tented with foil, and then cook another 5 minutes without the foil.",,
680440,192,2007-12-08,5,"This recipe consistently yields tender and delicious scones. I have added cranberry/ white chocolate chips to one batch, and semi sweet chocolate chips to another. Both turned out delightful.",,
134289,192,2007-12-30,5,Great scone recipe!!  I added some whiskey soaked raisins and they turned out great.  I baked them for 13 minutes which was a bit too long.  Next time I will check them at 11 minutes.,,
624803,192,2008-03-20,5,"Wow... after trying three other scone recipes (one by a celebrity chef) this one blows them all away. I mixed in dried strawberries and cut them into heart shapes for a baby shower. They are the perfect blend of lightness, density and subtle sweetness. I used parchment paper rather than buttering a pan and they only needed to bake for 10 minutes to be golden brown. Superb!",,
862233,192,2008-06-15,5,"These scones are delicious! I have tried at least two other scone recipes (Betty Crocker and Joy of Cooking, I think--oh! and another from the Internet, so three) and this one is the best. I think it might be a little too sweet for my mom--she says they taste a bit like sugar cookies. This is definitely true. But they are so good with strawberry jam. I only wish I had clotted cream to put on them as well. I've got a batch in the kitchen ready to eat and am already excited for breakfast tomorrow morning! I made a double batch and got 29 total scones.",,
316717,192,2009-06-22,5,"i tried other's suggestions and threw in some dried cranberries, slivered almonds and white chocolate chips...it turned out awesome and so delicious. very moist inside. reminded my husband and i of a sweet biscuit. mine was ready in 11 minutes. can't wait to try many other variations! thanks for sharing! will go into our favorite file.",,
144490,192,2010-06-03,5,This recipe makes such a light and airy scone. They are delicious. I cut mine into triangles. I brushed them with some extra cream and baked them at 375 for about 18 minutes.,,
427184,192,2010-06-06,5,"Awesome recipe! I made these using  whole wheat flour, fructose, and skim milk... and they turned out fantastic! I used currents and baked at the suggested 425F for 24 minutes. Thank you!",,
843372,192,2010-06-12,5,We loved them!  They were the best I have had to date.  I added craisins and chopped pecans to mine instead of the raisins and they turned out great!,,
94740,192,2011-01-25,5,"This was my first time making scones.  Thank you for making it super easy!  We added semi-sweet chocolate chips, and they tasted like a cross between a flaky biscuit and a cookie.  I did substitute soy flour for about 1/3 of the flour, and they were ready after 12 minutes.",,
1537761,192,2011-05-14,5,These scones were fab! They literally melt-in-mouth! TERRIFIC!,,

1598863,192,2014-03-19,2,"These should be named, &quot;American Scones&quot;. Too much sugar! I grew up in a British home and my family owned a British bakery, so I had scones almost daily. These are just too sweet. I would definatly find a recipe with less sugar.",,

59911,196,2003-07-19,5,"This is a terrific backyard party.  We did this last year, and it turned out great.  This year we dug the pit in the same place, so the digging was much easier.

The flavor can be improved some by seasoning the bake.  I added a couple of green and red peppers, big branches of a parsley plant gone to seed, and stalks of celery.  Try wrapping these \",,
91724,197,2005-07-12,5,"I have not made this exact recipe but it is essentially the same as what is called ""boiled raisin cake"", which I have made, and it's delicious. When it first came out of the oven I thought I'd really done something wrong because it felt very, very firm to the touch and I thought it would be hard and dry. I let it sit for a day and it didn't seem any better, so I covered it with frosting and voila, the third day it was moist, dense and delicious, the kind of thing you can't resist taking a chunk of every time you pass the pan sitting on the counter. So the moral is to get it frosted right away and let it mellow for a day, then dig in. I used a vegan ""cream cheese ""frosting and it was delicious. The caramel frosting above sounds even better. Since shortening is baaaaad stuff, I used non-hydrogenated vegan margarine in the cake. You could also use canola oil. Great cake.",,
868654,197,2010-06-12,5,"Of course this has the texture of an old fashioned cake, because it is!  I added in some nuts just because we love them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The caramel frosting was the perfect touch to this fine cake!",,
142583,198,2004-12-02,5,Loved it!,,
176590,198,2004-11-27,5,"Very good recipe. I enjoyed the spiciness very much, as my family is used to eating very spicy Indian dishes. However, if you are not into extremely spicy foods, I suggest reducing the chili paste.

5067,198,2001-01-16,5,Great recipe for anyone who like it as close as it come to the real thing! Very simple to make and you can find all the ingredents in your local supermarket! I myself would cut back on the white pepper and add a little bit of hot oil (not to much)! I would also add about 1 1/2 tbls more of vineger. (or to taste) add a little more meat and you can serve with a bowl of white rice with steamed veggies for a meal of its own.,,
5227,198,2001-01-23,4,my family like the bamboo shoots whole. but we love your recipe,,
5519,198,2001-02-01,5,"My boyfriend and i were very pleased with this recipe. he is half chinese so he knows the good stuff. the only thing we changed was the amount of chili paste. we only put one tablespoon instead of 2. the soup is very very spicy with 2 tblsp's. other than that it was great. the flavor is awesome. my boyfriend said that it tasted just like his mom's. that is a great compliment.
amity",,
14613,198,2002-02-05,4,"this was pretty good on the whole. a few things: the cornstarch was waaay too much and it made the soup unbearably thick, less soupy and more mealie. i'll probably use just three tablespoons next time, perhaps less. the two tablespoons of chili sauce were also too much, just one would suffice. otherwise, the recipe is good. i omitted the pork and used less egg. i couldn't find black fungus so used dried wild mushrooms which worked out just fine. the soup is very filling and will have your scalp sweating by the time you're done.",,
29750,198,2002-02-16,5,"Excellent recipe, however I used only one egg & cut back on the corn starch. I've also used canned chinese stir-fry vegetables (bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, mushrooms & bean sprouts) & frozen shrimp in this soup for variation & ease.",,
15511,198,2002-04-23,5,"With a few adjustments this is the best I have ever made.  I've searched far and wide for a good recipe, and here it is.  I added two additional cups of broth.  Used 2 tablespoons of corn starch, two eggs, and a splash more vinegar.  I agree that using the two tablespoons of chili sauce makes it really really hot, but I like it that way.  Served it with sticky rice.  It was tremendous.  What a find.  Thanks for posting this recipe.",,
59721,198,2002-11-03,5,"This recipe is the bomb!  This is the closest to the restaurant kind that I've ever encountered.  It has a permanent home in my personal recipe box now.  As said in earlier posts, I would definitely only recommend using 1 Tbsp. of the chili sauce instead of 2 Tbsp.  Also, only 4 Tbsp. of the corn starch is needed.  Otherwise, it'll congeal pretty quickly.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone seeking ""the real thing.""",,
62086,198,2003-04-08,5,"I found this to be just great!  I cut the recipe in half, and I took some of the others' advice and reduced the cornstarch (for half the recipe I only used 1 Tbsp.

91201,198,2003-08-16,4,"Kick ass!  I love hot and sour soup and I could live on it!  This recipe is ""oooh la la."" 

Here's what I did different:  halfed the amount of garlic and chili paste (and that's saying a lot b/c I love me some HOT stuff), and halfed the amount of cornstarch.  I doubled the amount of soy, vinegar and sesame oil.  I also increased the egg and tofu amount a tiny bit (b/c I excluded the yolks in half the eggs I used and I love tofu).  USE YOUR OWN VARIATION AND ENJOY - IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!!",,
115553,198,2003-12-02,4,"With a few adjustments, this is about perfect.  Like others, I found 1 tbsp. of garlic and red chile paste provided plenty of punch and 2 tbsp. cornstarch was right.  I used 4 eggs, but next time I'll use two.  The vegetables can be varied at will.  I used Golden Needles, but no fungus and regular mushrooms instead of the straw.  We did not care for water chestnuts in the soup and I wouldn't use them next time.  And there WILL be a next time, because I am now done looking for the Hot and Sour Soup of my dreams.",,
121776,198,2004-01-13,5,"WOW!  This really IS the BEST!!!!  I took others advice, and only used 1 Tbsp. of the chili paste, and it was more than enough.  I don't like tofu, so I just used twice as much of the mushrooms.  If you're looking for the best, this is it!",,
50778,198,2004-01-31,5,Also loved this recipe.  Cut back on the eggs (used 3) and omitted pork and tofu.  Added a splash more vinegar an used reconstituted shiitake's.  Yum!  Perfect for killing a cold.,,
128909,198,2004-03-04,2,Way too hot!  Cut the chili paste dramatically if you don't want to burn your lips!  I ruined the whole batch by following the directions exactly.  I wish I had followed the other reviewers' advice!,,
145673,198,2004-06-15,5,I made this as it is listed.  I really enjoyed it and will make it again soon.,,
37106,198,2004-12-11,5,I apologize for taking so long to review this recipe as I have made this now at least 3 times. I did make some changes but only because we like our soup not quit as thick as what this recipe calls for. Therefore I used 4 tbs of cornstarch and 2 eggs. I did not think that the chili sauce needed to be adjusted. We all agreed that it had just the right amount of heat. My daughter enjoys this so much that she now fixes a big pot of it on the weekends (minus all the meat and veggies) and eats it for lunch through out the week. This is a prize recipe.,,
82161,198,2004-12-13,5,I just made this soup.........I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  It is soooo good!  I made it as stated in the recipe except I only put 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste.

And I've tried to make it from scratch several times unsuccessfully.  This recipe was easy and the ultimate Hot & Sour soup.  I will never look further for a recipe.  The changes I made were to use 1.5 tbsp of chili paste (I like spice but would reduce further if not used to it), 2 eggs and 3 tbsp of cornstarch, no pork, no straw mushrooms and substituted dried porcini mushrooms for the dried black fungus. Next time I'd try to find the dried black fungus and cut the water chestnuts into smaller pieces. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.",,

I also omitted the pork and water chestnuts. If I have more time, I like to add the black fungus, and tiger lily buds (golden needles).",,

That was just the right amount of heat for us. 1 rounded Tbsp. of cornstarch was perfect. Did use about 1/2 tsp. of pepper but will omit it next time. The bite was harsh. I will also omit the egg. I don't believe it adds to the flavor and the broth would be much more appealing to the eye without it. Did garnish with chopped Cilantro. It added a nice flavor and additional color.,,

Used more broth and less cornstarch.  Added cilantro, bean sprouts, half the chili paste, and used regular mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms.  Next time I think I will make it thicker and possibly add noodles in place of tofu.  My fiance is already begging me to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe Nancy!",,
232933,198,2007-12-27,5,"Nancy, this was a super recipe!  We made our Christmas Dinner this year an Asian theme.  (Each year we do something different, to make each year memorable).  This year was so successful.  My sons thought the soup was divine!  Everyone raved over it.  We did add the left-over pork filling from the egg rolls to it, as we did not want to waste anything.  It actually gave some additional texture and color, with the grated carrots.  We did not use 4 eggs, but cut that amount in half.  Also, we substituted the red chile paste with cayenne pepper.  All of it tasted better than any restaurant we have been to in the USA and abroad.  Thanks again for the great and  fairly quick recipe.",,

I left out the pork, eggs, carrot, water chestnut, and black fungus.  It was delicious.  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and did not find the soup thick at all.

Next time I'll try to find golden needles and black fungus, and then maybe open a Chinese restaurant!  

Thanks for a great recipe that I'll be sharing with family and friends!",,

I really like the restaurant version of hot & sour soup, and this had a little different taste, but VERY close! I think the ingredients that threw the flavor off was the mushrooms. I used canned shiitake & straw mushroom (only way I could find them) and was not impress with the flavor & texture it gave. Next attempt will be with fresh button mushrooms...which I've had at a couple Chinese restaurants. Thanks so much!!",,

Relying on some of the other reviews, I used only 1 tsp. of cornstarch and 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste, and when taste-testing it was not spicy enough (my family likes strong taste) so I ended up using 2 tbsp paste as the recipe said.  I also increased the soy to 3 tbsp and used 1/3 cup rice vinegar in place of 1/4 cup white vinegar.  I also used low-sodium soy sauce, which worked fine.  This was wonderful, flavorful and very authentic-tasting.  Thanks for a great recipe!",,

I followed this recipe exactly, omitting the water chestnut and carrots, but I still found it too bitter. I would back off on the vinegar but I can't think of any other way to improve this recipe. It was just plain awful! I will pay $1 for a cup of awesome authentic hot & sour at my local Chinese restaurant from now on.",,

The recipe has been passed out numerous times. It is the BEST hot and sour soup I have ever had and that includes in Chinese restaurants.  It is my go to recipe, period. 
We like it hot so I used 3 tablespoons of the garlic/chili sauce. I omitted the carrots and used 2 beaten eggs instead of the more healthy egg substitute. Regarding the cornstarch, I just keep adding the slurry until it looks to be the right consistency.  Everything else is as the recipe recommends....including the black fungus...or wood ear mushrooms. 
Thanks so much, Nancy.",,

I didn't see where it said to add the carrots so I put them in with the bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts.   I used 1 T  garlic red chili sauce, 1/4 c. egg substitute and only had button mushrooms and dried shitake and  also no tofu.   This is one dynamite hot and sour soup.  I can't wait until I have all the correct ingredients.  This is great as I made it though.",,

I used 2 eggs, all dried mushrooms which I hydrated, added both chicken and tofu. I was not thick from the corn starch or too salty or too tangy from the vinegar. It was a golden brown color and very appealing.  Super good on day 2 for lunch! It's a winner all the way around. Thanks for sharing Nancy!",,

I didn't know what to expect but I picked about 6 valencia oranges & 2 meyer lemons from my garden & went to town.  I didn't have the peppers on hand so I used 1 teaspoon each of ground chile arbol & ground new mexico medium heat chili.  It was still missing a little something so I tossed in about 3 tablespoons of chicken base as the sauce reduced.  Cooked for about an hour at 350, spooning a little of the sauce over the roast every 15 minutes & was very pleasantly surprised!  This was even better than Claim Jumper folks.  What little was left was saved for later, I was going to give the doggies a little treat as there wasn't much but my honeybunny barred the door and said he wanted to take it to work tomorrow.  It was that good.  Do try it, you'll like it!",,

I am wondering if the typeof plums used made any difference, The only thing i can think of is the skins on the plums maybe made the sauce more sour.

156951,232,2007-11-23,2,I am sorry but this did not turn out for me at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up with a super thick mixture of goo that I could barely get a spoon through.  I think if I had used a lot less flour it might have turned out better but as written it just did not work for me.,,
400708,232,2007-12-06,4,Loved this pie the flavor was just what I was looking for.  DH wanted a chocolate Meringue Pie and this fit the bill.  My only problem (and it's probably my technique as I'm new to this) was that it wasn't firm enough to hold it's shape when cut.  I'm thinking maybe I didn't cook it long enough but will be making this again and I'm sure perfection will come with practice.  That said the flavor of the rich chocolate can't be beat.  Thanks Carole for a wonderful recipe.,,
625864,232,2008-03-25,5,Chocolate lovers you gotta try this one!  This pie is so rich and chocolatey.  It more than satisfied my chocolate fix.,,
175727,232,2008-04-14,2,Just wasn't chocolatey enough for us ... It just wasn't as good as I anticipated.,,
526379,232,2008-11-27,5,"I loved this pie just as it is written because I prefer something denser that I can actually cut into a pretty slice (and my spoon still goes right through). But my husband preferred his grandmother's version (understandable), and she only uses a 1/3 cup of flour and does not bring it to a boil, just to the point of thickening. She also said that she forgot all about adding any salt. Hers tastes great, but it did not cut into actual slices.",,
340099,232,2009-05-08,5,I just wanted a good thick pudding to munch on for desert! I halved the recipe and my daughter and I devoured it. True to it's word this stuff is THICK! Yummy!,,
1052065,232,2009-06-30,5,I needed something chocolatey and didnt have any cream for silk pie so I decided to try something different and this recipe worked perfectly. I used Recipe #369244 and it was awesome. I got my fix. Thanks for posting Carole Reu!!,,
983634,232,2009-12-26,5,"This turned out really good and was a big hit with our resident chocolate lovers at Christmas dinner.  A couple notes: I made it the night before and left it in the fridge overnight. I used 4 egg yolks instead of 3 in the filling and 1% milk. The finished pie had a little bit of syrupy liquid in it. Apparently this is from the meringue and is completely normal, it did not change the taste of the pie at all. I also used a store bought graham cracker pie crust which worked just fine. It set almost immediately and cut into real slices. Great recipe.",,
730763,232,2010-06-13,5,"I didn't put the Meringue on top of the pie because we don't like it, but make it as a Chocolate Cream Pie...  We LOVED this pie!  Thick and rich chocolate.  Perfect with some Cool Whip on top... Yum!",,
636029,232,2012-04-19,3,"This didn't turn out good for me either, same as Katybird.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made sure to stir continuously using a wooden spoon in a non-stick pan on medium heat and I couldn't even let it come to a boil as it was thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan.  So I went ahead and put half into a bowl with the egg yolks stirred well return egg mixture to pan, still stirring continuously it was starting to smooth out but then before it could reach boiling point, it started thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan again and cramping my hand.  Please give me suggestions as to what may have caused this or how to prevent that from happening should I try and make it again in the future.  Thanks, Regina",,
1803309408,232,2014-11-12,5,The recipe has turned out great for me. The taste is chocolaty rich!!! First time at baking a chcolate pie without using a boxed pudding. Loved it. Easy to follow recipe too. Thank you.,,
2000452251,232,2015-10-29,4,The filling is good but my mirange didn&#039;t set up. I followed the instructions.,,
212874,232,2015-12-10,5,"My only problem with this recipe is that I now have to try really hard to not be a little snot when someone else makes a chocolate pie; I want to tell them their pie is alright but my new recipe is so much better. WOW!! 10 stars! I like pie, but I love this one, and it is now the pie I have to make for every event because it&#039;s just too good to pass up an opportunity to eat it. So rich and thick. Had no trouble getting it to set up. Very easy to make if you&#039;re handy with a whisk. I was careful to add the mixture to my yolks very gradually. And keeping my whites refrigerated seemed to help the meringue set up better. I&#039;ve made it with and without crust and love it both ways.",,

639848,236,2007-11-06,5,"I went to a Caribbean restaurant and I really enjoyed everything about the curry chicken except how spicy it was. I could not wait to recreate it.This was a really great recipe for my first time making curry chicken, I could not stop tasting the chicken.",,
744610,236,2008-04-03,5,"I quite like the flavor of the sauce and the scope for variety in this recipe; I usually deviate from the directions given. 
Instead of a whole chicken, I used three large chunks of breast meat, cubed.  Perhaps because of this, I found one large onion to be sufficient.  The onion/flour mixture seemed to soak up the 1 oz of butter, so I ended up adding another 5 Tbls...perhaps I added too much since I wasn't sure it was really 'paste'.  I'll try adding less next time. Instead of stock from the chicken, I used four cups of bullion.  Also, I added some broccoli with the chicken.
The end result is very nice over some brown rice. =)",,
730763,236,2010-06-13,5,"This is the perfect Chicken Curry for us as we don't like things TOO spicy.  It went over big with my two kids too, so it is now in my favorites for when we want to have it again!",,
4470,238,2009-06-30,5,Lovely peppy spices than enhance the flavor of the livers.  I was generous with the peri-peri because I love spice.  I added some mushrooms to the onions - Dinner was enjoyed by all,,
744898,238,2010-06-14,5,Very very good using chicken livers.  A nice change from just sauteeing them in butter!,,
2000129315,238,2015-05-06,5,"Delicious - even my kids loved it. I used mirin for the wine, and only used the chicken livers. I didn&#039;t have the peri-peri (not sure what that is) but it didn&#039;t seem to lack anything. A sweet savory flavor that would also make a wonderful pate if pureed.",,
29782,240,2005-12-13,5,"This was delicious! 
I used white wine vinegar cause I didn't have any rice wine vinegar, it worked fine and I added some sesame oil to give it more flavor. We loved it! Thanks for sharing the recipe! ",,
60989,240,2007-03-01,4,Good and easy. I liked the addition of the rice wine vinegar. I used olive oil cooking spray instead of vegetable oil to cut down on the fat. Thanks!,,

521933,240,2007-06-21,4,A very simple and quick weeknight meal. Not to mention CHEAP! We all added a bit more soy sauce and I added some pepper. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks!,,
609323,240,2008-09-04,5,"Wow!  This is great.  I made it without the meat, but I was surprised at how well the rice wine vinegar worked with the dish.  I would have never thought to try it.  I also scrambled two eggs into it for that ""comfort feel"" from my childhood.",,
65573,240,2010-01-07,4,"great basic recipe! we used leftover chicken, and brown rice. very yummy!",,
730763,240,2010-06-13,5,I drizzled in some egg substitute for the heck of it.  I liked the addition of the rice wine vinegar.  It gave it more flavor then with just the soy sauce.  I will make it again as both my kids liked it too!,,
1392349,240,2010-06-28,5,"This was the second time I made this dish.  It is great!  My boyfriend is a picky eater, and he rated this 5 stars, too.  I added some frozen mixed veggies in addition to the peas for more color, and used more soy sauce then suggested.  I will be making this frequently.",,
722185,240,2011-02-21,0,We LOVE this recipe...kids just eat it up and adults do too. The only thing I do differently besides take out the peppers is cook the rice with chicken broth instead of water. Thanks for sharing!!!,,

I used all whole-wheat pastry flour, 1/4 cup canola oil, 3 tsp baking soda, milk, 1 cup chopped fresh cherries, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup pecans and a little shy of 1/2 cup sugar.  I wanted to use some of the other  options- like cornmeal or oatmeal or use something else for the milk, but their cupbords are pretty bare compared to mine so I'll have to wait til I get home!!

Additions were 3/4 cup grated carrots, 3/4 cup banana, and 1 tsp cinnamon. Also, used 1 TB baking powder instead of 2 tsp (as suggested). I used 3 TB ground flaxseed and only 1 TB canola oil. Oh and no sugar, just 1.5 tsp sweet n low. And used NF dry milk and water instead of regular milk - probably about 1.5 cups - one cup just wasn't nearly enough. The muffins are great - rose very nicely. I make muffins pretty often - nice when bread is running low and to use up fruit (like bananas) that are starting to go.

I simply incorporated them while I was adding the sugar.  It seemed to work just fine.  I played with my red and green food colouring.  Instead of adding them and mixing well, I only swirled them in.  This gave it the look of peppermints.  The cooking time was right on for me.  It worked out to 4 small cookie sheets of ""kisses"" for me.  I think it would probably be about 24-30 kisses.  It was hard to count as they were being snatched up before I could even get the rest out of the oven.  This is a keeper.

The tangy/sour flavor from the cream cheese,sour cream and lemon juice was certainly overpowering the whole dip. It needed something with a spicy taste, I think, to balance the flavor. Also, The cheese I had melted on top(cheddar) had a layer of oil from cooking.After it had cooled a little the whole top layer of cheese came off in one piece. Maybe next time (if I remake it)I will mix all the cheese in to the main mix. Other than those small flaws it was edible and the flavor of the crab meat really came through.",,

109055,246,2007-01-03,4,"I made this dip for New Year's Eve.  Added some old bay, onion powder, pepper, and extra worcestershire sauce to give it a little punch.  I used about 3/4 lb. of fresh backfin crabmeat.

I didn't like it hot!  Right out of the oven, it seemed bland.  HOWEVER, after sitting in the refrigerator overnight, I decided to spread it on club crackers just because I didn't want to waste it.  Oh how wonderful it is as a cold spread!!!   I ate the whole thing in two days time!!  Who knows, maybe slightly heating it at this point, with the flavors all mingled, it might be good hot.  I will remember this as a wonderful cold spread!",,
397927,246,2007-07-16,5,"Love this, and have made it several times.",,
251694,246,2007-09-26,5,I absolutely loved this recipe. I added some finely chopped green onions and used fresh pressed garlic.  The worcestershire sauce added a wonderful flavor for this delicious dip.  I made it twice this weekend and it was gone within 30 minutes after it came out of the oven!  THank you so much for posting this!,,
253988,246,2007-10-14,5,This was amazing.  My DH and I had this for dinner a few nights ago.  We ended up eating it only and the entire bowl!!  He couldn't stop talking about how great and creamy it was.  I am doubling the recipe and taking it to a birthday/ football party today.  GO COLTS!,,
666014,246,2007-11-30,5,Yummy! We made this with french bread and ate the whole thing!,,
444534,246,2007-12-21,5,Mt husband loved this recipe! I doubled the recipe which turned out fine. It also re-heated well the next day. Next time I will use bread for dipping.,,
478964,246,2007-12-24,5,"Great, I added green onions and used pepperjack cheese to make it spicier.",,
140132,246,2007-12-30,5,This is sooooo good.  Very rich but so delicious.  We made this for Christmas Eve and it was gone in no time.  I will be making this many times over.  Thank you for this yummy recipe.....Stephanie,,
587965,246,2008-01-06,5,"This was a total hit at my new years eve party.  I only bought enough stuff to make one and could have bought enough for three. This was the first to go.  Thanks, this will be added to my appetizer recipes.",,
82737,246,2008-01-06,5,"This was GREAT!!! Even dear old Dad
(who hates dips) said he could make a meal of this.  The only thing I did different was to use a little fresh garlic and fresh lime juice (didn't have lemon on hand).  Thanks of a wonderful appy recipe!",,
720932,246,2008-01-15,5,I loved this dish. My dear old dad found it on here and made it for my boyfriend and I for supper. It was so delicious! Dad likes it better the next day after it has chilled in the refrigerator over night and all of the flavors have blended. Served hot or cold its a hit!,,
796596,246,2008-05-10,5,I prepared this dip ahead of time and baked it while everyone was in the kitchen enjoying all the snacks at my party. Soon the whole place smelled wonderful and they ate it right up and couldn't stop raving about it! Thanks for the great recipe!,,
897900,246,2008-08-25,1,What a waste of crab!  Way too tangy flavor that drowns out the crab. Yuch!,,
56353,246,2008-09-21,5,I made this for my family during the Superbowl. They loved it and it was a festive addition to the usual snacks. We had leftovers and it was just as yummy cold. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making it again.,,
416292,246,2008-09-29,5,"Made this for a baby shower and it was a HUGE HIT! I didn't have worcester sauce so I used a couple dashes of soy sauce, also I didn't mely cheese on the top, but I did mix it all in and it turned out wonderful! It was one of the first things to go.",,
11176,246,2009-04-06,5,"Oh, MYmymymymymymy..... This could become a VERY dangerous addiction! I made this for my husband and his friends who stopped by yesterday and they couldn't shut up about it. ;)  I took my portion to the living room where I could feast upon it in peace and make barely-subdued moaning noises and euphoric facial expressions without being gossiped about later. Anyway, I used backfin crab and it seemed a little fishy, so next time I'll go for higher quality. I used a pre-shredded cheddar and for the milk, used 1/2 and 1/2. Everything else I did as indicated. The combination of ingredients was just wonderful and I can't wait to make this again.  Thank you to Lee and crabplace.com!",,
485728,246,2009-05-05,5,"This is very tasty.  It tastes great right out of the oven, but the leftovers were even better the next day after being warmed up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!",,
779874,246,2009-06-14,5,"A quintessential party dip - creamy, cheesy, and crabby! I used backfin crab meat in mine. Such a snap to prepare and everyone loved it.",,
34357,246,2009-08-18,4,"This was very good. Mine didn't set up very well until after it had cooled. However, nobody seemed to mind because it tasted great!",,
533122,246,2010-01-10,4,"A nice basic recipe for warm crab dip. We added some chopped artichokes and served with whole wheat crackers. I wish I had added some Old Bay, it would have added a nice kick. I did add a few drops of Tabasco sauce. Yummy!",,
741522,246,2010-02-18,4,"Fantastic and easy!  I added Old Bay and substituted fresh grated Asiago cheese, then used low fat mayo, sour cream, and cream cheese.  I will definitely make this again!",,
709542,246,2010-06-14,5,Great tasting dip!  My DW whipped it up and we just about fell into the dish fighting to get there first!  Served it with some rippled potato chips and bagel chips.  It's a real treat for us!,,
1489025,246,2011-01-02,5,Great recipe. I got this recipe from an old freind from Maryland back in the early eighties. Her husband was a crabber and knew what tasted good. Still a great tasting dip!,,
43083,246,2011-08-28,4,"This was delicious and super simple to make. However, I felt like it was missing something. Maybe I'll add some Old Bay next time. Thanks for sharing.",,
531256,246,2012-09-09,3,"With all these great reviews I hate to be the one who has something negative to say, but my family and I didn't really care for this recipe as written.  I doubled the recipe, and didn't use the cheddar cheese, that was the only change I made, and we all thought it was very bland.  Before baking, I added a lot of old bay (maybe a ts or 2) and hot sauce (maybe 3 or 4 Tb) and we finially liked it.  I mixed it up the day before, and baked it covered for an hour, then uncovered for 20 minutes, with a little old bay sprinkled on top.  After those changes it was fantastic.  Thanks for posting anyway, I doubt I'll ever make crab dip any other way.",,
1462591,246,2016-08-19,5,"This has been my go-to recipe for the past 6+ years! It's the perfect accompaniment to crab...not too overpowering. Good bread is necessary! The only two additions I make are 2 tbsp grated onion mixed in with everything else and a sprinkling of Old Bay (or J.O.'s) on the top before baking. NOTE: If you pick the crabs yourself and they have been steamed in Old Bay, DO NOT add the old bay or garlic salt or it gets WAY TOO SALTY!) If you want to freeze to save for another night, be sure to bake it but not for the whole time—closer to 20/25 mins—then you can reheat in the microwave or toaster. If you don't cook it it ends up separating. I usually split the recipe and have half that night and half the next weekend. Enjoy!",,
526250,246,2018-02-03,5,I made a slight variation on this that turned out amazing. I added diced red peppers and green onion I then drizzled it with cocktail sauce ... I was told it was BANGING... Great recipe Thanks,,
664832,247,2017-10-26,5,"This turned out beautifully. I just used whole wheat bread but followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful. I didn’t toast the underside of my bread so it was a little soft so next time will toast first, turn it over and then add garlic and oil and toast again.",,
3810,249,2000-12-18,4,"These were incredibly easy and fast to make.  They stored well in the refrigerator...I brought them to my organization's holiday potluck on a nice paper plate.  They all went quickly, so there was no cleanup or any leftovers to take back home.  PS--my coworkers liked them!",,
8936,249,2001-05-01,4,this was a great recipe. You can also substitute the pita bread with a soft tortilla wrap or even just crackers.   Also you can substitute the lemon-pepper with garlic pepper.,,
9206,249,2003-03-17,5,Loved this recipe made it for thanksgiving/baby shower get together and the family made sure there was none left i'm glad i sampled some before we got to the party.,,
151660,249,2004-07-11,5,"These are excellent and very easy to make.  My family loves them, I can never make enough of them.",,
447921,249,2007-05-08,2,"I didn't particularly like the chemical aftertaste of the packaged salad dressing mix or the prepared lemon-pepper seasoning. It's a good concept, though and I will probably play with the idea and my own natural seasonings.",,
1214520,249,2009-03-24,5,"This is a favorite for my family as well as for parties, I take this to all of my functions and people go crazy.  I even just took it to a girl scout meeting and the girl scouts ate it all up.  I have even substituted ranch dressing mix for the Italian and it worked out wonderfully.",,
709542,249,2010-06-14,5,I used half a package of the dry dip mix and it was plenty for us.  We loved these little sandwiches and will enjoy them again!,,
84361,251,2003-12-18,3,"Good basic thai proportions. I used water chestnuts instead of bean sprouts, because I had them on hand. I'll be saving this for future reference.",,
186981,251,2005-08-10,3,"I served this as part of a Thai dinner for friends.  We all agreed that it left a bit to be desired.  It wasn't bad, not at all.  It just didn't ""WOW!"" any of us.  Being unfamiliar with Thai cooking, part of the problem may lie with me.  I did not know for how long to soak my mushrooms, so they may not have soaked long enough before I had to add them to the dish.  At this time, the recipe does not indicate how much or what type of oil to use for cooking the shallots and garlic.  I started with sesame oil and then re-cooked shallots in vegetable oil and combined the two oils when I tossed and coated the noodles.  I still don't think I had enough oil to properly coat the noodles, and by this time it was too late to try and flavor my third round of oil, as my meat was all cooked and waiting for my noodles to be added.  I might try this again and see if I can make any improvement on my technique.",,
174991,252,2008-02-10,3,This is a different tasting sauce.  I used it over vegetables and it overpowered them.  This was the first time using sorrel so I'm not sure if it is getting used to the taste.  I will make it again and give it another try.,,
58104,252,2010-05-04,5,"I found this quite fascinating! Full of vibrant, fresh flavors. I did use both arugula and sorrel along with the rest of the the ingredients. I did make 1/2 the recipe. I didn`t use salt no need! I serve this over grilled asparagus and grilled ramps. Thanks!",,
69838,256,2005-03-24,4,"Okay.  These bars were delicious, but I did have a few issues.  1) I had a hard time getting the amount of dough to stretch through the pan. It worked, but I think maybe a bit more dough would have been helpful.  2) there definitely was not enough preserves (at least not in my opinion).  I used about 4 more ounces of preserves in order to get a nice layer over the bars.  I did feel as though there was a bit too much meringue, so I left off just a tad bit of it.  Overall, this recipe is fantastic, and they make for fabulous crowd pleasers.  I finished these minutes before my guests arrived, and they were gone before I knew it... They didnt even give me a chance to photograph these lovely little finger-food delights...  Next time! Because there WILL be a next time.  These were thoroughly enjoyed.  (But next time I may leave the nuts off! :) )",,
56112,256,2005-03-27,5,"These were fantastic.  I was like L4C, the dough is very stiff and takes some work getting it to stretch for the entire pan, but it did and it turned out fine.  I did use strawberry preserves, because that is what I had on hand, and I also used a bit more than called for.  This is a very rich dessert.  I will be making it again, but I think next time, I may cut the sugar for the meringue in half.",,
111277,261,2003-11-06,5,Excellent soup and so very easy to make. I used regular shredded cheddar and the recipe said sharp cheddar. The next time i will use the sharp. I would certainly not make any other changes. ,,
118417,261,2003-12-22,5,Excellent flavor!  Easy to make!  Most people (my mother included) said it was the best crab bisque they ever ate!,,

515663,261,2007-09-13,5,I love this recipe! The only thing different I do is add a can of condensed tomato soup. My family loves this.,,
193804,261,2008-01-01,5,"My family loved this soup! I didn't have sherry, so I omitted it, and I substituted fat-free evaporated milk for the whipping cream. I used Eatzi's seafood rub for the seasoning. The result was very smooth and creamy, with a slightly sweet undertone. Delicious!",,
256155,261,2008-01-03,4,"This tasty, creamy soup made for a decadent first meal of the new year.  Excellent recipe!  This is one of our new favorites.",,
601098,261,2008-01-29,5,The perfect soup. My whole family loved it. I had to triple the batch the second time I made it so people could have more. When I serve it I sprinkle just a little bit more cheese on the top with the parsley.,,
293971,261,2008-06-19,5,"I made this last night before going to work and put it in the crock pot to keep warm,  When I got home at 1 AM my husband and son were still talking about it!!  I used pasturized crab by Phillips in a can, and didn't have sherry or lemon pepper but they didn't seem to mind a bit!  Thanks for sharing a great bisque recipe!!",,
27876,261,2008-08-04,5,"Yum! Made it tonight for dinner, and we LOVED it!  I used fat free, evaporated milk, instead of whipping cream (as another reviewer suggested), as the soup was still creamy, hearty and delicious.  I had no parsley, so I omitted it.  I used Old Bay seasoning, lemon pepper, and salt to season, but felt something was missing so I added a good tablespoon or two, of Emerils original seasoning.  That did the trick.  If you don't have Emeril's, I think a good spice mix of garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, paprika and extra salt will give it an extra kick that puts it over the top.  I served it hot with some extra shredded cheddar over the top.  I will definitely be making this to impress at my next dinner party!",,
599741,261,2008-12-25,5,"Absolutely stellar.  Added 1 1/2 T. Essence and omitted lemon pepper.  Made the entire soup, minus crabmeat, the day before.  All I had to do was add crab and heat.  Decadent and marvelous.",,
959262,261,2009-11-05,5,"Great bisque!!!
My wife is lactose intolerant so I made some adjustments and added a couple goodies to fill in the sauce. I used 1.5c milk, 2.5c chicken broth and omitted the whipping cream and sherry. I sauteed 1/2c fine chopped onions in the butter, added 1c cooked, diced potatos (red) and 1c white corn to the finished sauce. There were no complaints or leftovers!  What a treat!!!",,
1448689,261,2010-02-12,5,"So yummy! I make this all the time but i lighten it up a bit. I use Fat free milk, fat free half and half, and  2% sharp cheddar and it comes out amazing! I also added a potato to make it more"" chowder-like"". But over all Awesome recipe! Company loves it too!!",,
626447,261,2010-06-17,5,This is excellently flavored!  It was a great appetizer to a special dinner I prepared for company.  I too added in some potatoes just because. Rich and delicious and loaded with crab!,,
2215586,261,2012-03-19,3,"Looks like I may be the only one who isn't blown away by this recipe.  I tried it because it looked simple.  Indeed, the end result did not quite taste like the crab bisque I usually have in restaurants.  The only thing that made it taste like crab bisque was the sherry. I feel that it lacks something but still have not quite found out what it is lacking.  I won't be trying this again.",,
1448548,262,2010-02-20,0,"Fabulous! I made thisrecipe with a can of Jumbo lump crab meat and it was terrific. I added some chopped Jalepenos for a little kick. Will definately make again.
   Z. Holman",,
56181,266,2004-07-20,4,"These were very easy to make and very tasty!  The only change I made was to halve the recipe and add a little sour cream (about 1/8 cup) to the potato mixture.  The skins weren't as good as with regular potatoes in the oven, but because of how easy these were, I will definitely be making them again!  Thanks for posting!",,
252955,266,2005-10-20,4,I really liked the easiness of this recipe.  I substituted the bacon for chicken and halved the recipe.  Yum,,
133174,266,2010-05-17,5,I really enjoy twice baked potatoes but the traditional method takes such a long time.  This is quick and so easy.  I used fresh chives in place of the green onion and added in some Greek yogurt for a portion of the milk.,,
626447,266,2010-06-17,3,"Easy, but as usual when made in the microwave, not as good as in the oven.  The skins of the potatoes were tough and the potatoes were overdone cooking them as long as you said.  I guess it depends on the wattage of your microwave, because the times here were way too long, resulting in a not so great tasting baked potato as posted,",,
1889798,266,2011-04-20,4,The only thing I did differently was to finish the potatoes in the oven. It only take about 10 minutes for the second baking and it makes them almost as good as using the oven the whole time.,,
2851376,266,2013-08-25,5,"A great dinnertime solution, I&#039;ll be adding this to my rotation of regular meals that I make frequently!  I feed picky eaters, and this is a recipe that will consistently make everyone happy with a minimum of fuss and effort.  This recipe is so much simpler in the microwave and nobody could tell that I had &quot;cheated&#039;.  Although - just to take note - just because it is the microwave doesn&#039;t mean it doesn&#039;t take time.  There are many things to microwave in several different sessions, and microwaving potatoes takes some time.",,
86318,270,2003-10-03,5,"This is a nice change from apple butter. I made 1/3 of the recipe, getting 1 cup of pear butter, so I think the full recipe will yield 1 1/2 pints. I caught my husband snacking on it when it was still cooling on the kitchen table, so I don't think it will last long. Thank you for the recipe, 1Steve",,
52062,270,2003-10-13,5,"Very yummy!  I've made plain pear butter (with orange juice, peel, and nutmeg) and this spiced kind.  The flavor is delicious!  Much more interesting and elegant.  It will make good gifts.  I got a bit over 9 half-pints.  I didn't peel and core my pears, I just removed the stem and blossom end, cooked, and put through a sieve.  I think this gave me more pulp than if you peel and core them.  I also used apple cider instead of the apple juice.  My end product is a medium brown color.  Thanks for a great recipe!",,
159031,270,2004-08-22,5,"This is Wonderful!!!  I made two batches of it.  The first one just like the recipe reads, and it is delicious.  The second batch, I left 1/3 of the pears chopped and pureed the rest.  I combined them just  before canning them.  That way the butter had fruit chunks in it.  It was great both ways.  This is definately my favorite canning recipe.  I couldn\'t believe how wonderful my kitchen smelled with the fresh herbs simmering away.  I even saved the juice stock, strained it, and added a little sugar.  Made a wonderful spiced pear drink.",,
145219,270,2004-08-28,4,I made this without coring or peeling like Frau Frau suggested. I also made 2/3 of the recipe. After cooling it was rather runny so I boiled it all up again for another 20 mins. Result - 1 pint of delicious pear butter. Rather sweet...perhaps some lemon juice might be a good addition next time? We all love it though...,,
50002,270,2006-10-01,5,"This was GREAT! Super easy. Although, I had to stir it more than ""frequently"" as it splattered so much while cooking if I didn't.

I used 12.5 pounds, coarsely chopped, and a huge kettle, just trimming out cores, stems, and blossom ends. I used the chinois sieve and also made drinks from the extra liquid I drained off. I used 6 cinn. stix, 4 1/2 cu. apple juice, 6 minced slices of gingerroot, 12 whole cloves and 5 1/2 cu. sugar. I put pulp thru a wire strainer also. No gritty things ! It took 35 minutes longer for each step. An hour to thicken and it is heavenly in 7 pints. Use wide mouth so you can get every last bit. Yum.",,
956686,270,2008-09-24,0,GREAT recipe.  Didn't have quite enough pears so I used 6 apples.  Also I added 1/4 tsp of orange peel.  I only used 1.5 cups sugar.  I coulod have cooked it down a little longer to make it thinner but the flavor is incredible,,
938649,270,2010-09-14,5,"I had never made pear or apple butter before and this saved me when my brother showed up on my doorstep with 40lbs of fresh pears!!! It was delicious! A bit heavy on the sweet so next time I will use maybe 1/2 the sugar or no sugar, as I tend to use over-ripe fruit just for the natural sweet! It helped a ton to have access to a gas burner for this recipe! If your kitchen doesn't have gas think about your gas BBQ, worked wonders for us!! Thanks for posting this!",,

I did keep basting it over the two hours.  I did not have any curry powder so used green thai curry paste.  My husband who normally piles heaps of mint sauce on the lamb did not use it on this recipe once he had tasted it.  Very easy and yum.",,
107504,271,2006-09-29,5,"This is a simple, quick and tasty dish to prepare.  Lemon and curry worked well with the lamb chops.  May even try to substitute the lemon with lime as this becomes a regular favourite.",,
111075,271,2007-03-25,5,"I served these chops with fruit chutney and they were gone in seconds with everyone demanding more!  This will be a regular menu item in our home.  Thanks, Doreen, for an excellent recipe.",,
559355,271,2007-11-05,5,simple yet delicious.  I used pork chop since there were no lamb chops.,,

394085,271,2009-08-20,5,Outstanding!  I used shoulder chops and the flavor is out of this world.  I look forward to making these again...and may try with pork chops too.,,
296050,271,2010-04-27,5,Excellent recipe - very easy to prepare as well.  Instead of pan frying after marinading I made a foil tent for the lamb and poured the marinade over the lamb then baked in a 350 oven for about 1 1/2 hours - excellent flavor.  Poured the sauce over the lamb and the lemon rice side I prepared.  Will be using this recipe as a regular for our lamb chops.  Thanks for posting.,,
1500265,271,2010-05-24,5,Excellent recipe. It is very easy.  I used less salt without any negative affect and instead of using butter and sauteing the lamb we used butter spray and used our stovetop grill pan.  My brilliant husband (he wanted me to make sure and put that part) put pieces of pineapple on the grill as well and it took up some of the flavors of the meat.  All were delicious.  Thanks for the recipe! We'll use it again - for company!,,
2001392766,271,2017-02-15,5,"I hate when people start with &quot;I used this instead of...&quot; But I didn't have enough lemon juice. The lamb chops were small, and I had about 2/3 the amount of lemon required. I just used 2/3 the other ingredients too. I also had some preserved lemons. I took 1/4 of a preserved lemon and squeezed it into the marinade. I also added about 2T of nice olive oil and marinated all day. (I used Madras Curry powder) I also seasoned with black pepper before frying I used olive oil and butter to fry the chops. I served with lemon rice and asparagus with lemon zest, oil oil, garlic, and kosher salt roasted in the oven at 400 degrees about 7 minutes. Amazing flavor! Thank you!",,
68960,272,2005-04-14,4,Very tasty! I actually used slightly more fresh mint. Went lovely over our lamb chops. Served with mashed potatoes. Thanks Doreen! (You are from my home town!),,
186979,272,2010-04-04,5,"I grew up eating lamb so I obviously enjoy it. For Easter dinner 2010, I had gorgeous lamb chops that I wanted as the stars of dinner, with just a hint of sauce so they weren't over-whelmed by flavour. This sauce fit the bill perfectly! The lemon is a nice addition to the usual mint sauce that is dumped onto lamb; this was light, flavourful and had a nice combo of sweet & savory. Every one of our guests at Easter raved about this sauce!",,

We started with fresh spinach, so we added them to the onion together with the garlic and cooked them for a few minutes, until done. Then we let the mixture cool, salted it a little bit, but not too much since we  used 2/3 cup goat milk feta and added about 3 tbsp grated pecorino romano in step 2. We also used more  garlic (6 cloves, finely chopped)and shrimps (9 ounces frozen, then thawed a steamed and cut them into 1/2"" pieces) and added a lightly beaten egg to the filling (even though I'm not sure it's essential ; I just did it because I usually do when I make spanakopita). And we made this into a pie ( in a 9"" pie dish), using 4 lightly buttered phyllo sheets for the bottom a 3 sheets for the top. Only 2 tbsp butter were needed for brushing the dough sheets.

I found the phyllo dough web site to be of great help  www.athens.com  with folding the triangles.  Recipezaar had the better idea of cutting the 2"" strips before unrolling, though.

It's tasteless without a lot of salt.  My DH thought it was okay.  I did change the recipe a little, though, to make it a bit easier. 1) To shorten the amount of cooking time, I pricked each potato a few times with a fork, and then microwaved them between two moist paper towels for about 6-8 minutes, or until starting to get soft.  I cut them into chunks (using a pot holder, of course).  I always leave the skin on as it doesn't take away from the taste and does add a little nutrition.  2) I didn't clean the pan between cooking the potatoes and onions and cooking it with the eggs and I had no problem.  I did add about 2 Tbsp. of oil first, though.  3) I added about 1 1/2 - 2 tsp. of salt.  4) I added some sliced scallions/green onions for color.  5) I cooked the omelet on high and waited a few minutes so that I only had to cook each side once.",,
299531,280,2007-02-13,5,this is exactly the way that my spanish friends taught me to make this. great recipe. make sure people realize that the high fat count is a bit lower because you drain off most of the oil after the potatoes are cooked.,,

265954,280,2007-07-09,5,"I've made this many, many times.  It's delicious, but I do not think you need to add the potato slices one by one to avoid sticking.  Just drop the potato slices into the skillet and stir often to prevent burning and sticking.  I've also changed this recipe up a bit by adding half a chopped Cubanelle/Italian pepper, or by adding chorizo or by adding sliced green olives.  Very authentic dish from Spain and simple to make.  Thanks for posting!",,
557801,280,2007-08-20,5,"I've made a very similar recipe from an authentic source in the high school Spanish classes that I teach.  Tips:  First, just use ordinary olive oil, not an extra virgin, as if won't be able to take the heat.  To avoid crispy potatoes, be sure the oil is at the right temperature (potatoes should cook slowly when dropped in, and shouldn't sound like french fries in a deep frier) and that potatoes are sliced equally thin (my students do this with a mandoline).  My recipe also includes some garlic, which we crush and sautee with the onions in a separate pan just to make things easier (and to give another student a job to do).  The potatoes should NOT be stireed, as they tend to break up and release more starch this way.  One at a time (employ the assistance of another pair of hands to speed this up if you're not cooking alone) is the best way to go.  Keep in mind, you want evenly tender, cooked potatoes.  No browning.  These aren't french fries!  I'm not sure 1 cup of oil is enough.  We don't usually measure, just fill a skillet almost 1/2 full with olive oil, heat, and then put in potatoes as long as they are all covered , so you don't have to stir.  One reviewer mentioned needing a lot of salt.  I had this problem the first time I made it in class as well.  I had skipped a step in my recipe, which recommends salting the potatoes before cooking, along with seasoning the egg with a little salt and pepper.  This really helps a lot, as salting afterwards just doesn't seem to do it.  The salt doesn't penetrate, and you end up with a really salty outside & lack of flavor inside.  If done correctly, the tortilla should only be flipped once.  High heat when you first drop the egg mixture into the pan is important, as in the original recipe.  This helps to avoid sticking.  However, I don't know that I'd go all the way to the smoking point.  Do reduce the heat and allow to cook slowly right after putting the eggs and potatoes into the pan.  Frequent shaking really isn't necessary.  Just run a rubber scraper around the edge and give it a good shake to loosen before you do the famous ""flip.""  When the outside edges start to look dry and only the middle looks slightly runny, it's about time to flip.  I'm generally not a big fan of browned eggs, but in this dish, it's necessary and normal for the outside to brown, and no, it doesn't taste like an overcooked dry omlette.  This is totally different!  Yes, you can do the flip!  The first time I did it was in front of 20 teenagers, and I managed it!  The method in the recipe works well, but as you slide back into the pan, have a rubber scraper ready to tuck any potatoes that try to escape back into the eggs.  In Spain, this is served cut into wedges, either hot or cold, and yes, often in sandwiches.  I had never had leftovers to sample cold until this past semester, and WOW, is that good!  The most amazing part of this dish is that I always have students who don't like one or more of the ingredients, but somehow, the combination of all of them ends up creating something that appeals to nearly everyone.  I've only come across one high school student who did not like the dish, and everyone at least tries it.  (They're teenagers, they can't NOT try it!)  We didn't do anything other than pour excess oil out of the pan in between steps, there was no need to clean the pan.  The oil from frying the potatoes can be poured back into the bottle when cooled and stored in the refrigerator for future frying uses.  It will solidify in the refrigerator, but don't be alarmed.  It's still useable and will return to liquid form at room temperature.  Enjoy your tortilla espanola!  It IS a lot of work, but the flavor is worth the effort!  This is the minimalist, traditional recipe.  Once you master it, have fun with it and add whatever you want.  I won't tell the Spaniards you aren't making it the 'traditional' and 'authentic' way!  :)",,
529022,280,2008-08-14,5,"I made this tortilla today for the lab I work for and everybody liked it. I added 2 crushed garlics to the onions and potatoes to give it a little extra flavor. I also used a 10 inch pan with vertical walls so it could have better volume and shape. Therefore, I used 6 jumbo eggs instead of 4. I spent one semester in spain and this definitely is the real thing or really close to it. But as always every taste is different and you are allowed to change ingredients, times and utensils to be as creative as you can become. Thanks a lot kenk!",,

It has become favorite of ours too. Thank all the reviewers with their helpful hints. The hardest part is peeling the potatoes.  Thank you ""kenk"" for posting this recipe",,
978369,280,2008-12-30,4,"This is one of my favorite foods.  Kenk's is a very traditional recipe and not unlike mine.  However, I do a few things differently.  I have found that coarsely grating my potatoes helps make the tortillas more stable during and after cooking.  I start my onions cooking while I'm grating the potatoes and I cook them in about 3T of olive oil.  I use almost as much onion as potato but I don't add garlic because it damages the delicate flavor of the tortilla and isn't as good cold.  The egg to potato ratio is very important.  Basically the egg mixture should easily cover the potatoes when you mix them together.  After you stir the potatoes into the eggs be sure to let them sit for 5 minutes before you pour them into the hot pan to form tortillas.  I use an 8"" omlet pan and usually cook two tortillas.  This pan makes the sliding / flipping process much easier and lets you peek under the edge for doneness.  I actually don't flip my tortillas.  I kept trying but had some incredibly horrible failures.  My method is to slide the tortilla onto a large plate and then invert the pan over it and flip the plate and pan quickly.  During the cooking process (before the slide) I take the pan off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes several time.  This helps the runny center set up.  Just be sure that it is hot and sliding around in the pan before you attempt the slide or flip.  You also want to be careful not to overcook because the finished tortilla is best with a creamy texture.  I frequently stray from the traditional by adding a small amount of grated cheddar to the mix (gives a beautiful golden quality to the crust) and sprinkling some on the finished tortilla.  I used to add red and yellow peppers but it too can overpower the simple but delicious flavor of the tortilla.  My husband cares less about tradition and likes crumbled bacon added to the mix.  I usually give in.  Last thing...practice makes perfect when it comes to tortillas so if your first few tries are less than stellar, don't give up!",,
593927,280,2009-08-29,5,"Delicious for DH, DD (toddler) & I as per my slight modifications. I used two medium small potatoes and 6 eggs but next time would use only 5. I cooked the potatoes in 1/2 inch of extra virgin olive oil (I do suggest regular olive oil like another reviewer because mine smoked too much). I did not let the potatoes brown much at all. I then added the onion in a lesser amount. I covered the pan to slightly steam the potatoes and onions in order not to brown them and to cook them faster. When they were just about cooked I added sea salt (which was not coarse) to them which I think is very important or the dish will come out to bland. I kept these for a few hours in the refridgerator until morning (suhoor) so it would be much faster to finish. This worked well. I finished the recipe as per instructions also giving a little bit of salt to the eggs. I will definitely make this again.",,

As a matter of fact, a friend told me it was better than her friend's, who happens to be English.  I especially liked it because it did not call for a pudding mix, but rather a custard from scratch, which was as easy to make as from a box. It was not difficult to make at all.  I also added frozen berries as well as the strawberries, which seemed to only enhance the flavors.",,

I think the trick is to use fruit juice and red wine for the liquid instead of water as some other recipes do.It makes for a more intensive flavor.
BTW, you could give it an additional english title such as red fruit pudding so that it is more easily found with the search engine(just a suggestion). Thanks for posting.",,

I did find the stuffing to be a bit softer than I like and will probably cut down the amount of milk and sour cream next time, but that is personal preference.

1541360,310,2010-02-05,5,"Yay!  I am so exicited I finally got this to work!  I have made butter before by skimming my own cream off of milk, but have never been able to get this to work. So, when I saw this recipe on this site, I thought I'd give it another shot.  I too used my kitchen aid mixer, which if you have one, I would reccommend. Simply because when it turn into butter, it all collects into the wisk an you can lift the top up and let it drip dry for a couple minutes!  The only thing I wasn't sure of was speed. What I learned was to use hi speed, but back it down a gear if it's splashing. When you start out it's a liquid. Start on speed 8 or it will spash. Once it takes on the whipping cream form, turn it on max. But stand by, because if your not there when the butter seperates from the liquid, it will go everywhere! So I slowly started backing it down!  After I put it in the bowl, I use the back of a spoon and squeeze out any excess milk I can and then I quicKly run cold water over it to wash it clean. just some tips I picked up from a butter making sight!  It's perfect and I am so happy to finally have this!! Thank You! 8-)",,

354878,310,2010-07-13,5,"5 Stars is a must!!! I make my butter the same way, but I do ""wash"" and ""work"" the butter after the separating process.  I add salt during the working process. I do a quart of cream at a time and it yields about 50/50 ratio of butter and buttermilk.  I let the buttermilk stand at room temperature for about 12 hours then refrigerate. Then the next morning make me some buttermilk biscuits and slather em up with some of that good ol butter.  P.S. Save a little buttermilk and add it to the cream the next time and let it sit out for a few hours at room temp to add a little extra flavor to the butter taste much deeper and complex.  Then start the process again.",,

I used my blender since I don't have a food processor.I can't believe how quick it is to make. I grew up with my Aunt's homemade butter that was not very good LOL
This was really nice but next time I will add just a bit of salt.It is sweeter then a store bought butter.
I used a piece of cheescloth in my sieve so I could gently use it to ""squeeze "" the liquid out.
It would be a fun thing to do with the kids on a stormy day.

I used Marsala wine,a close cousin to sherry and marinated (after cooking ) the chicken for 2 days in the stock in the fridge.  Because I started with skinless/boneless breasts the stock did not gel but it will be used as a base for another soup.

Although next time I will follow the recipe more closely, I did have to make a few small changes because in each case I didn't have fresh on-hand: I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I soaked and finely chopped, frozen broccoli, and dried basil (I also added some dried parsley). I didn't have walnuts so I had to omit those. I'm a vegan, so instead of using muenster, I used a vegan cheddar cheese that is made by Follow Your Heart, and instead of butter, I used a vegan margerine. The results were still amazing. I will make this again, next time with all-fresh ingredients. ",,

It combines sweet (like sweet potatoes), Oriental and a stuffing-like taste. I do not believe the combination works at all.  It would work better to pick one of the styles, instead of combining tastes that don't work well together. 

Stuffing Style: remove the brown sugar and soy sauce, add some soft breadcrumbs, double the basil.

Oriental Style: substitute almonds for walnuts, remove brown sugar and basil.

Sweet Style: remove soy sauce and basil. Increase the brown sugar.",,

I'm really astonished at how good it tastes!  I only had swiss so that's what I used... still good.

He reported back (quite surprised) that he really enjoyed it and asked me if I had used one of my faux sausages as the savory filling.  I explained it was a mushroom/broccoli/walnut stuffing that tasted so good.  The only modification I made was to use about half of the brown sugar called for, as I am wary of things being too sweet.

I didn&#039;t have broccoli so I substituted about 1-1/2 cups of swiss chard, and let me tell you, that was an EXCELLENT choice!  I might actually do this every time.  I also had to use pecans instead of walnuts (no big deal) and I used a combination of ricotta and mozzarella instead of muenster cheese.  The cheeses were a BIG success as well.

124249,342,2005-09-12,5,"My husband and I really liked this squash. the squash absorbed the flavor of the bacon grease with a hint of sweet. I also added the onion. I waited to add my salt because bacon drippings can be a little on the salty side.

216321,342,2006-01-31,5,Loved the way this tasted. The little bit of sugar and cream added a big bunch of flavor. I'm confused as to the previous reviews. What bacon grease? I read the orignial recipe over and over and didn't see the use of bacon. I didn't use any.,,
1496727,342,2010-03-08,5,"I made this last night and my husband that has never cared for squash, liked this dish!

DH came home with a huge amount of yellow squash, so I doubled the marinade. In making the marinade, I substituted Splenda for the sugar, used white wine instead of wine vinegar, & 10 or 12 cloves of garlic. I shared part of the squash recipe with a friend who also thought it was fantastic. Try this, you are going to love it!!!",,

I also use red instead of green pepper (personal preference) in the overall ingredients.  Thank you, Peppermintkitty!",,

It's so easy and has great flavor. Plus I am on Weight Watchers.  I figure it's worth 1-2 points each serving. When the squash is almost gone .. I just add more to the marinade.

466582,346,2007-06-17,5,"Mmm this was wonderful.  We roasted the potatoes but made the aioli as directed, adding a little bit of lemon juice to low-fat mayonnaise.  The flavour was awesome. I was going to halve the recipe because there are only 2 of us but since there was only 1/2 cup left in the jar I used it all.  I'm glad I did, I can't wait to use it again!",,
366118,346,2007-08-20,5,Outstanding!! What a delicious dipping sauce. We even enjoyed dipping our carrots and cucumber (fresh from the garden) in the aioli. The entire family enjoyed. Thanks Kenk!!,,
649331,346,2007-11-14,3,"I really liked this. Instead of boiling the potatoes, I fried them. It was faster this way. They ended up tasting cheesy. I would have never imagines they would taste this good. The reason I'm only giving it a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 is because they were very greasy.",,
174096,346,2007-11-17,4,Thanks for easy and good recipe!  I used the recommended lemon juice to thin out the mayo.  It had a nice garlic flavor and made a great addition to the potluck I took it to.,,

762195,346,2008-03-31,5,"I'm sure mine didn't turn out the way intended, as I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces (since I don't like large bites of potato). Then, on top of doing that, I left them in the water after boiling, until I was ready for them, (I knew all along what the result might be, based on the things I was doing lol). I considered posting my result on here as a new recipe, but realized that really, it's still the same recipe, with a slight variation, so others can choose which way they're in the mood for, each time they make it. What happened was that as I was mixing everything together, yes, go figure, the potatoes started falling apart. So, I ended up with something between mashed potatoes & potato salad, only far more garlicky, but very good. Oh, & I did add a tad of dried dill, sweet basil & white pepper. My son had wanted hamburgers, but I didn't want to serve the typical chips, or fries or macaroni & cheese with them, so when I found this recipe I thought it would be a nice fit, a little less plain. I also served it with my Caribbean Coleslaw recipe (#290325) which was nice & light which helped balance out the garlic flavor. For desert I served my Rocky Road Chocolate Mousse (#286486) which was nice, because it was cool & light, & we could each choose how much we wanted, I only had a little because by that time I was very full (duh).  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe that was simple and apparently infallible lol!",,

I think next time if served as a sandwich I would dice up the chunks and the ham pieces and celery into smaller bits. If served over lettuce it is just fine the way it is. When you chill it for several hours it tastes one way-very Hawaiian and when you let it warm up while serving you can really taste the olives. Both ways were winners.

It is my belief, and only my belief, veggies in a frittata should be crisp tender.  Hope you don't mind that I took some liberty with this recipe.  I sliced the squash thin and added some green onions and red bell pepper.  Cooked the onion and bell pepper for a few minutes in a lightly buttered cast iron skillet, added the squash and cooked to wilt.  Poured the eggs mixture of egg substitute mixed with 1 tablespoon crème fraiche, black pepper and Italian seasoning over the veggies.  Cooked, lifting egg to allow the uncooked portion to go to the bottom of the pan.

I wonder if spraying a broiler pan with Pam and putting them in the oven would work?  Maybe I'll try that the next time I want to make these when I have an extra supply of squash.  A friend dropped off a box (maybe 100 small squash)and I chose a bunch of Zaar yellow squash recipes that appealed to me.  The only problem is that I still have half a box left!  I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.  I just chopped the onion roughly, and the machine did the rest.  It makes one life a lot easier.  Thank you riffraff for the tasty and savory recipe.",,

1381401,399,2009-09-12,5,I'm Hungarian. I go back to my family's homes in Hungary every year for 6-8 weeks! This is the way they make their spsetzle. PREFECT! So yummy! Thank you! It bought me back home. Alizka,,
1436855,399,2009-11-04,5,"I made this tonight to go with chicken paprikash.  The dumplings were wonderful!  It made enough for about 6-8 people, so i sauteed half of them in butter and salt, and topped those with the chicken and used the other half for chicken and dumplings.  These are the perfect chewy consistency, just like I was looking for.
Thanks for sharing your recipe!",,
5686,400,2001-02-12,5,"The dish is wonderful! It so easy to make, it takes 15-20 min :). Also I like to serve it with butter and sour cream. Everytime I cook Spaetzle my husband ask if there anything is left. Though, I always cook more. Try, and you''ll see how easy and delicious it is!",,
10291,400,2001-05-30,1,"As a German National, growing up in the birthplace of Spaetzle in the Swabian community, having had Spaetzle twice a week since I can remember, I have to tell you that Spaetzle are not made with milk. You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle. Sometimes my Mom just made Spaetzle, browned some onions in butter and put them over the spaetzle, serve with a fresh green salad and you got a complete meal.",,
135162,400,2004-04-09,5,Good recipe.  Had with Rouladen and it worked great.  Noodles floated to the top within 5 minutes so I drained at about 7 minutes and they were cooked,,
280271,400,2007-02-17,5,"This recipe is so close to the one that I received with my Spaetzle maker that I got from a German Store. The only thing different is that mine uses 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup milk. My spaetzle maker is not a potato ricer. It has large holes. (like little dumplings). DH and I like them fried in butter. We had them cooked this way at a German resturant once and it's the only way we like to eat them now!  Thanks, Melody for posting.",,
58762,401,2009-03-01,3,"This was ok.  We thought it had too much whip cream though.

Also, you may want to update the recipe with servings and freezing time. =)",,
31364,402,2004-02-21,5,"Not bad at all! Fairly easy and the kids gobbled them up. Would be easier, if not as tasty though, to  use with english muffins.",,
96364,402,2004-06-30,5,We really loved them. I used pilsbury premade pizza dough. It was so easy. I suggest more seasonings though. Very good!,,
804550,404,2009-01-14,4,"Very refreshing coffee that is great for a hot summers day or any time of year. I actually love iced drinks in the dead of winter as sitting by the fire place can get pretty hot. :)

476796,404,2015-04-22,4,"This was delicious! Although, a little guidance on how much sugar to use would be helpful. It ended up being more than I anticipated, so my drink was a little more melted than ideal by the time I got it just right.  Thanks! I&#039;ll be enjoying this all summer.",,
804550,407,2009-01-07,5,"I give this a 5-STAR WOW factor! I just love this, however I used fudge ripple ice cream as that was what I had on hand. I'll be making this again real soon! Thanks for posting!

1248818,407,2011-09-22,5,I made it with French Vanilla ice cream and topped it with some chocolate sauce.  Yum!,,
33812,408,2002-03-26,4,"This recipe is very good.  I did make one change.  Instead of tomatoe soup, I added 1 can of stewed tomatoes.",,
20754,408,2006-06-07,5,This is a fantastic recipe!  I served it over noodles with fresh Italian bread.  Next time I will make it using hot sausage.  Thanks for a great recipe Zaney1,,
20754,409,2004-04-02,3,"Well,  first want to say the time for baking isn't right.  I had this in the oven for for this recipe are not 40 minutes an the middle was still soupy.  Does not say what size pan so that could be why this happened.  I figured a 9 inch square maybe it should have been a 9x13.  Edges got hard while the middle was chewy!  May try again with the bigger pan.  Better explanation would be great  ; )",,
55729,411,2002-12-02,3,"DO NOT do what I did, and put all the raisins & nuts in the blender & turn it on!!!! Not unless you like eau de burnt motor! Better to put a few raisins & nuts in at a time and grind. Also, it didn't set. So I pried it out of the pan & rolled it in 32 balls instead. I rolled the balls in a total of 1 c. sweetened coconut that I had colored red. That said, these are a cool texture, and the perfect mix of salty and sweet. A great ""healthier"" addition to a cookie platter. I would have been perfectly happy giving them 5 stars if I had known from the beginning that I would be rolling them into balls. (My blender is fine, BTW <blush>)",,
524486,411,2008-05-04,5,"5 Stars for easy to make and tasty too.  I have a heavy duty blender so the chopping was a breeze, but you could chop by hand as well. 
I doubled the recipe and used half raisins and half dates for the fruit portion.  I also added some cinnamon, cardamom and ginger to the mix.  Overall very tasty.",,
129647,412,2004-03-06,4,excellent!! Very good I enjoyed it more once I put it in the freezer to make it thicker. It was more like a shake.,,
169430,412,2007-05-08,4,Lovely treat indeed. Simple to make and oh so tasty. This was delightful on this wonderful sunny afternoon. I will make it again and again but I'll make it with even stronger coffee. I used fat free evap milk and Splenda.,,
42617,412,2007-07-31,5,This is a yummy recipe. Super easy with the right amount of creaminess & sweetness. I used whole milk condensed milk and increased the espresso a bit. A keeper. Thanks for sharing!,,
804550,413,2009-01-08,5,This is a refreshing drink for any season! I quartered the recipe as I was the only one drinking it but I can see serving this as a instead of dessert drink at a summer get together with family or friends! Or as a late afternoon pick-me up. Thanks for posting! This recipe was tagged for the Comfort Cafe's January 2009 tag game.,,
18742,414,2003-06-17,5,I made this recipe using the mushrooms and the lamb.  It is an easy recipe but does take a lot of time.  I would make it again because we loved it!,,
121840,414,2004-03-07,5,"This is recipe is very authentic.  It is wonderful, didn't change a thing.  Worth the time and effort. Made the ciabata bread to go with it, and it was delicious.  Good fun for an afternoon of cooking!",,
126895,414,2004-03-14,5,"Ver nice. Everyone loved it. Got comments like this: ""I don't normally like eggplant, but this was really nice"".",,
173674,414,2004-12-14,5,"Thank you so much for this recipe. I prepared it ahead of time for my husband's parents. They happen to be on a real Greek kick now and really appreciated this dish. I halved the recipe beautifully and served with crusty bread, and fruit salad. We had a teriffic just-adults meal.",,
148490,414,2005-10-13,5,This is the greatest recipe I have made on recipezaar!! Friends say it is better than our local Mediterranean Restaurant. I do alter it a bit though - I add about 1 lb of ground lamb and use only 1 cup of mushrooms. I also bake the eggplant with olive oil at 350 for 10-12 min (as per Mean Chef recipe #29381). It is SO amazing even my super petite friend weighing in at only 100lbs gos back for seconds! Thanks Barbara!,,
64306,414,2006-06-17,5,"Rather involved, but well-worth the effort.  Excellent dish.  Full flavored taste of the middle east.  ",,
272053,414,2006-09-04,5,"I make the meat (minced lamb) version of this recipe and everyone loves it. Don;t be put off by the author saying that it is involved....it's not the most time consuming thing I have cooked, and if you make enough you can have some the next day for lunch! ",,
477205,414,2007-06-19,5,"I asked my boyfriend to make this recipe for a dinner party we were having. He complained because he hates eggplant. By the end of the dinner party, people were scrapeing the dish trying to get the last of it. We halved the recipe but now I wish we hadn't! Not only is this our favorite moussaka recipes, it's one of my all-time favorite dishes!",,
262090,414,2007-10-04,5,"This was excellent. 
I used the full meat mix with half the bechamel and 2/3 of the topping. It all went into 2 large loaf tins. One fed our family and the other went into the freezer. We just polished off the frozen one and it was just as good as the first.
For the eggplant, I just sliced them, brushed with olive oil and cooked until browned to reduce the richness of the meal. 
Even the eggplant hating kids ate it with gusto.",,
465542,414,2007-12-19,5,"Wonderful!  This is now my favorite moussaka recipe - delicious as is, and also a great base to add to and play with.  The detailed instructions are very helpful.
Thank you!",,
356986,414,2008-09-26,5,"Well now, this was certainly not something to just ""whip together"", just like you said. I am very adventurous, and love to take on a challenge. I also adore Greek food, and my dad orders this at a Greek diner he and my mom go to all the time, so I figured,""Why not?"" It came out so good, that my neighbor and her husband,and some of her family, who are from Greece, gave me kudos for this effort! I am grateful to you for making me look so good! I cannot imagine making this all the time, but I know I don't have to go out to a restaurant and pay tons of money for something so awesome I can make at home! Thanks so much for posting!",,
58104,414,2008-10-01,5,"This is no more work then making a lasagna! I did make a couple of changes. I added green peppers to the onions and left them in a larger chop then fine. Did add ground meat along with the mushrooms. Started this the day before browning stove top then finished in the crock pot. Made the Bechamel in the microwave. First melted in a large glass bowl added the flour stirred till smooth, added the milk and microwaved till thick. Mixed the eggs and ricotta together till smooth and then added to the sauce. I would next time use 1 cup less milk. I had a lot left over that would have overfilled the pan.  Didn`t have parm so I use mozzarella cheese. I do think the parm would be the better choice. I also had to bake an additional 20 minutes. Rising the temperature to 350 should do the trick to bake for 45-60 minutes. Thanks for the good eats! ;)",,
868626,414,2009-07-24,5,"Made as is, this is one mighty fine Moussaka!  The flavors were just right and pleased all at the table.  A definate 5 stars for this one Barbara!",,

Pain in the backside to make but the results are very rewarding. 10/10",,
1446736,414,2009-11-14,5,Simply perfection in a dish!  I saw the many positive reviews for this recipe and decided to give it a try. Yes - it's alot of prep work but the results were worth every painstaking minute!  I actually included thinly sliced & gently pan-fried potato slices at the bottom of the dish before adding the layers.  A real hit all around!  What a terrific way to get my two small boys to eat their veggies!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!,,
1528849,414,2010-03-11,5,"Loved the recipe, but would cut the eggplant a little thicker.  Also added 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the mushroom sauce for some zing.  The moussaka seemed a little sweet the first day, but thought the sweetness lessened and flavor improved the second.  I would consider making this a day ahead and reheating.  The 3 inch deep dish is a must, as I had to use less of the bechamel sauce.",,
993648,414,2010-04-09,5,"Love this recipe!!!  I shortened the prep time by using a jar of tomato sauce and adding the mushrooms and onions to it.  I also didn't flour the eggplant and baked it in the oven instead of individually in a frying pan.  I kept everything else the same, and the result was delicious.  My boyfriend went back for thirds!",,
1234395,414,2011-09-22,5,I don't know when I have enjoyed my food more then when eating this delicious Greek dish.  I didn't mind the work involved because the end result was well worth the effort.  I have made it a few times for company and get rave reviews from all around the table!,,
74732,414,2013-08-11,5,Great recipe!!!  My husband and I enjoyed it very much and it made our romantic dinner very special!,,
62264,414,2014-01-27,5,"Broke this down over several days - added lasagna noodles and made a gi-normous (15 x 18) pan - so doubled tomato sauce (opted for 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork) one evening, broiled the eggplant slices and assembled the net day &amp; sauced it with double batch of Bechamel today. I used the ricotta as its own layer and folded in about a cup of crumbled Bulgarian feta and topped the pan with the Bechamel over  a layer of shredded mozzarella. Not traditional but delicious and has enough structural integrity to handle freezing. Thanks for a keeper that we made into either Greek lasagna or Italian Moussaka. LOL! Thanks for posting!",,
392739,418,2007-06-26,5,"I made this recipe using White Chocolate. It was very good, but I would use less sugar next time as this was a little too sweet. (but I think it was from using the white choc)It was easy to make. My husband has had two pieces already. I will try and do it again in the proper size pan. I used an 8 x 8 and it took twice as long to bake, and was to thick. . But that was my own fault. Thanks for sharing  Next time I will do as I was told and use unsweetened choc. lol",,
13483,422,2002-01-07,4,Easy and simple meal in a minute.  I left out the olives as I am not that fond of them.  But I did add tabasco and garlic.  Neat recipe.,,
183379,423,2004-12-27,2,"I thought that the taste was a little bland, with some tweeking, it could be ok. I know its better for you, but not much of a fan of the fat free, it doesnt work in this receipe. I will try again.",,
704945,423,2008-03-06,0,what brand of fat free parmesan cheese do you use?? i have been looking for some for over a year now and i would be so greatful if you could tell me where you get it and the brand. thank you,,

a favorite dessert of my boyfriend
beautiful presentation, he said it was the best he's ever had and ate 3 pcs in one sitting
i used cinnamon bread (pepperidge farm) instead of cinnamon raisin, since we do not like raisins, 
added some dried cherries between the bread layers, this was a nice substitution
this recipe is a keeper, thanks",,
172169,429,2004-11-30,3,"I agree with susan529, cherries taste better than raisins. Tried it with plain white bread since I had no cinammon bread, came out good anyway. Thanks.",,
106282,429,2005-06-22,1,"I was disappointed in this recipe.  First of all, I found a pie dish to be much too small.  I had to use a 2 qt. dish.  Second, I think the apples and the bread needed to be mixed together and not layered.  I think it would have come out better that way.  I will do that next time.  The overall flavor was pretty good.  Not my favorite recipe.",,

Thanks",,
242729,431,2009-06-14,4,"A wonderful classic that I tweaked according to cheese availibilty, I used feta! I loved the proportions of oil to vinegar and also the amount of basil as well. I used local French onions and enjoyed this with my lunch out on the sunny terrace. I decided to layer it and not mix it - the flavours were STLL amazing though! Made for Summer Salads in the Photos Forum. Merci, FT:-)",,
4470,431,2009-08-16,5,An easy tasty salad that is just right for Summer - All the ingredients came from the garden except the cheese - The lite mozzarella was just right in combination with the other stronger flavors  Thanks for a lovely side sald with my burger,,
287084,431,2009-08-29,5,"This was super yummy even though My husband ate the cheese, so mine didn't have any. I also used tomatoes from the garden and normal onion, as that's what I had, and it still tasted good. If i had been thinking I would've cut the tomatoes into wedge slices or bigger bite size pieces... because it said chopped, I cut the tomatoes into smaller pieces.  Also I imagine that goat cheese would do very well in this salad. after i cut the tomatoes I noticed lots of juice as mine were seedy, so I strained them before adding in the liquids.",,
844554,431,2009-10-16,5,Great salad! Loved the dressing with the basil. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and used a sweet onion (didn't have vidalia). Will make again. Thanks.,,

27381,432,2003-02-27,5,"Oh boy is this good! I used frozen blueberries and added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the filling to make sure it wasn't too runny. I sprinkled sugar on top of the crust for a nice sweet crunchy topping. The finished product smelled fabulous, with the berry juices just bubbling away inside the crust. A nice subtle undertone of cinnamon and lemon peel adds zing to the pie! A real winner! Thanks!",,

192809,432,2006-07-11,5,"This was the pie that almost never was.  I had a really off day with the crust, and was able to squeak out just one.  Openfaced, it still came out absolutely perfect!  I love that the blueberries stay whole, and the lemon peel really make this outstanding.  I also added some ground cardamom, brushed the bottom crust with egg white, and added a dash of corn starch.",,
253131,432,2006-08-28,5,"This recipe made a very tasty pie and was so easy to follow.  I omitted the lemon rind since I didn't have any, but I can imagine how much tastier it would be with the addition.

I added some cornstarch to the dry ingredients as I don't care for a soupy pie, used butter instead of margarine, and it turned out great.

358698,432,2007-07-15,5,"I have made this twice now.  I tried a different blueberry pie recipe in between my trials of this one, just for comparison. This is a great pie, and definitely superior to any other blueberry pie recipe I have tried before.  The addition of cinnamon and nutmeg, along with the lemon rind, made it extra delicious. I used the Most Incredible No Fail Pie Crust Recipe #28943 and it was terrific with this pie. The only adjustments I made the second time I made it were to add one additional cup of blueberries and to omit the margarine.  It was just fine without the margarine and the extra berries just made it a bit fuller. Will be putting this in the forever book.",,

Good taste and not too sweet.  Very enjoyable.",,

Because of the limits of my oven, I baked the biscotti in two 9-inch long loaf pans, which I had greased and floured. The dough was pretty sticky, but since I didn't attempt to form it there was no problem. My short loaves baked in the 30 minutes given, I then sliced them and baked again as the recipe states.

I then lessened the sugars to another 1/4 c white sugar and only 1/2 c brown sugar.  Instead of shortening (only cause I didn't have any) I used margarine.  Followed the rest of the recipe.

I love rhubarb so I would have liked more rhubarb flavor out of them but to serve to others (most of whom probably aren't as big fans of rhubarb as I am) I think this is a wonderful combination of sweet and (just a bit) tart.

We loved Gado-Gado which is Indonesian but the Malay love it also and it is seen on many restaurant menus throughout the country.  Southeast Asians normally peel their cucumbers but since we hae returned to living in the states I DON'T, not only because of the nutrient value, but also it adds color to the salad.  I also add shredded carrots to the salad for the same reason but keep the rest of the veggies most like how it was served in Malaysia and Indonesia. <3  The secret to having the BEST Gado-Gado is the fresh peanut sauce that is used as the dressing.  If making it fresh isn't your thing, try using Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce found in your local Safeway store in the Ethic region.  It's the most like the Indonesian/Malay sauce served with this salad.  MOST recipes in Malaysia include Tofu cut into small cubes, dusted in cornstarch and fried up in a wok and then added on top of the salad just before serving.  It's wonderful!!

I held these in a baking dish in a warm oven as they came off the heat - and I sprayed between the crepes so they wouldn't stick together.  (Whole lotta sprayin' going on!)  I got 12 crepes.

This is a quick delicious layered Jello pudding pie. I’ve made it since the 90’s. It’s also delicious using Pistschio pudding. You can also use lemon pudding using a lemon pie recipe. All flavors are great for summer events. My daughter actually made this and told me she made Mississippi Mud. I told her sorry but it’s not. I can’t believe people misname or rename things wrongly but maybe they accidentally didnt really know. I told my daughter I would be embarrassed for her if she served this Jello recipe (which is delicious too) and called it Mississippi Mud out in public. Yes, I’m old and 50.

I used egg substitute with good success and added a bit of fresh rosemary to the cakes as I love the combination of rosemary with blue cheese. I had concern with the cake holding together while making, but it was not a problem, and refridgerating the batter I'm sure helped. This recipe is one that can be very versatile, and I can see making it with other combinations such as feta with oregano & kalamata olives or asiago with basil and garlic. The sauce while simple complimented the cakes and next time as a personal preference I may use red wine in the sauce rather than white.  Great meatless meal for vegetarians or side dish to simple broiled fish or chicken.  Thank you Strawberry Girl for sharing the recipe.",,

I really like the fact that this is sweetened with honey rather than sugar- it gives it a bit of a unique taste, plus I subscribe to the idea that natural sweeteners like honey, are better for you than white sugar, so that's nice too!  Good proportion of coffee to milk and certainly very easy!  I did find it a smidge sweet for my taste.  Next time I would reduce the honey, but I do typically take my coffee with just milk or cream.

169430,464,2007-05-10,4,I know that the honey has been a high point for this recipe but I subbed Splenda for diabetic reasons and used skim milk. I still loved it. I also made an amount of 1 serving and should have had a much larger glass. This isn't a skimpy serving. It's frosty cold and yummy.,,

To add some flavor, I brewed the coffee with a cinnamon stick and a tiny cap ful of Torani vanilla syrup. When I first tasted this, I thought the honey was really over powering and this tasted almost like a super strong tea. I added one truvia packet to my cup and that made it a little better - but I think next time I'll skip the honey all together and just use truvia. Thanks for sharing!",,

65768,471,2008-01-10,3,"We stuck quite close to the recipe, and the 2 of us gave it mixed reviews.  I thought the flavors were marvelous, and would easily award 4 stars.  The blend of tarragon, thyme and rosemary in the breading is sublime; it's the first time I've ever liked anything with tarragon, possibly because we used fresh not dried.  We substituted about half the oil in the vinaigrette with white wine instead, and I thought it tasted a bit like commercial salad dressing; no idea if that's due to the substitution.  I thought it might have been brighter if it used fresh-squeezed lemon juice instead of rice wine vinegar.  The horseradish in the breading practically disappears, but that's a hazard of cooking horseradish; it's always strongest uncooked.  Our big change was that we left our 1.3 lb salmon fillet whole w/ skin on the back, seared both sides, but only breaded the skinless side.  We baked 20 min, and it was still cold raw in the middle.  So then we cut into smaller fillets and broiled about 7 minutes and it was finally done just right.  My SO didn't like the breading... there was a lot of it, and we caked it on heavy since it was only on one side.  She said she might prefer a lighter breading, something Japanese-style, or only use 1c. bread crumbs.  She'd only give this 2 or grudgingly 3 stars.  Probably a recipe we'll experiment with... the herbs were wonderful!",,

34196,502,2008-04-19,5,"I tried this recipe and it was an absolute 10 with my family.  I switched it up a little..... I used red wine rather then vermouth, put crab meat on top of the mushrooms and used mozzarella rather then feta.  It turned out great.  Thanks for posting!",,
173880,502,2009-04-21,4,Very tasty! I substituted white wine for vermouth and brie for the feta cheese. I think next time I will skip browning the chicken breast because some of the chicken was a little dry. Otherwise this was delicious. Thanks for posting!,,
19724,503,2001-11-26,4,"I am Malaysian and I have an awesome satay recipe that takes over 12 hours to make (much chopping, blending and overnight marinating required). This one took me about 30 minutes and used ingredients found in almost any American kitchen. For the sauce I used chunky peanut butter (I didn't want a smooth peanut paste), a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of chili sauce and added a tbsp of maple syrup (the Malaysian satay peanut sauce is sweet and spicy). Bottomline: Authentic-tasting? Not really. Easy? YES.",,
43152,503,2002-06-20,3,This title is a bit misleading for those who know true SE Asia cooking.  The recipe is interesting though and I recommend it.  I would lighten up on the soy sauce in the peanut sauce-it over powers it.  Overall a good meal worth repeating.,,
187103,503,2005-02-09,3,"Hmmm... that was interesting!  I really liked the marinade for the meat, but 2 whole large onions?!? I think that's gotta be a mistake.  I put in one, and there was hardly enough moisture left to accommodate another, let alone the one!  The sauce is good, but a little thick and overpowering.  I was thinking a little chicken broth or something might thin it out and make it more of a sauce than peanut butter with some coconut flavor and spices. I served this as a main dish over rice noodles, and over-all, I think it is worth making again.  I'd definitly like to try the meat skewers on the BBQ.  I bet that would be REALLY good!",,
64625,504,2004-10-14,5,"This is good...I had half the amount of pink salmon fillet called for (serves 3), so pretty much halved the rest of the ingredients, except I wasn't really measuring, just eyeballing the amounts as I added them..I didn't have the garnishes at hand either, but this recipe turned out a delicious main course that I have to make again really soon!",,

Even my picky kids liked it.  It does make a large amount.  Enough for at least two meals for the four of us.",,

4740,506,2005-01-30,5,Absolutely delicious.  I added a can of mushrooms.  I too had a problem with it being a little bit too salty.  Next time I won't add the whole 2 teaspoons of garlic salt.,,
140132,506,2005-09-09,5,"I thought this dish was very good, and just as easy to make (which I like). I did omit the garlic salt and use fresh garlic, and I also added mushrooms.

35526,506,2006-11-12,5,"I have to say, with just a few ingredients this dish is comforting and delicious.  I made this dish with a few changes for dietary reasons. I also cut the recipe in half because there are only 2 of us.  I left out the butter, and used low fat mushroom soup and added some sauteed mushroom to get another veggie in.  This IS REALLY REALLY GOOD!!  Can't wait to take it for lunch this week.",,

296085,506,2009-05-04,4,"Not a bad recipe. 
I tweaked it as most did. 
I used CO Chicken soup. 
Less Cheese. 
Dash red pepper flakes.
White wine and milk
Assorted  cheeses (provolone, chedder, smoked something)
Bucati (straw spaghetti)

It makes a HUGE amount. I froze half so be prepared to find a huge bowl for mixing. 
It was better the next day. 
Just what I was craving. 

Thanks

For a double batch I added one box of Certo and just dumped it into the boiling apple juices. It was my first time canning anything or making jelly and it was simple and turned out really well. I got many compliments so far for this jelly. I will be using this as my staple apple jelly. Thanks Helen!,,
58104,512,2005-11-29,5,So very good! I made the recipe for 1. I used butterscotch. This cam out so frothy! As you can see in the pictures! I really don`t understand the other review with 1 star. But that thier choice! I found it excellent!,,

956843,512,2008-12-19,5,This was great! I used 3 splenda packets and torani sugar free caramel syrup. It gets so foamy that it almost tastes like there is milk in it yet its under 5 calories! Thanks for posting!,,

GREAT Dinner Party meal",,
5285,517,2001-05-30,4,"Oh, this was yummy. I screwed up the recipe like mad - parsley in the stuffing rather than in the meat, and forgot to buy oats so I used bread crumbs & ground walnuts instead. I smothered a slice in skordalia, took a bite and kinda jumped in my seat. I'm not giving it five stars because that would seem a little absurd, but it sure is yummy.",,

4470,519,2003-01-20,0,This time I cooked the hash browns in a toaster oven and they were perfect.   I diced the potatoes a little larger than I would for the conventional oven as the heat seems more direct.  Once again they were crisp outside and soft centered. Easy excellent recipe,,

110875,519,2004-06-21,5,"An easy dish to make, turned out great. Loved the flavor.  I added 1/2 tsp each garlic powder and onion powder. I too cooked mine a little longer, we like the hash browns crispy. As good as a resturant. Thank you for sharing.",,
37636,519,2004-08-03,5,"Very good! I doubled the red pepper in mine just to have it a little spicy, and it was not too hot. Easy to prepare and has a good crispiness without cooking in oil. Makes an excellent addition to breakfast! Thanks for posting.",,
65056,519,2004-10-24,5,"Very good!  We chopped our potatoes pretty finely in the food processor, and they turned out great.  Nice and crisp and flavorful.  I reduced the red peppers (I used cayenne) to just a dash because I was worried that it would be too spicy, but the spices mellow a lot during cooking.  Mine were lovely and crisp, chewy and tender (just like hashbrowns should be!)  This is a really nice breakfast recipe, because you can just throw it in the oven while you're making pancakes and eggs on the range and not have to worry about it or deal with another pan on the stove.    Very good flavor and  very nice that you can just put them in the oven and forget them and worry about the rest of the meal!  I love hashbrowns and this is surely a keeper.  ",,
158966,519,2004-12-29,5,I made this for Christmas brunch. The family LOVED it. I used frozen shredded potatoes and cut the hot spices by a third for the more sensitive tummies. I also added coarsely chopped yellow onion.  I didn’t have chili powder on hand so had to “cheat” with some Creole seasoning. The shredded potatoes cooked down quite a lot and I wished I had made more. Everyone wanted thirds. Thanks for this awesome recipe Gay Gilmore.  ,,

117974,519,2005-03-24,5,These hash browns were wonderful. I cut them small so they would cook through and turn out a little crunchy.  In 30 min they were crunchy and the spice was wonderful since they were so small.,,

I chose this recipe because I had everything available on my kitchen shelf and was low fat to boot.  I allowed my hashed browns to defrost quite a bit before cooking, used a small casserole dish, substituted cayenne pepper powder for red pepper, and cooked for recommended length of time.  This made the top nice and brown, and under layers soft.  Served with extra hot sauce, yum!  Easy, quick, and healthful!",,

There were a lot of steps, which isn't necessarily a  bad thing, but it didn't fall together like most cake recipes.  For example, I couldn't figure out why I had to melt the butter (and of course cool it) when I was just creaming it, or why add the sugar in two parts.   I had tons of tunnels.  And it would be helpful if there was a number for how long to bake.  At least a range, especially for us novice cooks.   It took 45 minutes for me.",,

525087,520,2007-11-13,5,"everyone LOVED this.  it's very sweet (even though i, too, omitted the extra 3/4 cup sugar).  i did not have fresh nutmeg, but used organic, and the spice mixture was wonderful.  it's great as a dessert with whipped cream, or as a nice breakfast with tea.  the directions do not mention where to add the butter, i just mixed it in with the other wet ingredients before blending with the dry.  thank you so much for posting this!  i will be making for Thanksgiving this year!",,
731061,520,2008-05-29,4,"this  was a real hit, i also omitted the 3/4 cup of sugar and the raisins. i also used chopped almonds instead of pecans, cause that is was i had on hand. i will make it again.",,
535633,520,2008-10-22,5,"I made this, this afternoon and we loved it.  It was so easy to make.  I didn't use the raisins.  While it was baking the whole house smelled like apples.  This will be added to my favorites.  Thank you for a great recipe.",,
751105,520,2008-11-27,0,"I see many people made it but there seems to be no mention at all of the butter and the extra sugar in the directions.  I had no choice, added the butter to the mixture and skipped the sugar--hope it works; I have to bring a dessert to dinner tonight!  Will rate it later.  Please complete the directions here or did I skip something perfectly obvious?",,
311853,520,2009-10-01,0,"i have now made this recipe twice out of 3 days. i find it very moist and sweet. i put more apple in just because, after 35 minutes it was done perfect with a little crunch on top.  really enjoyed sharing it with freinds who loved it too.thank you for sharing.",,
1579198,520,2010-03-24,4,This is a very good recipe. It's a near twin to a recipe my mother used to make. And I find that I like it better without the raisins. But all in all a keeper recipe.,,
781424,520,2012-10-14,5,"Perfect just as it is...the entire family loved it this one's a keeper Thank you for an easy but delicious recipe  I read some of the reviews and cannot understand why anyone would complain about  putting one cup of sugar in the entire recipe after all this is a  DESSERT and  not a meal and without the butter it woud be extremely dry, crumbly and the texture and taste would be awful 1 stick of butter as the recipe calls for is  also perfect!",,
2001969738,520,2018-07-14,5,"We pretty much love ANYTHING &quot;apple,&quot; &amp; that definitely includes this delicious, super easy &amp; quick to make cake...(It's one of my absolute favorites) I use 1/2 Cup granulated sugar &amp; 1/2 Cup packed dark brown sugar (to enrich the flavor a bit) &amp; leave the peel on Granny Smith apples...(It's even faster &amp; more nutritious) I love adding raisins (I find it doesn't matter a bit whether you use golden or dark raisins...I always &quot;plump&quot; them up first in a dish of hot water) I use whatever kind of nuts I have on hand which is usually either pecans or walnuts, but almonds work as well...&amp; I always toast them first...We love cinnamon so i always add an extra 1/2 t or more...For all you &quot;desert-aholics,&quot; I'm not ashamed to admit that I never make this TERRIFIC cake recipe without finishing with a homemade, rich, &amp; buttery caramel frosting...Thank you for sharing...",,
86520,524,2005-05-31,4,"The flavor is good but no way is there enough for 12 muffins. I barely got 6 jumbo muffins out of it and I used 2 cups chopped apricots and 1/2 cup nuts.
I used dried apricots that I rehydrated with boiling water. Instead of milk I used 1/2 cup apricot water as I knew the rehydrated apricots would not have as much juice as the fresh. I only used 1/3 cup sugar, that's my personal taste, I don't like muffins sweet. These were even too sweet for me. I would use 1/4 cup sugar for my taste. Thanks for a tasty apricot muffin recipe.",,
65056,524,2005-06-02,5,"I made this with fresh organic apricots that were too tart to eat out of hand and it turned out wonderfully.  You can really taste the apricots and all the flavors are very well-balanced.  I actually made this as a loaf, rather than muffins (by the way, just to note, 6 jumbo muffins should equal 12 regular-sized muffins, so I think that Dorel was mistaken in that respect).  It turned out with a lovely cake-like crumb, dense and moist.  I was surprised that the recipe instructed to add the apricot so early- most baked good recipes call for any fruit added to be added at the very end so that the fruit isn't broken down.  I think the fact that the apricots were added earlier and mashed a little as I mixed in the other ingredients made the bread moister and infused the whole thing with more apricot flavor.  I made a few subs- I used whole wheat pastry flour rather than all-purpose, sucanat rather than white sugar and butter instead of shortening.  I didn't find it at all too sweet, especially with the fresh apricots which are much less sweet than dried.  I really liked the flavor/texture that the walnuts added.  Just a really lovely bread. I liked it especially refrigerated and sliced thinly- mmm!",,
267778,524,2006-08-08,5,"These were really good! I was surprised how moist they were. My family is very picky - they don't like apricots, nuts or chunks, so I pureed the cots and left out the nuts and the sugar on top. I froze them and took them to a family reunion so everyone could taste one - all were pleasantly surprised! Thanks a bunch for a nice change in a muffin.",,
537188,524,2008-07-01,4,I had two apricots that needed using up so this recipe was perfect! I made a loaf instead of muffins. The nutmeg went really well. Thanks!,,
1611167,524,2010-06-29,4,Very delicious! Do not grease the sides of the muffin tin - just the bottoms. That way you can get lovely browned crusts. I think I'll cut down on the nutmeg next time or play around with another flavor...it's really strong!,,
1747728,524,2011-08-02,4,These muffins are very good! Next time I will add maybe a 1/4 cup more apricots and a little less baking powder. I didn't add any sugar on top and it was fine.,,
2337282,524,2012-07-21,4,"I followed the other people who made this as a bread. My kids helped make this. They love it. We did use the food processor for the apricots(kids preferance). I did not add nuts to one of the loafs, they do not like nuts either. I am glad ""dawneg"" suggested that. Since I doubled the recipe I put pecans in one loaf for myself. I had pecans at home and used them up in this recipe. When I doubled the recipe I did not double the nutmeg because one person said it was a little much. I may try using a little lemon zest in it next time. Overall fast, easy and good way to use up your apricots.",,
2000183139,524,2015-05-04,5,Very delicious. I subbed butter for the shortening (I usually do) and used up some of my frozen apricots from last year.  Instant family favorite!,,
424680,525,2011-08-04,5,"I did cut this recipe in half, & with the large head of cauliflower I had, the 2 of us still had 2 good servings each, & with a bit left over! We do love this veggie & you have a great, tasty way of fixing it! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed in Bargain Basement recipe tag]",,
9468,526,2001-05-16,4,"The first batch I made I poured out and had a clump at the bottom, which I discovered to be the pectin. But it tasted great! The second batch I mixed better to get the pectin in, and didn't like it near as well. I will be making mine in the future without the pectin. I also added about a teaspoon or so of Irish Cream syrup which was marvelous!
This is a very easy recipe if you have an easy espresso maker.",,
45739,526,2002-06-22,5,"I think I would add less sugar; it was too sweet for me.  Next time I will ""lighten it"" probably to include less sugar and skim milk.  It's a 5:1 recipe with sugar to taste-- 5 Milks to 1 espresso.  I put your original recipe mixture in a blender and added ice.  Lovely.  I used semi-skimmed milk but will try skim to lessen the fat calories.  THanks for posting!  Patty from England",,
3856,531,2001-01-29,3,average taste. Not particularly subtle,,
223979,533,2008-08-02,3,I thought this has too much vermouth.  I like the combo of cilantro and grapefruit.  I chopped the peppers without saving the seeds.  I will try this again and use less vermouth or substitute white wine,,
248831,534,2005-10-03,5,"Yum!  I made this for a party this past weekend.  I did make the error of sending DH to the store, so he didn't get enough mangos.  BUT, I mixed this salad with some lettuce and the flavor was still delicious.  Will make this again - exotic, fresh and delicions!",,
241579,534,2007-07-05,5,"I loved this salad!  I'm a daily salad eater, so this was a nice experiment for me.  I left out the carrots and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Tonight, I think I'll add a few chopped radishes to the mix.  Fantastic flavor, Dancer--thank you!",,

Good with turnip greens, too.",,

95743,535,2005-01-13,5,"What a great combination.  I used mustard greens and ended up doubling the apple juice so that I could cook the apples and greens down until very soft (recent dental surgery).  I'm guessing kids would love it that way and that's saying something for greens.  Give this one a try, even if you think you don't like greens.  It's teriffic.",,
143143,535,2005-10-07,5,"My S.O.loves mustard greens and really cleaned the plate when I made them this way. I didn't use soy margarine, just saute'd the apples in the apple juice before mixing with the greens.  Even I liked it and I don't like greens normally!",,
2205,536,2000-11-17,5,"Our family has enjoyed this recipe, time and time again with great success. Favorite topping for this is to serve with chili, grated cheese and onions. The kids love it simply with catsup. 
Either way this dish is a MAJOR favorite of our family. Great also for the kids who are learning to cook.",,
6702,536,2001-04-02,3,"The corn dog casserole tasted a lot like baked cornbread stuffing. I liked it and would eat it again, but it was a no go with the 10 year old. My four year old picked out the hot dogs but left most of the breading on her plate.
Also, it had to cook longer than indicated here. After 45 minutes it was done, so when you try the recipe, give yourself more time than stated.",,
7697,536,2001-04-04,1,"This was a huge let down for my family. I think if there was not as much sage, it might be ok. But not one single person in my family liked it. I don,t mean to be negative, but honestly, this dish was awful.",,
8208,536,2001-04-13,4,I like to make new dishes for potluck so I tried this recipe.  Everyone thought it was great and thought it was a fun and different kind of casserole.  You need to add Ketchup or BBQ sauce on the finished casserole to bring out the flavors - just like with corn dogs on a stick.,,
16951,536,2001-08-29,5,I cut this recipe in half since its just hubbie and me. Took a little longer than listed to bake (more like 35-40 minutes). We both LOVED it...no other acoutriments needed...served with cole slaw.,,
29920,536,2002-04-23,4,"Great kid pleaser meal!!I added smoked sausage for the hot dogs and it tasted great(I guess that makes it sausage casserole,huh:))I used Marie Callenders cornbread mixture(my favorite),this will be a regular on my table!Thanks for sharing!!!",,
28201,536,2002-06-03,5,This was so easy and so good! The celery added a nice flavor and texture to the dish.  Sort of tastes like a corndog without the stick!  Thanks Mysterygirl for posting another winner!,,
60260,536,2003-01-25,5,I've made this recipe before and it's super yummy if you like corn dogs!!  Serve with catsup and mustard!!!,,
61954,536,2003-02-09,3,It was a good easy recipe.  I learned that my son (3) is not too fond of celery yet. So we will try it again when his tastes change.,,
17803,536,2003-02-14,5,"Fast and easy dish here to make.  I liked the addition of the sage.  I did not have green onions so used a white one.  Oh man, I just read DDW's review I forgot about using catsup and mustard.  :-(  There is not even a crumb left to try catsup on!  Thanks for a great recipe that takes me right back to the Iowa State Fair and their corn dogs!",,
72482,536,2003-02-17,5,"The title sounds peculiar but this dish is great! It's definitely going to be a favorite of mine. Because of picky eaters I used half the amount of vegetables and half the amount of sage. I added a pinch of salt and some garlic powder. It was perfect. I also added a lot more cheese on the top than just 1/2 of a cup. It got toasted golden and crunchy; not ooey gooey; just wonderful. Also note that my dish was ready in 17 minutes, not 30! This would be a super dish to take to a potluck. I can't wait for the opportunity. And lastly, must have mustard to dip! YUM!",,
28373,536,2003-02-19,5,great recipe~ i made a smaller amount and left out the celery :) but still a good and easy meal!,,

66520,536,2003-05-29,5,"Great recipe & quick to make.  This was a hit at our house, even with those who do not like hot dogs.  To save extra time, I sauteed the celery and onions together.  This is a keeper recipe!",,
15572,536,2003-06-15,4,Very good.  We put the left overs in the frige and snacked on them for a couple of days.  ,,
39835,536,2003-06-27,3,I halved the recipe and used a bit more cheese than indicated but I felt that it needed something extra added to add more flavor--maybe sliced tomatoes on top of the casserole.,,
56130,536,2003-08-09,5,A recipe must be good if you forget an ingredient and the family still likes it!  I forgot the cheese but hubby and I still enjoyed this very much.  I also used yellow onions instead of green onions.  5 stars for originality!,,

56392,536,2004-07-02,4,"This casserole tasted just like corndogs without the sticks! I would reccomend eating this topped with your favorite corndog condiments. Ketchup and mustard mixed is what topped mine. I thought that it was alittle dry without the toppings. I think next time I'll try some extra onions, celery and cheese in the batter. Still a great tasting casserole for corndog lovers!",,
29300,536,2004-09-12,4,"This recipe is really good and the sage tastes wonderful in it. It really goes great with the cornbread. I took this to a potluck and everyone loved it. I brought mustard but wasn't really crazy about the taste of the mustard on this. I think that it was very good just by itself. The next time I will also use smoked sausage or little smokies. Thank you, MG.",,
177085,536,2005-02-07,3,"This recipe was good, served it with ketchup. I too felt it was dry without ketchup. It seemed like maybe it was missing something, but was a very good quick recipe. Would consider making again if I was in a time crunch with few ingredients on hand. ",,
149415,536,2005-02-17,4,"I liked it a lot. I kept telling the kids ""it's a kid pleaser"", but they still didn't take to it. The two year old ate two servings, however. I had to leave out the onion and celery because the kids don't like busy food. (ok, I snuck in some dried, minced onion- shh). It was a little dry that way, so when I make it again (and I will) I may add more milk or egg.",,

118840,536,2005-06-19,4,"Wow, this was really good!  We cut back on the sage a little and really piled on the cheese - the kids added some mustard at the table and they're already asking when we can have it again.  :)",,
218516,536,2005-06-23,0,"I slightly messed up the recipe by combining everything together instead of splitting the hot dog mix.  It was really good and my husband loved it.  We used turkey hot dogs, which were great.  One thing I might try next time is using a 2qt dish instead so it is a little thicker.",,
205428,536,2005-06-26,5,"Was very nice, i made it today and my bf and me liked it very much. I love corndogs but as they usually have to be fried and i try to not do it, when i found this recipe was very glad that was baked instead. I made some variations though, I used polenta meal with baking powder and all-purpouse flour, instead of the cornbread mix. It's already in my favorites and i will make it more, but i guess will use something else like mushrooms instead of celery :).Tnx 4 sharing",,
223926,536,2005-07-05,5,"Great recipe!!!  I used fresh sage, but other than that followed it exactly.  I will definitely be making it again. (I just had to put ketchup on top and it was a nice touch.)",,

59921,536,2007-03-14,4,"This was tasty. I love corn dogs, though. I omitted celery and the sage and used vegetarian hot dogs. Tasted great-just like a corndog.",,
55221,536,2007-04-10,2,"Although the baked casserole looked great, this recipe did not work for us because 1.) the taste of sage was very overpowering, and 2.) the overall texture was like Stove-Top Cornbread Stuffing with hot dog pieces stirred in.

400708,536,2012-07-29,5,"In my ongoing search for a meal my visiting DGD would eat tried this one.  She still wouldn't touch it but the rest of us loved it; what a great, easy dinner.  There was not a bite left over.  Such a differant dish with flavors that remind you of those fair corn dogs, but with enough extra to make it a meal.  I baked in an iron skillet mainly for the looks and it turned out great.  I'm sure another less picky eater will enjoy it so planning to make it again when my DGSs come to visit.",,
257414,536,2013-01-30,4,"I've been wanting to make this for some time because I like corn dogs, but this seems much easier and healthier. I used recipe # 345502 for the Jiffy Mix. I didn't have any green onions, so I used chopped red onion. I also added chili powder, garlic powder, and a diced jalepeno. <br/>It was pretty yummy and my 2 year old also approved!<br/>Thanks!",,
1609858,536,2013-08-26,4,Yummy!  Actually this was a lot better than I expected.  Way more sophisticated than a corn dog and a lot more flavor too.,,
42337,539,2004-11-30,5,This takes a little work but the taste in the end is worth all the effort.  I am planning on making this again for christmas.  ,,
19895,540,2001-09-26,3,Sorry it went a little sloopy but the kids liked it.,,
249363,540,2008-04-08,4,"I made this in my 1.5 quart Cuisinart freezer, so scaled the recipe down accordingly.  Should have noted that it uses regular condensed milk rather than sweetened condensed milk.. which explains why it was very very sweet.  Tasted great though!!! Thanks :-)",,
499806,540,2008-09-14,2,We never got to eat it. It never set up.,,
682466,540,2010-02-14,5,First time to ever make ice cream and my family and I loved it.  Very easy to make and delicious.  This will recipe will be saved on my cook book.  Thanks for sharing,,

131674,543,2006-06-11,5,"Wonderful!  I really loved the cucumber sauce.  It was quick and easy and really made the dish.  Even my picky eater said ""These are good!"".  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for a great dish.",,
289510,543,2007-08-01,5,"Delicious! I made the chicken to the recipe, cutting each breast into about 3 smaller pieces. I only marinated for 3 or so hours but the flavour was still excellent. The cucumber sauce (we know it as tzatziki) was great, although I couldnt get hold of any mint, fresh or dried, so left it out. I've just returned from a holiday in Greece so this was a fantastic meal for us to relive the wonderful food there! I will definitely be making again, thanks for sharing.",,
223979,543,2007-09-19,5,Great chicken!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  The flavors of the marinade were perfect.  I served this with some rice and a greek salad.  I will make this often!,,
768716,543,2008-02-19,5,"Very easy and very good!!

I used the more pedestrian versions of some of the ingredients and it still came out great.",,
399932,543,2008-02-28,0,"Absolutely fabulous.  I didn't have time to marinade the chicken for but 20 minutes.  The taste and mixture of ingredients were fa nominal.  I can't imagine how even more delicious it is with the marinade at 24 hours.  The cucumber sauce was also one of the best we have ever had.  I didn't have mint, and substituted tarragon in it's place.  It worked perfectly.",,
199685,543,2009-03-23,5,"Very, very good.  I've made it several times now and it's fabulous.  Incidentally, the tzatziki is the best recipe I've come across.  I modified the yogurt/mayo ratio to around 1.5/.5, and it's still great.  This recipe goes great with greek pilafi.",,
1273491,543,2009-05-20,0,"Made this very easy and very nice recipe with strips of chicken breast and put them in a pita pocket with some lettuce, onion, and sliced tomatoes (gyros style) with tzatziki sauce. This is a nice recipe for the tzatziki, using fresh mint. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken or fire up the gril, but the flavors came through just fine because I pan fried the chicken and the marinade together in a skillet on medium heat. As the chicken cooked, the marinade reduced and evaporated...then the chicken quickly browned beautifully, with a coating of those concentrated flavors.",,
1154995,543,2009-08-13,5,Loved this recipe! The only difference is that I used chicken thighs which were soooo good. I made this with the sauce and kittencal's greek salad. Thank you for this yummy recipe.,,
207907,543,2009-10-28,5,"This recipe is just wonderful. I marinated the chicken overnight. The next day, I spread all the chicken cubes on a baking sheet and broiled them. I made a triple batch because I was planning on using them for a party that had to be canceled. They were gone in two days with only 3 people in the house. I literally had to hide them from my son because he couldn't keep his hands off. He just kept popping them in his mouth. I ate them on a Greek salad. They ate them in pita pockets stuffed with veggies. The cucumber sauce was great too. Thanks. I will be making this again!",,
636278,543,2009-11-14,0,This recipe is delicious!  I marinated chicken cubes for about 8 hours and it was perfect.  The cucumber sauce is amazing!  I had originally purchased a cucumber sauce that had expired so I made this one instead and glad I did.  I haven't tasted a better one!...though I might go a little lighter on the salt next time.  Will be making this for company!   Thanks!,,
4601,543,2009-12-29,5,Very nice:)  I have a wheat allergy so this was a great recipe - completely wheat free.  I added some homemade hummus. It was delicious!,,
60989,543,2010-06-14,5,"Delish chicken. I didn't make the sauce, but the chicken is very flavorful and moist. Thanks!",,
1329782,543,2010-06-17,5,"Very nice.  I enjoyed the marinade and grilled the chicken which had a great flavor. I did change the cucumber sauce a bit adding some fresh lemon juice and no mayonnaise.  I prefer greek yogurt for my sauce. I actually served mine in a Naan bread with, diced tomatoes and some crisp lettuce.  It made a great sandwich.  I could easily served it as a full meal as well.  Very nice flavors. I had a light artichoke, olive salad as a small side dish.
Thx for a nice recipe.",,
1244997,543,2010-06-28,5,"Made the chicken portion of this recipe and loved it! I cut my chicken breasts into large chunks to be grilled on skewers and marinated for 8 hours. Perfect served with brown rice and grilled zucchini,squash and carrots.",,
1711484,543,2014-08-22,5,"Chicken is very tasty, and the sauce is excellent! Well, at least the way we make it. I use full-fat mayo and full-fat Greek yogurt. We eat it in a pita with feta cheese. (Lettuce and grilled onions would probably also be a good addition.)",,
185991,544,2005-10-05,5,Delicious combo of flavors. ,,
197023,544,2005-12-10,5,"I knew I’d love this – just from a glance at the fabulous blend of herbs – and I was absolutely delighted with this recipe.  I only made two small changes: I added slightly more garlic (I tend to always do that) and in step 4, as well as the specified amount of lemon juice, instead of water, I added some white wine.  This was really tasty warm (I’d defy anyone to resist trying it the dish at this point) but even more delicious at room temperature.  To me this looked more like a serving for 4, but it depends how many other dishes are to be served with it.  I could also imagine 1 or 2 scoffing it down without any difficulty!  Thanks so much for sharing.  A five plus recipe!  I’ll be making this again.",,
443503,544,2007-02-03,5,"This didn't really tempt me at first, but I decided ti give it a try, and it was wonderful! I highly recommend it! I added feta cheese, though. How can you have a Greek salad with no feta?!",,
68460,544,2007-08-27,5,"Delicious and different.  I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh cilantro for the fresh herb addition at the end.  I agree with Bluemoon...tastes great while still warm but left standing at room temp for 2 hours blended the flavors and made it outstanding.",,
704950,544,2008-03-20,4,"I was scared when I got to the point in the recipe where it said 1/2 cup water because I thought it was looking delicious without it but I put it in because that's what it said.  I think that this recipe would be great without the water, I thought that it diluted the flavors.  I am going to try it again without the water.  Thanks for the recipe!",,
5060,544,2008-10-09,4,"mmm this was quite a lovely salad, enjoyed it very much, although next time I will us a little less lemon.  I did not add the water, it seemed quite loose at it was.  i will make it again, thanks for posting,",,
378294,544,2010-04-08,1,"I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the water and it turned out watery and flavorless.",,
205750,544,2011-11-03,4,Don't include the water! I have made this lots of times and never added the water - it turns out lovely and tasty every time. Great combination of flavours for mushroom lovers.,,
2001924742,544,2018-01-11,4,I took the advice from other reviews and omitted the water and I'm glad I did. Lovely dish. I added spring onions to the herbs.,,
247241,546,2006-04-05,5,I made this like a grilled cheese sandwich and LOVED it!  What a nice change to the same old tuna sand.  Thanks for sharing this!!,,
124249,546,2007-04-16,5,"We enjopyed this twist to a tuna sandwich. The only thing we did different was to add slices of tomato and some lettuce.

360437,546,2008-12-28,4,"Different, but very good! I used cheddar cheese. Thanks!",,
11297,547,2002-06-10,4,"Thanks Doreen, this was easy & enjoyed by all.  I did cut down on the sour cream & mayonaise though as I didn't have a lot of either in the fridge at the time of making.  It was still yummy.:)",,
101376,547,2007-09-08,5,"Wow, these are incredible!
I loved the flavor and the ease with which the dish goes together.

I followed the ingredient list to a T ... with the exception of the technique of cooking the potatoes. I already had baked potatoes in the fridge I needed to use up, so I chopped those up , mashed 'em a little with a fork , and I didn't press the mixture through a sieve. 

So, although the texture was undoubtedly different , the taste was what it was supposed to be , and it's great! 

A definite repeat at our house!

Thanks for posting!!!",,
27037,548,2002-06-02,5,"This melts in your mouth!  I served this to my Book Club and they loved it!  My only suggestion would be to ""watch"" the amount of marinade the recipe makes; I adjusted the recipe for 6 people and had a TON more marinade than I needed.",,
43566,548,2002-06-10,5,Great Recipe. Even non-salmon eaters will like this salmon.,,
93380,548,2004-06-08,5,I really love salmon and I\\\'m always looking for new ways to make it. The salmon has a much better flavor if you marinade for SEVERAL hours or overnight.,,
256807,548,2006-04-17,5,absolutely delicious.  A big hit and easy to make.,,
158375,548,2006-05-29,3,"This was good, but with all of the other strong flavors, I couldn't taste any bourbon at all. I think next time I will increase the amount of bourbon in the recipe. ",,
606866,548,2007-10-07,5,"Wonderful marinade. I used my sealing machine to marinade in 10+ minutes. My son and I both loved it -- and I generally do not eat fish.

I had about 1.6lbs of salmon cut into 4 filets. The recipe here was sufficient for that. I pan cooked for 8 minutes on each side starting with skin side down. I still spooned some marinade over the filets and covered while they cooked.",,
194829,548,2008-05-27,5,"I took the advice of Girl Friday and increased the bourbon quite a bit. I really wanted that flavor to come through. It turned out great, slightly carmelized on the outside, tender and delicious on the inside. This is a great marinade for fish, but would also be good for chicken or pork. Served with balsamic asparagus, cinnamon-butter yeast rolls, and roasted herb potatoes. Yum!",,
37449,548,2008-07-27,5,I scaled this down for one and it came out very nicely! I served with corn on the cob and fresh sliced ripe tomatoes. Thanks!,,

989327,548,2009-01-24,0,"Have made this a few times now.  Doesn't matter about the juice, use OJ if no pineapple.  I added extra bourbon or JD. I also used sesame oil instead of veg.  Grated ginger is great too.  I also added cornstarch to reserve, heated and served it over top the salmon.  You can do so much with this as a base.  GREAT recipe!",,
1042986,548,2009-06-09,5,I made this last week with Copper River salmon.  At first I was concerned with the amount of oil called for because salmon is quite oily naturally but it worked out fine.  I may never prepare salmon any other way again...it was that delicious!  It's just the perfect light accent to the freshness of the fish...thanks for a fabulous recipe!,,
667853,548,2009-09-09,5,"This was AWESOME!  I grilled this on a cedar plank for about 25 minutes, and it was theeee best salmon I've ever had!  The family also gobbled this up, no complaints.  Great recipe!",,
1426583,548,2009-10-26,5,This is the exact recipe that Lone Star uses. The only difference is that they marinade for three days. YUMMY! Thanks.,,
799571,548,2010-01-27,5,"Very good, but needs to marinate several hours, one hour is just not enough to really get the flavor.",,
713116,548,2010-02-15,4,"This was really good.  I marinated it for two days, and as others suggested, added a *bit* more bourbon!  ;)
The flavor was still very mild, but it complemented the salmon nicely.  Yum!  I would give it 5 stars, rest of the family said it was good but they wished the marinade had a deeper flavor.",,
1440799,548,2010-02-15,5,"Made this for dinner tonight for my wife, and her boss and his wife. They all loved it, They dine in some pretty fancy restaurants and they were impressed.  Followed recipe but took advice from one review to marinate for several days  WOW !!!

227496,548,2010-06-08,5,I have made this many times but finally had to comment. My family loves this. My daughter would never even touch any fish until i made this. I like using orange juice instead of the pineapple. Great recipe!,,
9178,548,2010-07-08,5,"Boy! was this good!!!  Made this recipe for 4th of July for 10 people and it drew raves!!  Everyone commented on how much they liked the sweetness of the pineapple taste.  Of course, like others have suggested, I marinated for 3 days AND used more bourbon (about 3 ounces), and sesame oil.  One additional touch, I cooked the filets on cedar planks on my gas bbq.  Result -- FANTASTIC!!  Served with my Corn-Tomato-and-Black-Bean-Salsa.  Made a big hit!!",,
220403,548,2010-10-10,5,"Delicious!!  We made this for a birthday dinner for my dad, who loves fish.

Thank you!!",,
2457569,548,2012-10-19,5,"Loved this!  I'm not a fish/seafood lover, but hubby is and I still loved it.  I cooked it on a cedar plank and it was terrific.  The only change I made was to take the marinade, add cornstarch, and cook in a small skillet to thicken.  Served this to pour over salmon at the table.  MMMM!",,

Instead place thick slices of the cuke in pineapple juice to crisp them, drain after 10 minutes (at least) and pat dry with paper towels---then chop. I use the pineapple juice to substitute for salt in marinades and for the preparation of egg plant also. Happy low sodium eating!!",,

I made this recipe for the first time during Ready Set Cook for Wonderful Chicken Pizza With Fresh Basil  by WaterMelon recipe#116444. I made it again using my own sauce recipe#60997 and our favourite toppings. I froze the unbaked pizzas for a quick meal on another day and this crust was fabulous!

Worked really well - the dough had a lovely consistency and no problems baking with a thick layer of vegetables on top. Very good for sheaking in garlic for kids that are a bit garlic resistant at the moment.,,

I like that it is a large recipe, so instead of 4 batches I only need to make 1 at a time. I haven&#039;t tried freezing, but I bet it will do well.",,

I followed another posters suggestion and chopped down the carrots in a blender.....just pulse.....Creamy, and the most decadent soup I have ever experienced.

1539130,558,2010-02-18,5,"This soup was awesome!  I would probably omit the mayonnaise.  I also added bacon and it tasted great, I think adding bacon to many soups is a German way.  The consistency of this soup I will try to change somehow it reminded me of curdled milk so I will probably omit the potato flakes and the mayonnaise hoping it will just be smoother.  I made this last night and I will make it again for it reminds me of my mom & Grandma's German poatato soup.  Oh and I didn't have any red pepper but it was still very filling!",,

Essentially, I made 4 cups of chicken broth and then added 2.5 cups of veggie broth (or chicken broth if you choose). The cheese combination was perfectly balanced. Not overly cheesy... just well balanced. Next time I'm going to change the brand of instant potatoes I used (it made the texture a little grainy) but the soup was fabulous nonetheless. THanks.

After adding the eggs and flour, the mess made me glad I used the bag. I wasn't sure about how it was going to be when done as it looked like it was going to be a very heavy coating. The only changes I made was to reduce the amount of soy sauce and to use only two eggs. The chicken turned out moist and full of flavor.  The only changes I'd make the next time I make this is omit the salt and use a low sodium soy sauce (I should have noticed the amount of sodium from the nutrition facts).

 Although these are not true English muffins as you would buy in an English  Cake shop[You cannot get them this side of the Atlantic] I would use this recipe. there is however one serious flaw in it, half way through it states. Turn out the dough and knead for a minute or two and then cut with a glass. This is extremely dangerous as a few years ago I was doing just that when the glass shattered in my hand. I was before I retired a professional cook and I have British professional qualifications.

They didn't have the  nooks and crannies that I like in an English Muffin, but if I want that type, I'll use Alton Brown's recipe (though it is more labor intensive).

I used a glass (PLASTIC one) or you can use a round biscuit or cookie cutter as well.  Anything round works, even a glass glass, which I have used for years and NEVER had one break.  Must have been a flaw in the glass Hilda used.  Housewives and bakes alike have been using glasses to do biscuits and muffins for the last 100 years.  If it scares you then use plastic.

I also veganized it by using flaxseed-water mix for the egg, margarine in place of butter, and unsweetened soy milk. I tried using oil spray instead of melted butter when frying but this was a mistake as they didn't really brown up. I also had to leave them on for a lot longer to get them sufficiently done but that's more of my fault than anything.

I have several frozen lumps of French Onion soup to enjoy for some time to come  (like tonight).  Thank you for posting this one Bill.  I usually don't say I'll do this one again but. . . . I'll do this one again.",,

I had a hard time ordering anything else but this soup.  It's a meal in itself.  The recipe is very very close to the real thing!  Rich, smooth, oniony, and the best part, the slice of crusty bread on top covered with cheese that strings from the bowl to your mouth! A MUST try for any onion soup lovers!  For those watching their salt....use the low-sodium beef broth like I do. ",,

One of the best I have had,  A nice stock recipe #80434 works well with this soup.  A long cooking time but not a lot of work to make   
Better then many restaurants

I agree completely with the other reviews about this being the best French Onion soup I've ever tasted. The French couldn't do it any better.  I didn't add any extra salt to this since I used salted butter; the flavor is outstanding.  A Hands Down favorite!",,

337657,607,2006-10-31,5,"A really good soup.  French onion is my husband's favorite, and he loved the recipe.  I omitted the bay leaf, caramel color, and the white wine because I did not have them on hand.  I used a homemade French baguette sliced and dried out in at 250 degrees in the oven for about 15 minutes.  I then added monzarella cheese on top and toasted until the cheese was bubbly and slightly browned.  I then added the bread to the bowls of hot soup.  
I do not own any oven crocks that I could have broiled the bread and cheese in, but making the cheese toast separately worked really well for me.  I also used the Swanson's broth.  With the Swanson's Broth the color was right on, so I am not sure if the caramel color is really even necessary.

Thanks for a great recipe.",,

This version did not, and I attribute it to cooking the onions slowly for a long time. Because I did not read the recipe far enough in advance, I was only able to cook them for an hour before adding the other ingredients, and I did not refrigerate overnight.  Also, I only had hot paprika on hand, so I only used half. It actually gave it a nice bite. Definite keeper!",,

I know I have to let it sit overnight to let the flavors meld, but I couldn't help getting a crescent roll left over from last night and dipping it in some soup that I didn't put in the refrigerated container :) -- so yummy.  

I made French Onion soup years ago a different way and it wasn't nearly as good as this.  I didn't add the caramel color or the kitchen bouquet, it seems to be darkish without it.  

I also halved the recipe for 8 people, but I think that if you're serving 8 you should just make the entire recipe.  It made about 4 qts of soup but if I put it in my crocks w/the french bread/cheese, they may look a little bit low.  

Just make the whole recipe and you won't be sorry.",,
416848,607,2007-12-29,5,"This soup is outstanding! I was tempted into making it after ordering a terrible FOS in a Cheltenham restaurant last night. 

I had to cut the receipe down quite a bit - used 2 very large onions, reduced amount of butter and seasoning and then one part beef stock, one part dry wine and one part Joubere beef gravy instead of the flour.  Probably sounds like a hatchet job, but it has turned out to be absolutely delicious!  Did not have to use the caramel colouring or the kitchen bouquet.  I'll be serving it tomorrow for lunch, with the bread and gruyere, and I can't wait.

IMHO, what makes this recipe is taking the time to slow cook the onions and adding a good, dry wine like Sancerre.  Thanks Brother William!!",,

Since I started making this, I have been munching on it and it's a wonder there's any left. The longer you can stand to let it simmer (it smells delicious while cooking) the more the flavours come out. I halved the recipe as I'm the only one in a two-person household who eats onions -- plus, I had just about 2.5 lbs, exactly, to use up. Another recipe I saw called for brown sugar to carmelize the onions. I gave that a shot and added about 3/4 tsp. of dark brown sugar. I didn't notice a difference in the taste. I used 4 bullion cubes in about 3.5 cups of water. When I was making the flour thickening, I added more flour than I intended and thinned it out with more broth until I got it to a consistency I liked. I didn't bother with the caramel colouring as I didn't have it on hand or thought the soup needed it. I did have to substitute provolone cheese for the gruyere, but the soup is fantastic without it too. Thanks for sharing a lip-smackingly delicious recipe.

1222621,607,2009-08-22,5,"This is wonderful.  We used vegetarian broth (Cambell's).  Up to now, all French Onion soup since we became veggies has been disappointing.  This one is thick, rich, and delicious.  Perfect! Perfect!",,
399417,607,2009-10-15,5,Absolutely the best!,,
266028,607,2009-10-25,5,Made this exactly as directed. Believe it or not the 4 of us ate it until gone! I served as an appetizer but I had to put the actual dinner I made away to eat another day because we were too full from eating the soup!,,

Definitely have this in the store cupboard ready incase you feel the same. I would also chop the bread in chunks instead of a slice, as it is hard to chop inside the soup. But overall, a lovely experience making this soup, and eating it  xx",,
1470392,607,2009-12-12,4,"This soup was a big hit and is so hip and thrifty.  We used red wine instead of white, and because we used a homemade beef broth, we needed to add a lot more salt to give it the oomph.  The long simmering of the onions is key.  And as the soup mellows into itself throughout the days, it just keeps getting better and better.",,
340533,607,2009-12-13,5,"This was voted best soup at the soup potluck dinner I went to last night (in St Louis!). I love making the large batch this recipe calls for, I freeze it and eat it all winter. I don't like lots of salt in my soup, so I make it with 32 oz of low sodium beef broth and add water for the remaining liquid. I also add 1.5 lbs of beef, cubed, and this makes up for diluting the broth. Somehow the sweetness of the soup omits the need for more salt. One thing I've noticed is that you really must scrape the bottom of the pot throughout the cooking process! Thank you for posting this wonderful soup.",,
479756,607,2009-12-18,5,I made this a couple of years ago and never rated it - shame on me! This a great soup.  I get cravings for it now and just have to make it.  I have never had the Famous Barr's French Onion Soup - but I always ate Houlihans - and this is hands down better.  I made this as directed and only made one addition of about 1-2 Tbsp Worcheswtershire sauce - this soup ROCKS!,,

593513,607,2010-01-06,5,This was excellent soup. Totally forgot to take a pic of it though. But I will next time I have it. I used sweet vidalia onions. I also had put in about 2 Tbs. of Worchestire sauce instead of Kitchen Bouquet and did not put any salt in it.  I did use the wine but I think I would like to try sherry the next time. I find it adds a little different taste. The house smells so good when this is simmering. I chose to go with gruyere cheese. Personally I find this is the perfect cheese for this soup. Delicious flavor of sweet onions and a fantastic broth. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe Bill it was much appreciated.,,
991523,607,2010-01-20,5,I have tried different recipes and this one is hands down the BEST one!  I didn't let it sit overnight and was still great.  The only change I made was cutting the recipe in half and I wish I didn't because it would have been great to freeze the leftovers.  I used the Gruyere cheese as recommended.  Thanks for a great recipe!,,

I had no white wine so I used a couple of splashes of shiraz otherwise I followed the recipe....except I added thyme and did not bother to thicken it (I don't think it needed it!).

Perhaps I just like a more brothy French Onion Soup or maybe it was a weird reaction with my cast iron dutch oven.  It was very thick and the flour was not a good addition.  The paprika was overpowering (which is saying something when it's competing with onions) and tasted off.  My 4 year old loved it and had seconds which is why I gave it two stars but sadly DH and I did not like it at all.  At any rate, give it a whirl, it's worked for more people than not.",,

1793133,607,2011-01-12,5,Wow! This soup is so amazing it doesn't even need cheese! My husband and I were licking our  bowls! I followed the recipe but did not include the caramel color or kitchen bouquet. I made a half recipe for the two of us but next time I'll make a full recipe and freeze the rest... if it makes it that long! Thanks for the recipe.,,
1884444,607,2011-04-15,5,A family friend made this soup and brought it to a potluck.  I had never had French Onion soup before and wasn't very willing to try it at first.  I was finally convinced to try a small dish and OMG I fell in love with french onion soup.  I purchased a can of Campbell's French Onion soup but it doesn't even begin to come close to how good this soup tastes.  I am glad that I found the recipe and now make it myself.  It's really not that hard at all to make.  I have a cuisnart food processor that I used for the onions & that really is the worst part of making the soup the onions.  I just made another batch today...sure it won't last long :),,
140132,607,2011-06-16,5,"This is so yummy.  I made this last night and the little girl we had staying with us informed me that she doesn't like onions.  I told her to just try it when its done and see.  Well she was licking her bowl clean AND asking for seconds!!!  This does take some time, so plan ahead, but the results are fantastic.  We loved it.  I didn't use shredded swiss, I just laid a slice across the bowl and it formed a nice ""crust"" on top.  Thank you so much for this restaraunt quality soup.",,
1934142,607,2011-06-17,0,"I have been making this soup for over 20 years and have never found another recipe that even comes close.  It is time consuming but the results are amazing.  The only thing that I do differently is, instead of mixing the flour with a can of broth, I add the flour to the paprika, salt and papper and make a roux by adding the mix to the tenderized onions.  You need to stir constantly because you don't want the mixture to scorch or brown, but you do want to cook it long enough to get the flour taste to disappear.  The roux takes about 10-20 minutes of stirring to get all the flour incorporated with the onion liquid.  After the roux is ready, slowly start adding your liquid, stirring all the time.  The result is a smooth, rich texture.  No lumps and no flour taste.  If it is too thick for your liking, add another can of broth.<br/><br/>If you're really ambitious...make your own stock!  You will notice the difference.  No ""can"" taste, more flavor and healthier too!  Enjoy!",,
1985229,607,2011-08-17,0,I believe that this recipe was created for Famous Barr by Chef Larry Ziegler. Correct me if I'm wrong. I love this soup. I used to work for the restaurant and enjoyed it many times.,,
1629974,607,2011-09-25,0,"I made this exactly as written (it really irks me when prople rate a recipe that they have not made to the letter). As an onion gravy, I would rate this three stars. As a soup, I can't rate it, as to us, this was not a soup. I read ALL the reviews so I made the full amount so we would have plenty for the freezer. I guess we just like our onion soup ""brothy"" and not as sweet- must have been the long cooking that removed the ""oniony"" taste. I guess we fall in the minority here.",,
704676,607,2011-10-20,5,This French Onion Soup is the best I've tried.  Very good and it's easy also. I've made this at least 5 times and my family goes crazy over it.  Great soup!!!!!,,
1591517,607,2012-02-05,5,"As I was cooking this, I wasn't so sure of how it would turn out.  It really coated the entire house with the smell of the soup.  I made it to freeze and was glad I did.  Had I eaten it that same day, I may not have liked it since I was kind of done with the smell.  However, after reheating and adding a toasted piece of french bread with shredded gruyere (melted in the oven), it was fantastic. I would not recommend making this for a dinner party and serving the same day.  The smell really was too much and no amount of air freshener helped.  Airing out the house with open windows was the only solution.  Still, overall, I am thrilled with this recipe!  And, it freezes very well.",,

I think the overall flavor is great but it is WAY to rich to call a soup.  It seemed just short of a port gravy, of course minus the red wine.  I really wanted to like this soup but it was SO rich; too rich to call a soup.  I did follow the recipe to a tee so I'm not sure why the rave reviews.",,

I thought of this soup and starting making it at 6:30, then I saw the directions say that it takes over 4 hours to prepare.  I cut that down to a little over an hour.  I have an induction cook top and got the onions going at a higher temp, while stirring constantly.  I added a little brown sugar to sweeten them, they caramelized nicely, then I added the salt, pepper and paprika along with the flour - cooked while stirring for a bit, then added the broth and wine.  Simmer for 30 min.  Toasted some french bread in the broiler with olive oil and a little garlic.  Served with mozzarella cheese & parmesan cheese over the toasted bread - broiled.  Delicious!",,

1584953,607,2013-01-06,2,"IMHO, this is an ok soup (gravy), but not a true French Onion soup, hense the 2 stars. I followed the ingredient list as written, but altered the cooking technique just a little. First, I exactly halved ALL of the ingredients (in case I didn't like it) and secondly, I took a tip from another reviewer and mixed the flour, paprika,pepper and salt together and put that in with the onions after their cooking time and made a roux and then added the broth. I think the total cooking time for the onions, 3 1/2 hours, is way too long, they were almost mush, and most of them disappeared into the liquid. I also thought that the paprika over-powered the onions, and gave the soup an off taste and an odd caramel color, which is why I added enough Kitchen Bouquet to try and offset that. It was more like an onion gravy than a soup. I thank you for posting, but I'll stick to my tried and true recipe.",,
1191045,607,2013-03-10,4,"This is a good, tasty soup -- but be advised -- it is not classic French Onion Soup (see Julia Child). I had never been to Barrs, so have no frame of reference. It's the paprika that makes it so different. Good, but different.",,

1800180503,607,2013-11-03,0,I followed the recipe as is only making a half batch and added a T of brown sugar to the onions after they cooked for a while in lieu of caramel coloring. We liked the thicker consistency and flavors but either the pepper or paprika made it way too spicy. Next time I will add less of both or maybe no pepper and less paprika to see how that works. Great recipe though.,,

I did not thicken- and glad I didn&#039;t, this soup was perfect without it.  To add body without thickening with flour (which leaves a goopy, pasty consistency)....use just 2-3 short pulses with an immersion blender.  This will still leave chunks of onion, but will puree just slightly and break up the longer strings of onion.  You will end up with a silky textured, rich but still thin broth.  Add the bread and cheese, and the soup will have plenty of body.  &lt;br/&gt;I also did not feel the need to add Kitchen Bouquet. &lt;br/&gt;Next time I will reduce the paprika just slightly, for good balance with the onions.  Will definitely make this again and again.",,
2542287,607,2014-06-24,0,"Amazing! I am a serious soup lover and French onion is my absolute favorite. This recipe made enough for my husband and I to enjoy (with leftover) and wound up with enough to send half to our neighbors, whose daughter had just graduated high school. I sent the soup, slices of Swiss and smoked provolone slices, a simple tossed salad and a loaf of french bread. If not for the surplus, I would have sent only a handmade card with cash (they are incredible neighbors). Variation: I had no white wine (drank it all; it&#039;s summer!) so, I used the same measurement of vegetable stock with about five dashes of white wine vinegar as a substitution. It started to get a little thick for my taste so, I added an extra cup of beef stock after the final simmering stage, turned the heat off and let sit for 30 mins. The flavor and consistency was perfect at this point. I have had soup of the same, thicker consistency that sticking to the exact recipe yields and it was great but, not &quot;bullseye!&quot;. If I have my perfect French onion, it is a little soupier; that and necessity (substituting veggie stock/ white wine vinegar) is the only reason I deviated from the recipe. I will be making this every week for lunches. I have been paying 4 bucks a bowl. I can make a whole stock pot full for that and change. Plus, I found it to be delicious enough to include in a food gift. Thank you so much for sharing. The long cook time is so worth the flavor payoff.",,

I cut Paprika in half based on a review I read here, figuring I could add more during simmer if my taste buds suggested it needed more. Also, based on comments here, I cut the flour to 1/2 c. It is still just a bit thick for my liking, especially after soaking into the baguette. But thinning is pretty easy using that magic ingredient. During simmer tasting, I felt something was lacking. It was a bit bland. After reading other recipes to see what it might need, I settled on adding Worcestershire sauce and Thyme. I added 3 generous pinches of Thyme and started adding dashes of Worcestershire, probably about 15 dashes total, and they did the trick. Don't know if the Thyme did anything, but the Worcestershire did. I know some don't like it when you review a recipe you have tweaked.

However for a more modern taste, I substituted Butter Beans for the Lima Beans (I like them, but most don't). Also, I added 1/2 each diced red pepper and green pepper, 1 diced serrano chili (adjust per your taste), 1/2 diced cucumber, 8 cloves diced garlic, and 1/2 bunch chopped parsley. To boost the flavor profile, I infused the oil with a 1/2 tsp. each garlic powder, onion powder and dried basil, combined with the 1 tsp. each salt, black pepper, dry mustard and the celery seeds. As for the Sugar, I used brown sugar (to add a little carmel to the flavor profile) for half the adjusted (1/3 to 1/2 cup) sugar in this recipe.",,

I have to admit that I cooked them in the microwave. . .yes the microwave. . .for 11 minutes on power level 7, turning half way.  They were super moist and juicy.  On top of that, they produced a wonderful chicken broth that I thickened up with cornstarch and used as a sauce.  OMG it was so good!

34969,616,2002-04-07,5,"Easy and good!  I used one jar of low fat cream cheese instead and it turned out great! Just a word of advice-make sure that you cook until the center is well set (mine was a little runny), and don't pack down the crust too much).

The combination of cereal grains and legumes (lentils in this case)supplies all the essential amino acids so that you could get all your protein from this alone.  I substituted spelt flour for half the barley in honor of the text, and also used stone ground whole wheat flour.  (Mine required quite a lot of extra water because of the whole wheat flour.)

599450,626,2012-11-17,5,"UPDATE to original review 11/12/08 under chef Sharon123: After reviewing both recipes posted under Carole Reu (who hasn't posted anything since 9/12/99) and Sharon123, I need my review to capture the complete recipe I originally reviewed, which is Sharon's. Carole's recipe isn't exactly like Sharon's and I need to note the differences so that I can continue to make the recipe I love as stated in my original review including Sharon's changes to the instructions. In my opinion these two recipes are different; however, this is food.com and I don't get to make that decision, as the food.com ""elves"" have merged these two recipes, hence my notes to self in the form of this revised review.  INGREDIENTS: ignore the 2 cups soybean flour, use 2 cups lentils versus 1 cup, and 5 tablespoon olive oil. DIRECTIONS: Step 3 - use blender;  Step 8 - place into 4 greased loaf pans; Step 9 - let rise until doubled in bulk and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour.Sharon's intro says, ""This bread will supply protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. Plus it tastes good! Prep time includes time for the dough to rise. Made during Bible times, this is a Middle Eastern bread."" Next is my original review modified for the directions: Going into this I didn't realize it made 4 loaves! If I had I might have tried to scale it down a bit. So, drawing upon the strength of Ezekiel, I made it as directed! This also didn't fit my plans to use my KitchenAid mixer - too much volume! I had to make it by hand, which fortunately was therapeutic and cathartic. If you make it by hand because you don't have a commercial appliance, triple the estimated time it takes to make! Now that I've captured my thoughts on this, I can say that I give it 5 stars because IF you can put this together, the results don't disappoint. You may just have to use your brain on this one, and your heart! Thanks, Sharon123! Made for <b>Healthy Choices</b>.",,
2002133668,626,2018-04-28,0,"I'm going to make it today. The thing is though, is that in Ezekiel 4 it mentions NOTHING about soybeans. Those are not good to put in our bodies. Why do these recipes add those in when it was never part of YHVHs orders????",,

I added 1/2 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients, based some of the other reviewers' suggestions. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients because I love the flavor. I said ""Oh wow"" when I bit into the first one. They're very flavorful, and healthier than your typical muffin. In my opinion, they taste better than ones made with white flour and sugar. I decided to check them after 20 minutes because 30 sounded long to me, and I'm really glad I did because they were just right. My oven does cook kind of hot, I think, but I would definitely keep an eye on these while they're baking!",,

I accidentally put in 1/2 c. oil, and also due to personal preference, I did end up altering almost everything, but I still feel this recipe, as stated, will be wonderful.  For pref., I used whole eggs, brown sugar instead of honey, added 1/2 t. salt and 1 t/ vanilla, and was short 1/4 c. blueberries, so added 1/3 c. fresh cranberries.  For the buttermilk, I used Saco dried (5 T. plus 1 1/4c. water.)  Because I accidentally added too much oil, I added extra flour and a bit of extra soda.  With the extra, I got 15 muffins, and baked them about 25 minutes.  I also sprinkled just a bit of sugar on the top.  We all loved them!  Next time, I may stick closer to the recipe, except use applesauce instead of oil, and for personal pref. I will probably still use brown sugar.  So, if anyone is reading this, and thinking ""whole wheat muffins - I just don't know...""  do take a chance!  This is a teriffic recipe, no apologies about the whole grain, and it can also be flexible enough to accomodate some personal preferances.",,

I've been wolfing them down and it feels good for me :) I just used 1 whole egg (instead of 2 whites), accidentally increased the buttermilk to 1.5 cups (defrosted from previously frozen cubes - great way to store leftover buttermilk!), and stuck to 1/2 cup honey. I was really thinking about adding 1/4 cup brown sugar because some reviews said they're not sweet enough, but I thought it was perfect  - a hint of honey but not too sweet. My husband would want more sweetness though. I used 1+1/4 cup of frozen wild blueberries, and that was more than enough. Spray the muffin liners to prevent sticking - a lot sticks when just out of the oven, tho it's better after refrigeration.

I don't like muffins sweet and routinely cut back the sugar 25%, so if these weren't sweet enough for me (even with 3 tablespoons of raw sugar sprinkled on top), most people will want more sugar in these. I followed a lot of other reviewers and used brown sugar instead of honey, one egg, 1/2 tsp salt, and added 1 tsp almond extract. For the reviewer whose blueberries sank, you can toss them with a tablespoon of the dry mixture and stir them at the end to prevent this. Mine were done baking at 19 minutes, but I was prepared for this, since a lot of people mentioned that (and I have never baked muffins longer than say 23 minutes).

It is important to toss the frozen (this tip may work for fresh as well) blueberries in 2TBS. of flour and let them rest for a few minutes before incorporating.  That way the blueberries will not run and turn the batter purple.  This recipe made more than 12 muffins.  My parents keep requesting that I make these again.

The only thing was that it only took 35 minutes to be very thoroughly done, so I'd check it more carefully next time to make sure I'm not over-cooking.",,
175824,636,2004-11-28,5,This bread was delicious. I also used 6 teaspoons of dried dill. This bread has a beauriful color and the texture was perfect. I sliced it and put egg salad in it. Yummy!!. I friend came over and I served it toasted with some cream cheese and butter. Delicious. Thanks Jacques Lorrain for such a wonderful recipe. This is diffinitly a keeper.,,

31521,636,2007-02-04,5,"I was looking for a recipe to use leftover buttermilk, and this is IT!!!  I baked this tonight, and it is VERY GOOD!  I made open egg salad sandwiches using this recipe, and my husband wants to have it again tomorrow night.  THANK YOU!!",,
141610,636,2008-05-08,5,An excellent recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 50/50 plain yogurt and milk. Worked wonderful but I did increase the liquid to 2 cups. A nice moist bread with great flavor. A definite winner.,,
497077,636,2008-07-30,5,"I really love this bread-one of the best dill breads I have made!!! I love the tang the buttermilk adds to the flavors. I used 4 tsp. dried dill (did not have any fresh). I made 2 loaves and added minced garlic to one. Both loaves went to making sandwiches-tunafish, chicken salad, honey ham, and smoked turkey---all were delicious!!! Thank you so much for a great recipe!!! Update: had leftovers from last loaf so I made croutons-and they are wonderful, too!!!",,
732169,636,2009-11-13,4,This is yummy! I added half a cup of shredded sharp cheddar.  I had it with chicken salad for lunch and serving it with vegetable soup for dinner. Thanks for the recipe!,,
471937,636,2011-08-13,5,"I have made this several times and continues to be a favorite for sandwiches at my house.  It's so amazingly easy, even when I don't have any buttermilk in the house I either use lemon juice in the milk or vinegar.  No matter what I make it with it always turns out spectacular, thanks!",,
1695955,636,2011-09-20,5,Oh my gosh! This bread is fantastic!!! Must try recipe,,
900992,636,2013-02-24,4,We used freshly cracked pepper and we probably shouldn't have. It was pretty pronounced.,,
30503,638,2002-07-14,4,"A very tasty spread, I was eating in sandwiches, on toast, you name it. It was a little bit too lemony in my opinion though :)",,
59064,638,2002-12-31,4,I also prefer less lemon. And so it seems does my toddler hence the 4 star rating.,,
350064,638,2006-09-08,5,"I think the lemon made this dish taste very authentic, much like my favorite all organic mediterranean restaurant. adding 1/4 cup yogurt to the food processor is supposed to make this dish even tastier although I haven't tried that yet",,
450571,638,2009-02-02,5,My first attempt at baba ganouj (is there ANY kind of standard way to spell this dish!? But I digress....) I had to replace the tahini with mayo (I read on the cooks illistrated site that this was okay) and it turned out fantastic. Thanks so much for sharing!  I will be making this again!,,
471300,638,2009-04-15,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for!  I tried another recipe for Baba Ghanoush, which was quite good but didn't taste like the one that I used to get at this Lebanese place in the town I went to university.  This tasted just like I remember and the next time I want to make Baba Ghanoush, this is the recipe I will use.",,
1352469,638,2009-08-15,0,"This recipe was nearly right on.  Having said that - it is the best I have found so far.  I would say to roast the eggplant just a little longer for that smokey flavor I love. I did 45 minutes and think 50 - 55 minutes may be better (of course it depends on the size of the eggplant).  Also, just a little less lemon juice and tahini.  I used 3 cloves of garlic and it was perfect.  Salt? about 1 tsp. Also, I put the olive oil directly in rather than use it as a topping.  Overall, this recipe is the best I have found.",,
1542048,638,2010-06-20,5,This recipe was wonderful. We cooked our eggplant on the grill. Our only change was we didn't add olive oil or scallions. There was enough oil for me with the tahini. Thank you for sharing this.,,
62264,638,2010-12-23,5,Just the best - that mayo trick mentioned reminded me of a Greek lady who added an egg yolk & a bit of heavy cream to hers.  My lemons were really sour so I added a bit less than the recipe called for.  Someday I'll be where there are Meyers lemons & I'll put them to use in this recipe. Recipe is the best - total keeper Baba recipe. Thanks Linda!,,
316334,639,2006-05-07,5," Excellent! Had to make some comfort food for my Dutch roommate and they were delicious! I'm new to this cooking nonsense so I had a few probems with ""wire rack."" Also didn't have an accurate way of measuring grams, but I winged it and they came out great! One thing though, DON'T wait too long before piping the filling in... my first batch deflated. Still tasted great though.",,
87023,642,2003-08-15,5,Just loved this recipe and it can be so versatile as I did not put  the linguine in it I used it as a gravy for a steak.  My visitors thought it was the best mushroom gravy they had ever had.  It is a definite keeper.,,
34146,642,2003-08-20,5,"Made this for dinner on Monday night, and it was a big hit! I didn't have quite enough white mushrooms, so I added some baby portobellas to make up the difference. Served it over rice, with a mixed green salad on the side. Will be adding this to my ""regulars.""  Thanks for a great dinner! ",,
50067,642,2003-09-17,5,"The taste was great, but I added portabello and porcini as well.  What I loved about this recipe was that it was sssooo simple.  It did not take me long to create a really beautiful dish.  I also added a dash of browning to give it a rich brown colour.  I served with a mixture of wild and brown rice, but think it will be even better with pasta.",,
138016,642,2005-03-30,4,We thought that this was very good.  just added a few dashes of worstershire sauce for more depth of flavor and some chopped fresh parsley for a nice contast.  ,,

Thanks for sharing!",,
327010,642,2006-09-14,4,This is one of my vegetarian daughter's favourite meal in restaurant's. .Now we can have it whenever we like. Red wine gives an even richer flavour and I think it definately benefits from the Worcestershire sauce idea.  ,,
341072,642,2007-04-20,5,"Tried it with the worcestershire sauce and I didn't have any white wine, so I threw in some Vegetable Stock (Marigold Swiss Vegetable Bouillon) instead.  Served with buttered basmati rice.  It's so easy to make .... Yum!",,

579520,642,2007-09-05,4,"Great tasty and easy to cook, if you have no sour cream try natural yoghurt instead, infact I prefer it with yoghurt than the sour cream. Enjoy",,

297913,642,2010-02-28,3,"I'm sure it's a matter of personal taste, but we weren't that thrilled.  I added some Worcestershire, but after I served my DH--I took it back and added more Worcestershire.  I also think the wine I used was too cheap, because it seemed to have a very strong influence on the dish; I'm thinking a dry sherry would be better.  Mixed the leftovers with some sauteed lean burger, onion and peas the next day--Excellent save.",,
180406,642,2010-03-04,4,"My husband really liked this but I wasn't wowed. I did add about 3 dashes of Worcestershire sauce, twice as much garlic and I let it simmer after I added the sour cream for about 15 min. I'll probably make it again but next time I think I'll look up my beef stroganoff recipe and use the spices from that.",,
2075350,642,2011-11-21,5,"I made this using vegetable broth instead of wine, and I used portabella mushrooms. It was absolutely DIVINE, and so easy! Thanks for sharing, love this one.",,
122541,643,2008-09-21,5,"This recipe has very good flavor combinations. Although I didn't follow it exactly the flavor combinations are fantastic.

I had some pre-cooked chicken and canned stewed tomatoes. 

I sauteed the squash, garlic, and threw the rosemary in too, then added the tomatos, lime zest and lime juice and cubed cooked chicken, covered and put in oven for 20 minutes. Thickened the sauce with a little flour. 

Just zest a lime with a zester- don't fuss with the matchstick cuts - we did the matchsticks and I believe a zester would be better.

Again the flavors were fantastic - good basis for pork chops too.",,

I did substitute half of the oil for applesauce and the bread was still quit moist.  I will be giving these as Chritmas gifts and it is SUCH a nice change from the typical banana bread.  :)",,
233583,647,2007-02-05,5,"Marg-  AWESOME, DELECTABLE, as DS said, ""best bread I have made in forever!"" So if I could give you 10+ stars I would.
The house smells wonderful and homey and the taste just quietly explodes in your mouth as you taste all the flavors and the textures. I cut the sugar to 1 1/3 cups for dietary reasons and it came out fabulous.  All else was followed as you wrote.  I cooked for 95 minutes at 325, (time probably increased due to the -25 degrees outside) The tops were crunchy and the inside was moist and delicious.  
I can go on and on.  Everyone should try this.  It is a keeper and will be a regular from now on!",,

I've made this before, but apparently, I never rated it.

Last time I used this recipe it was to make muffins. I left out the walnuts (I don't like 'em) and added a bit of milk (one or two tablespoons) to be able to get the batter into the muffin tins. I baked them for 30 minutes at about 375F (sorry, forgot to make a note of the temperature, so no guarantees) and they came out delicious. My sister even said that they were about as good as the chocolatey things I baked - and coming from her, that means a lot! :)

(As a side-node: my apples were pretty much regular-sized and yielded one cup of diced apple each.)",,

The loaves weren't too scant, but I will try it again with an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 and see if I like it better.  I also used granny smith apples.  I think next time, I will look for a not so tart apple.  We just bought some ginger golds at Costco and they are really delicious.  I think I'll try them!  Of course, I used the full cup oil and it was wonderful.  Had to leave the walnuts out because I didn't have them, but will have them on hand for the next time.  Mine was done in about an hour at 325 degrees, but my oven runs hot.  Time also might change if I use a smaller pan.  Marg, thanks for another great recipe and also for the specific baking time and temperature that you use!",,

The resulting hybrid recipe (for split chicken breasts cooked over an open apple-wood fire) was the absolute best grilled chicken, ever... anywhere. My guests were awestruck. Here's my modified ingredients:
2 dried red smoked chilies; 3 cloves fresh garlic; 3 oz. A-1 Sauce; 2 Tbsp. Fresh Rosemary (instead of sage); 2 Tbsp. cracked black pepper; 1 cup vodka; 1 1/2 c. apple juice; 1/2 c. lemon juice (bottled); 3 Tbsp. regular Olive oil; 3 oz. Maggi Seasoning sauce. I liquefied all the ingredients in my food processor and marinated for 4 hours, grilled the stuff over the open fire/coals and, WOW! I entered this one into my ""Secret Recipe Book"" last night at about midnite or so. And all I can say is, ""THANK YOU, TRACEY!"" (My guests offer their highest regards too!)",,

It's VERY garlicky; next time I think I'll saute the garlic in the oil briefly so it's not quite so raw. I used dried herbs and let them soak in the oil for a while along with the garlic. I was confused by the long prep time and assumed that it meant allowing the garlic to infuse the oil a bit... so I did. The bread was nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and does go perfectly with pasta, and isn't as greasy as buttered garlic bread can be. Will saute the garlic first next time, I think that might be the ticket; otherwise thought it was delicious.",,

Tortillas get nice and crispy on top. Couldn't taste the ginger, so it could easily be omitted. The cooking time was a bit short for me: the peaches weren't soft enough and the liquid didn't thicken up, but the top tortilla strips would have burned if I'd cooked it any longer. Would suggest another frozen fruit like blackberries, canned peaches or precooking the fruit part before adding the top layer of tortilla strips. A nice healthy and light dessert.

My review will be the third review. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This noodle dough was very easy to make and worked as written, although today I needed less flour. The dough is great to handle and roll out. I roll and cut all of my noodles by hand as I don&#039;t have a pasta machine of any kind, and don&#039;t intend to buy any. This made a very supple, easy to roll dough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I made two slight changes-I always knead my pasta dough for 15 minutes as it makes it even more supple, and I used bread flour, not a-p flour as written. Bread flour has more gluten than a-p flour and you can even make pasta without eggs with bread flour because of the higher gluten content. Pasta made with a-p flour will also be tougher than that made with bread flour. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I followed a new tip for the first time today: wrap the dough in plastic wrap while it&#039;s resting, and keep the resting pieces of dough in it as you roll out the rest of the dough. I have been covering it with my pastry cloth, and the plastic wrap is much better and I will do that from now on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can and do highly recommend this recipe.

1048952,749,2009-04-22,5,Excellent substitute for those heavy lasagna noodles!  Low carbers loved this one when I served it at a family dinner.  Great to have anytime!  Thanks for sharing it!,,
67656,749,2005-08-21,5,"The 2005 zucchini onslaught has begun and this was a delactable way to put that summer squash to good use.  I made a couple of substitutions.  Not in a meat mood so I used Morningstar Farms crumbles in lieu of the ground beef. Also, I used non-fat cottage cheese and mozzarella. Yes, a bunch of people are reading this and going ""ewww"" but I've been on WW Core for a year and have developed a taste for the stuff.  The dish was wonderful - rich in taste and flavor but light enough to not give you that sinking heavy feeling that you get with a traditional lasagna.  The sauce is so good, I'm planning to make it again soon just as a basic pasta topping. The 10 minute sitting time was crucial as the lasagna firms up quite a bit.  Thanks Marg.",,
237300,749,2005-08-23,5,"This was fabulous.  I made a double batch because I had some abnormally large zucchinis to use, and it was wonderful.  My son said, ""it's great, you can hardly taste the zucchini"".  This one's definitely a keeper.",,
221044,749,2005-08-23,5,"Yum!  Thanks for a great solution to the remaining half of ""The Zucchini That Ate Chicago"" (started out at 5.5 lbs, and you can only make SO much zucchini bread (smile)).  I used a full pound of ground beef, added a small can each of drained black olives, sliced mushrooms, and about 1/2 as much more of the herbs (had fresh basil & oregano in the garden). Used one small can fire-roasted chopped tomatoes, plus juice, a full 1/2 lb. mozzarella and add 1/2 cup ricotta and 1/2 cup parmesan.  Coated zucchini in seasoned flour before frying.  YUMMO!  Quite a hit - and so much lighter feeling than with pasta.",,
142200,749,2005-09-05,5,Yep...  I agree with all the other ratings.  This is a delicious recipe.  Thank you for sharing!,,
188119,749,2005-10-07,5,"Pretty good! I had double of everything except the cheese so mine was a bit more sauce and meat.  I used a can of tomato sauce instead of the fresh tomatoes and the sauce still came out quite good, just needed to cook a little longer for the liquid to evaporate.  Next time I might use both fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce.
Thanks!",,
257358,749,2005-11-10,5,"This is a great recipe and as I only had a 1 lb package of ground sirloin, I decided to double the recipe.  I added some mushrooms and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  The best part of it is that you can mix and match vegetables.  I think next time I'll add bell peppers as well.",,
289109,749,2006-01-30,5,We loved this. I made it without any meat and with crushed tomatoes which created a lovely sauce. Even my four year old was excited when she saw this and my husband said he preferred it to regular lasagna because it was lighter without the noodles.,,
235355,749,2006-02-18,5,This was AMAZING and totally rocks the house!!!  Definitely double this recipe - you'll regret it if you don't!!!  Substituted 1/2 bottle spaghetti sauce and 1 can chopped tomatoes for tomatoe paste and chopped tomatoes.  My husband doesn't eat carbs and I love carbs so we have to find compromises and this is our new favorite - I didn't even miss the noodles (and did I mention that I LOVE noodles?)!,,
211457,749,2006-03-10,5,"This was surprisingly very  good!  I used only ricotta cheese because I had no cottage cheese and I also crumbled some tofu into it to make it more nutritous.  Next time, I will try the eggplant like the others suggested. Also to  make it easier next time I will just use spaghetti sauce rather than making my own sauce.  I used one layer of ground turkey on bottom, then zucchini, then cheese mixture, zucchini, and then mozarella cheese and used a 9 x 13 dish.",,
227607,749,2006-04-02,5,All I can say is YUMMY!!! My kids who don't like zucchini loved it.  I prefer this over regular lasagna...my hubby said he liked it alot but would not go that far. He is a lasagna lover.,,

204153,749,2006-07-17,5,"This is a fine way to use fresh zucchini & herbs straight from the garden. I made two substitutions to cover ingredients I didn't have on hand. First, I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Second, I didn't have ground beef, so I used 8 oz. (weighed after baking) of Asian Style Savory Baked Tofu (#81284). I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but the flavors of the marinated, baked tofu worked very well in the zucchini lasagna. We loved this one, and I'll be making a double batch next week.",,
187705,749,2006-07-20,5,"OH my word, this was soooooo GOOD! I had to make quite a few adaptions/substitutions, though. I used a can of spaghetti sauce instead of making the sauce as indicated. I also shredded the zucchini (I have an old-fashioned grater that makes 1/2 wide shreds). I used an entire large zucchini that got overgrown in the garden. I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. It was a bit runny, so next time I think I would put a bit of flour in with the zucchini shreds. I also microwaved the shreds instead of boiling them. I would also put some crushed garlic in with it while it cooks. All in all, this is a great recipe and will be a summer staple on our dining table.",,
104295,749,2006-08-08,5,"I loved this!  I too used bottled sauce and, instead of ground beef, used cooked vegetarian sausage (that I had already cooked up with onions).  I also used low fat ricotta instead of the cottage cheese as I finished off the cottage cheese last night!  While the kids were only so-so about this, they are not huge lasagna fans.  Dh and I loved it.  It was easy to put together (my 4 year old and I put it together while dh and my 6 year old were at karate) and I love getting the extra servings of veggies in!",,
248206,749,2006-08-13,5,"Oh my God....I have died and gone to Nirvana! This was wonderful and I can't wait to try this out on company. I used modifications as one of the members had suggested with mushrooms, olives and ground turkey. ",,

I assume the cottage cheese was probably suggested to keep this a low-fat meal, but I used fat-free ricotta to keep my calories down and still get the Italian taste of ricotta. I also doubled the meat portions--because my boyfriend is a meat head...and we love us some meat.",,
446820,749,2007-02-26,5,"This was great! My hubby is South Beachin' it and he was really craving some Italian food. This satisfied his craving- he absolutely loved it! I used a little more meat than called for in the recipe (about 3/4 lb), omitted the flour (so it's SB friendly), and I subbed a can of low sodium diced tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes (just b/c I didn't have any on hand). I also added some mushrooms and black olives to the meat mixture. This recipe made four servings for us and we have made it twice in the last week! Thanks again!",,
464327,749,2007-05-26,5,I cut the recipe in half since i knew it would only be me and my mom eating it (picky brothers don't know what's good). I really really REALLY liked it and it was soo simple. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because i prefer it.  This is definitely a new favorite!,,
331817,749,2007-07-16,4,This was really good.  Even my husband and in-laws who aren't south-beaching-it loved it.  I did feel like I needed more zucchini than it called for but that was no big deal.  YUMMY!,,

227652,749,2007-08-06,4,"This turned out good! I made one serving-used about 10 slices of zucchini. I used my own marinara sauce & for a kick, chopped up 4 slices turkey pepperoni into the mixture! I used about 1/4 cup reduced fat cheese, omitted the flour & added some seasonings to the marinara sauce. I also used lean ground turkey. Very easy, and very fun to mess around with! Didn't even miss the noodles! Thanks for sharing this.",,

I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I used an ""ice cube size"" of homemade pesto instead of the other spices.  And nonfat ricotta instead of the cottage cheese.  I also sliced a few tomatoes for on top of the lasagna and sprinkled just a small amount of mozz over that.  Thanks for the post!  I will make this again!",,
506426,749,2007-09-16,5,"Very, Very good!  I made it exactly like the recipe and this satisfied our craving for pasta and wasn't heavy.  Very tasty.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 pan.  Oh yes, I also topped it with a layer of sliced tomatoes lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese. 

I did salt the meat sauce while cooking which brought out the flavor more and lightly seasoned the zucchini slices with salt and pepper. Like another reviewer said, I sliced the zucchini lengthwise to have more of the appearance of noodles.

711073,749,2008-02-22,5,"This is a great recipe that even my kids love.  The couple things I do differently though is for one, I do no cook the zucchini first.  I find it gets over cooked while baking.  And the other thing is that I also use ricotta instead of cottage cheese. To me, the cottage cheese tends to make any lasagna too watery.  It's definitely all personal preference though!  I've also added fresh spinach in a couple layers and my kids STILL love it.  Great way to get vegetables into them!",,
696989,749,2008-03-26,5,"Very worthwhile, hearty, and tastey!  I used ground round (soy protein) and also added a layer of spinach.

Doubled or more the garlic which I always do. Thanks for  the recipe.",,

This is a great way to use zucchini (and get DH to eat more veggies).",,
512532,749,2008-08-13,5,WOW...this is really delicious. I added more garlic and meat and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of cut up tomatoes. I needed to add more water because the mix was too thick. But  it was SSSOOO good. My family loved it. Definitely slice the zucchini lengthwise. It's easier to layer over the mixture. Plan to make this often. Better than using noodles and much healthier!,,

So husband had a few bites and announced:  I LIKE THIS!  Hey, after 14 years of marriage when he says it like that, it's a five star recipe.

Let's just say I topped it with the tomatoe mixture and cooked as usual. 
I sauteed my zucchini ( in Olive Oil) and I used more then stated but no need to drain. I also used crushed red pepper instead of black pepper. I didn't have an excess of liquid at all- never a need to cook the tomatoe paste mix either. A very forgiving recipe and absolutely wonderful.

I doubt I would have liked it so much if I followed the recipe to a T- especially the cottage cheese part (not a fan!). I took some tips from other chefs and made some modifications. Used fresh basil, fresh thyme, low fat ricotta & mozzarella, ground sirloin, and grilled eggplant as the ""noodle."" I also doubled on the garlic and used some to saute along with the onions & beef. I hardly cook meat without seasoning so I seasoned the meat with Adobo & black pepper before cooking it. I think it's important to season to your tastes. Since the beefy sauce is what really makes the meal, taste as you go along before baking it. I added ground cayenne and some more dry Italian seasoning to get the beefy sauce to the right spice for my tastes. I like how the recipe called for fresh tomatoes because using canned might have been too salty. It just had a fresher taste that way. I even topped with red pepper flakes when it was done (I like spice!). Next time I make it, I'll try it with zucchini. Oh I almost forgot! Definitely use the full 1lb of beef for the 4 servings.

I pretty much followed the recipe, other than adding an extra tomato because cottage cheese here is mainly curds (the Germans eat it on bread so it can't be runny) so I thought that would help it from drying out and adding some cayenne pepper instead of normal pepper.

1282091,749,2009-07-13,5,WOW!!!  Best lasagna ever.  I made it last week and my family is asking for it again tonight!  The zucchini is an awesome substitute for noodles and one of us is severely allergic to onions and this recipe worked out great!  BRAVO!!!!!,,
810787,749,2009-07-22,5,"We really liked this. Since I have to incorporate carbs into my diet I did put some of the no bake lasagne noodles in the layers. I omitted the riccotta/egg mixture because my husband doesn't like it. Plus I used the tomato mixture from Penne Pasta with Tomatoes and Cheese since it was left over from earlier in the week. Even though I added things, we LOVED it!",,
352271,749,2009-07-24,5,"With zucchini overflowing in my garden, this looked so tempting that I just had to make it!  This is the best Zucchini Lasagna I have ever made or had anywhere, and that's a compliment!",,
729254,749,2009-07-25,5,"Very, very good! I used lowfat ground turkey, extra garlic and spices..YUM! I have to also say that you do not miss the pasta at. Use a mandoline slicer for uniform and thinner slices that seem even more like pasta!! So good!",,
280619,749,2009-07-30,5,"I would probably add a little sugar to the meat sauce (unless you are on the low carb). I like my sauce to have a hint of sweetness. Otherwise, very easy and good.",,
758140,749,2009-08-03,5,"GREAT!  This was a ten star recipe.  I used 1 lb of italian seasoned Honeysuckle white ground turkey, but also added the spices it called for.  I also used a little more tomato paste and cheese since I had a lot of meat.  It was so good, and I think I like it better than noodle lasagna.",,
1346638,749,2009-08-09,5,"Fantastic!  Being Italian and being on low card lifestyle, pasta is what I miss most of all.  The recipe is so easy and delicious.  When slicing the Zucchini I kept the cutting board at an angle over the sink and the excess moisture drains off the Zucchini.  I opted for Ricotta cheese since I cannot stand cottage cheese.  A word to low-carbers:  Whole Milk Ricotta cheese has less carbs than the other ones.  When I came to the final step of adding the top portion of cheese, I added a light sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on the top as well.  It browned very nicely.  I used 1/2 lb of beef and for a variation next time will make it a cheese lasagna (minus beef).",,
308765,749,2009-08-12,5,Loved this - made it with broiled zucchini but micro would have been easier.  Used the 1 lb ground beef plus ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Next time I'd make a double batch so I have more than one serving leftover!  I also agree to double or triple the garlic.  Yum!,,
1087830,749,2009-08-13,5,"Using low fat cheeses, this is quite healthy, and really delicious and filling!  5 stars most definately!",,
777453,749,2009-08-13,5,"Absolutely wonderful! I loved this and my husband loved it and my 2 year old as well. I used low fat ricotta and I used lean ground turkey. Also, I used jarred spaghetti sauce and added tomato paste to it to make it thicker and I did add the herbs you listed.. I tried a recipe like this in the past but it was nowhere near this good! This one is well put together and very yummy!! I've never made lasagna with noodles, and I never will, Thank you!!",,
493276,749,2009-08-16,5,"I was recently put on a ""yeast free"" diet and lamenting my loss of lasagna... until I found this!! It was amazing, I didn't even miss the noodles. And my picky husband ate it up. It was enough for 2, plus some for lunch the next day. Thanks for a great recipe.",,
1356661,749,2009-08-18,5,"I am on a low carb diet and found this ..my hubby made it for me tonight for dinner.. used 1 lb ground beef, 2 garlic, 3 zuchinni and 8 oz mozz and the ricotta.. YUMMY!!",,

I made this Lasagna this week and it was wonderful. I didn't even miss the pasta. My husband also loved it. I did use Ricotta cheese because my mother used Cottage cheese once as a child and we hated it and it stuck with me, and it can curl. I also use 1 lb of ground beef and chopped up two hot sausages. Added extra on all the spices and garlic, husband loves garlic. There is so much you can do to this receipe. We had leftovers the day after and it was even better. Will make again, thanks for sharing.",,
683972,749,2009-08-31,5,Yum! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and substituted TVP for beef. Turned out really well if a bit messy.,,

169166,749,2009-09-30,5,"Super good!!! I used a mixture of ground pork and ground bison, light ricotta and light mozzarella. It all fit perfectly in a 9x9 pan. I am passing this on to everyone I know. After all, tis the season for Zucchini's!",,

462637,749,2009-10-17,5,"Divine, tasty, outstanding! What I like the most, my 17 month old daughter loved it! I adapted it to what we like and don't (i.e. no cottage cheese). I also added chuncks of zucchini to the meat along with mushrooms. Definitively a keeper!",,
817046,749,2009-10-20,5,"I've done this recipe more than twice now, tweaked or as it is... my DH loves it all the time.  Even brought some to work for lunch! thanks for this lovely recipe!",,

684761,749,2010-01-08,5,5++++ stars!  I LOVED this recipe. The leftovers (hardly any) were incredible.  I followed it to a T and it was delicious.,,
1517373,749,2010-01-10,0,"This recipe is good, but will be much lower in carbs if the cheeses are full fat and the tomato sauce is sugar free and omit the tomato paste, as the sugar in the tomatoes concentrates in the paste.",,

I did the original measurements to keep it low-cal, but I added more garlic and Italian seasoning to the meat and sauce.  I had to add more water to the sauce to even get it to boil, but it turned out beautifully.  Next time I may try grilling the zucchini.  Thank you for posting, I will be sharing this with many!",,
440324,749,2010-02-21,5,"I cannot believe how delicious this dish was. I used  3/4 lb of ground beef, part skim ricotta, 8oz bag of part skim mozzarella as well as whole wheat flour. It was to die for. Next time I might skip the pre-cooking zucchini step since I like a little bit more texture, but that's just a personal preference. This one is a keeper for sure!",,
176398,749,2010-03-28,5,Great recipe! I ended up using about 3/4 lb of ground beef and for the cheese mixture used some part skim ricotta and fat free cottage cheese. Thanks!,,

It's always nice to eat something that has been modified from the ""norm"" or how it is traditionally made and not notice a difference. Due to our personal tastes I added parsley to the cottage cheese mixture, rather then using fresh tomatos I used a 15oz can of diced tomatos, and double the amount of herbs used in the dish due to Marg's comment about it being slightly bland. Thank you so much for the recipe, I will definately be making this again and will recommend it to others. :)",,
1375896,749,2010-04-21,5,"This is so good!  We definitely did not miss the pasta!  I used 1 lbs of ground beef, double the spices, and added salt.  Before the salt the meat was pretty bland.  I used ricotta because it had slightly less carbs than the cottage cheese I looked at.  Also, I used a colby-jack blend because I'm not a huge mozzerella.  This is definitely a keeper!!   I am going to post it on my facebook right now  :)",,
345731,749,2010-05-07,5,"This was really good! Didn't miss the pasta at all. I doubled the beef (to 1 lb), didn't bother with the flour, and used two to three times as much water while simmering (added in increments). I had some ricotta to use up, so mixed it with the cottage cheese. I prepped in advance and stuck it in the fridge for a couple of hours before baking. Turned out perfectly!",,
640474,749,2010-06-06,5,"This is a great recipe for me as I enjoy lasagna but I'm very picky about pasta. I did not pre cook the zucchini and it was perfect.

761650,749,2010-07-15,4,"Awesome base recipe, but made for tweeking.  I doubled the beef, a must!  I also doubled the seasoning and garlic.  I used about 3 medium zucchini, (on top of sauce) sliced about 1/4"" thick to line my baking dish boiled them a little so they would cook faster, seasoned with S&P.  I did the cheese like in the recipe but it was really not enough compaired to all the meat in the sauce so I doubled that but I used ricotta cheese and seasoned that too.  I added a layer of fresh basil leaves on the cheese.  Layered the sauce and zucchini but on top of the last layer I added fresh mozzarella cheese.  Let me tell you I could have eaten the whole tray.  Will double to a 9x13 next time, definetly!!  THANK YOU!!  Just started a low carb way of eating and couldn't come up with anything.  Now I have this.",,
2001228894,749,2017-11-03,4,"Nice easy quick way to get a lasagna like dish. Only caveat as an Italian American I say USE ricotta please..it give any lasagna dish authenticity, better flavor and texture. Fresh basil adds more flavor too.",,
1317616,749,2010-07-19,5,"This is more than delicious!! I doubled the meat, used all ricotta cheese, shredded fresh mozarella, and a few more zucchini than listed. I also took a small portion and cooked it without the meat for myself(I cooked everything according to the recipe but just left out the meat). My husband and two year old loved the meat version and I loved the vegeterian version. Absolutely yummy! I will definately make this again!! Thanks!",,
1640071,749,2010-07-27,5,Made this last night!  I used venison instead of ground beef.  It was delicious!!!  Definately will make again.,,
1156663,749,2010-08-31,5,We ALL LOVED this!  I used turkey & hot turkey sausage   smoked mozzerella.  Also added in fennel seed & crushed red pepper.  This is now part of the family collection - Thank you!,,
738916,749,2010-08-31,5,"Amazing! I just finished making 5 of these lasagnas to freeze. It took about 3 hours to make that many, but it used up a ton of zucchini and the family loves this dish. Thank you so much for sharing!",,
246292,749,2010-09-09,5,This is by far one of my favorite finds on Food.com!  My husband LOVES this lasagna!  And I love that it is made without the noodles.  Delish!  We make this at least 3 times a month.  I also served it to guests and they raved about it.  Thanks Marg!,,
546021,749,2010-09-27,5,"Wow, I think I like this better than ""normal"" lasagna!  It's tender and sweet and just plain delicious!  (I used garden combonation Ragu instead of the sauce that was called for, 1/2 lb lean ground beef and 3 zucchini.)  My picky toddler LOVED it!  Thank you for a terrific and healthy recipe!",,
441525,749,2011-01-10,5,"I made this today and it was super yummy!  My husband gave it a A .   I only made a few changes.  I used 1lb of ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also didn't add the water.  I grilled the squash on the BBQ just for a few minutes on each side.  I also added some green bell pepper to the sauce. Oh and I doubled the oregano, basil and thyme.",,
666682,749,2011-02-20,3,"This was a good recipe. I grilled my sliced zucchini before concocting my lasagne. I used ground turkey, doubled the meat, and the cheese mixture as well as the herbs and garlic. Next time I make this, I think I will add an onion bechamel as the top layer to add to the richness. Thanks for a good base recipe.",,
1622913,749,2011-03-23,1,"I'm sorry but I did not like this at all.  I'm a big time low carber and love Italian dishes, and love zucchini normally,  but this just didn't work out at all.  I even grilled the zucchini but instead of blending in, it stood out and never blended with the other ingredients, tasting like grass for some reason.  I followed this recipe exactly, except for adding 1/2 tablespoon of garlic instead of just the mashed clove.  I did end up eating around the zucchini but I still wasn't thrilled.  Sorry.",,
1301961,749,2011-04-09,0,"Made this tonight and it was great! I  zapped the zuch in the microwave for 2 mins to save some time, used some  marinara sauce from a jar instead of fresh tomatoes, and used ricotta and everything came out great. Thanks for the recipe!",,
1732352,749,2011-04-23,5,"This was great! Definitely going to make again, I don't even miss regular lasagna! Both my roommate and my mom were surprised at how good it was and asked for the recipe. The only change I made was I used jar sauce and added extra cheese, it still turned out great.",,
800776,749,2011-05-11,5,Finally a guilt free lasagne recipe :-) Made this twice already and really love it! Thanks Marg!,,
448004,749,2011-05-24,5,Great reciepe!!! I ended up going with the no boil lasagna noodles (which I highly reccommend) instead of the zucchini slices. However I did use the zucchini.  I grated 3 zucchini and mixed it in with the tomatoes and seasonings.  I did add extra garlic and I did double the meat. After that I went accordingly to recipe.   My family and I loved it!  The kids (ages 7 and 4) did not notice that there was veggies in it!  Wahoo! :) Score!,,
1061020,749,2011-06-18,5,It is a keeper. Needs more cheese and zucchini.,,
38643,749,2011-08-07,5,"OMG, this is excellent.  Other than doubling the garlic, I didn't change a thing.",,
320427,749,2011-08-25,4,I made this recipe exactly as written and really liked it.  My DH requested that next time I layer in traditional lasagna noodles since he didn't feel it was real lasagna witthout noodles.  But we both really enjoyed the taste of the zucchini in the lasagna which we had never thought to try before.,,
126440,749,2011-10-15,5,Great little dish.  I used 1/2 lb. each beef and sausage and used fresh homemade ricotta cheese.  Very good and have a little leftover for lunch next week.,,
502302,749,2011-10-17,0,I used this recipe as a springboard. I had my own meat sauce leftover from spaghetti and I made a modified version of the ricotta using soy (see my recipe Recipe #324948)<br/>Funny thing was that 5yr old realized the zucchini when hubby didn't! We did notice it being watery though and that was with precooking the zukes. Hubby suggested keeping in the noodles. I may use the uncooked noodles that you can get that cook right in the dish. That way they could soak up the extra liquid.,,
2036918,749,2011-10-18,0,"I have been low carb for almost a year, and will tell you zucchini lasagna is a fantastic addition to the meal lineup.  You can use any lasagna recipe and substitute zuch for noodles.  I use a cheese slicer to make strips of zuch, boil them a few minutes in a big Texas skillet, dump the water then very lightly brown them in a little butter.  Season the strips with garlic salt and onion powder and they won't be bland!",,
560664,749,2011-12-28,0,"WOW!!  My husband and I were IMPRESSED!   Absolute winner with this one!<br/><br/>I had made up too much meat and veggies, I added celery too.  So I had to add more moisture but instead of water I added a mixture of beef broth and milk.  Other than that, I followed it to a 'T' and it came out great!  Thanks for the recipe!!  :)",,
563726,749,2012-01-02,5,"Awesome lasagna. I like this much better than regualar lasagna and it's so much lighter. I made two changes: I did not cook the zucchini before layering it and it turned out just the right texture- not too soft but not raw, and I added one small can of tomato sauce to the beef mixture. Delicious, thank you!",,

1986928,749,2012-06-04,5,"Wow! This was a huge hit with my guys.  It was so hearty and delicious, they didn't even care that it was full of veggies and free of pasta.  The zucchini on top made for a great presentation.  I didnt measure my zucchini, but I think it was a bit more than called for.  I also used vegetarian beef crumbles, which worked perfectly with this recipe (and are a healthier option for those looking to avoid red meat).  I bookmarked this one, and I'll definitely be making it again.  Thanks!",,
564647,749,2012-07-12,0,Fabulous! I was craving lasagna and hade a huge zucchini inmy garden. I used a can of Hunts spaghetti sauce in a can its only 1 dollar and added some more seasonings. Used Italian sausage instead of ground beef! Fabulous!!!,,

I doubled the meat per Marg's suggestion though I used 1/2 lb burger and 1/2 lb hot italian sausage.  For cheese layer I use grated low-moisture mozz and other ingredients as directed but also added chunks of fresh mozz as little surprises. Thumbs up, Marg.",,
1609319,749,2012-08-16,5,"We have made this meal sooo many times and it is fabulous. We personally like it best when the zucchini is shredded in the food processor, then has as much water as possible squeezed out of it ( by squeezing handfuls or wrapping in a tea towel and pressing the heck out of it) then cooked in the microwave for 4 mins. We used the low fat ricotta, and used some Ragu instead of all the separate ingredients for the sauce. We do add all the herbs though because we like it to have a stronger taste. Sometimes we add some chilli powder which kicks it up a notch. We also add some mexican cheese, along with the mozarella, to the top which gives it a yummy crust. Fabulous recipe...thanks so much for posting",,
1179225,749,2012-08-18,4,"This recipe is a really nice change form regular heavy lasagna. I didn't miss the noodles at all.

2888306,749,2013-07-07,0,"To start I used a 9x13 pan, I increased the amount of all the ingredients. I used Pomi strained tomates, they are low in carbs and I used one can of tomato paste. In the sauce I added a blennd of italian seasonings and I used garlic paste in the sauce. I sauteed chopped onions, fresh garlic and mushrooms in a small amount of olive oil. Once those were partially cooked I drained them and set them aside. I used 2 lbs of meat, ground beef and spicy italian ground sausage. I cut the zucchini in long strips about 1/4 inch thick and quickly balcned them in boiling water. I also used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta cheese. Made the layers as the recipe instructs and baked it. About ten minutes before it was done I added a blend of italian cheese to the top. It was really good!",,

I didn&#039;t pre-boil the zucchini and I doubled the entire the recipe. I also used Hunts traditional sauce for my base. This recipe is truly inspirational. And I am so glad I gave it a shot. We loved it and I will definitely be making it again and again.,,
1800071363,749,2014-02-06,4,"I used this recipe as a jumping off point for an AWESOME 5-star lasagna.  I gave the recipe 4 stars because I changed almost everything about it, lol :)  So I have no idea how it would have tasted if I had followed the directions.  I don&#039;t eat red meat, so I used a pound of ground chicken and browned it with onions.  Instead of making sauce from scratch, I used an entire jar of Newman&#039;s Own marinara.  To boost the veggie power of the dish, I added a about a cup each of shredded carrots and roughly chopped baby bella mushrooms to the sauce (after sauteeing them in the &quot;drippings&quot; from the chicken &amp; onions).  I let that simmer while I prepared the rest of the ingredients.  DO NOT STRESS about slicing the zucchini super thin.  The thinner pieces did not hold up very well and the thicker pieces were nice to bite into.  I used 4 whole zucchinis, - including the outside edge pieces - and sauteed them with a little bit of olive oil, salt/pepper and chicken stock.  I could have eaten those alone.  For the cheese, I mixed equal parts shredded mozzarella and shredded sharp cheddar into the ricotta/egg mixture for a bolder flavor.  I also added about a half cup of thawed frozen chopped spinach and a touch of chicken stock with salt/pepper.  Next time I might try a little lemon juice and/or zest for zing.  After layering the ingredients I refrigerated the whole thing for a couple of hours because I had to step out and that was totally fine.  when I got back I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 then sprinkled the rest of the mozzarella/cheddar mixture on top, fired up the broiler, and seared a it to a nice crispy finish.  It was delicious!  To avoid getting too chubby by wolfing down all that cheese at once, I am planning to serve the reheated leftovers on a bed of sauteed shredded zucchini, mushrooms, and spinach tonight.  Bon Appetit!",,

I made this one the other night, and it was AWSOME I used 5 zucchini&#039;s cuz they were on the skinny side and about 8 or 9 inches long. Had my hubby slice them on the madolin( I cause harm to myself with that thing!!). I layered it like a traditional lasagna 3 layers, I also seasoned the egg/ cheese mixture with S/P, parsley and italian seasoning.

I had shredded 5-Italian cheese on hand and I was a bit more generous with the cheese mixture, and the cheese on top. My husband does not want me to change a thing, but I think next time I&#039;ll use bottled spaghetti sauce, since it could use a bit more seasoning, and I always have that on hand.",,

I did not have enough ricotta cheese and I did not want to buy more (I kind of felt like it would be too much cheese since I was using shredded cheddar and shredded Mexican blend cheeses.)  I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes which was seasoned with garlic/oregano/basil, and a garlic/basil/oregano spaghetti sauce instead of the listed spices as those two items had all the spices needed for a tasty dish.  As well, I layered the bottom of the pan with zucchini and then proceeded to do the layering. This was a very easy dish to make and so so delicious.  You can&#039;t go wrong!",,

Substitutions:
I used an additional zucchini.

I used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb of each Italian sausage &amp; maple sausage.&nbsp;


I used an extra can of tomato paste for the consistency I was looking for. 


I used a block of cream cheese instead because I didn&#039;t have any ricotta or cottage cheese on hand, and it was so amazing. My husband preferred it to the cottage cheese/ricotta.

After putting it in the baking dish, we decided ours needed more veggies to complete the second layer so we were able to use some pre-steamed leftover veggies from a frozen mix we buy including yellow and orange carrots, and red bell pepper.

The first batch was a little sweet for my taste, so I halved the sugar and may decrease more or eliminate it in the next batch. One thing that helps prevent the mixture from being too liquid is to press the tofu before using it. To press tofu: place 1/2 lb. (the weight before pressing) of  tofu between towels and put some weight, such as a plate or dish, on top of it to help express the liquid; 15 or 20 minutes of pressing is usually sufficient.

This is an excellent compromise for me. I did make several changes because of my dietary needs: I omitted the sugar (though I could use stevia) and vinegar, and instead used lemon juice for the vinegar.

I&#039;m not sure how convincing, to me, it would be on a mild sandwich like turkey.  Maybe with a more intensely flavored meat like salamis or ham.

I make a few small (but worthwhile) changes, first, I sautee chicken breasts in a little oil and butter, then shred or cube the meat, add the BBQ sauce, and let it simmer to absorb the flavor. Then I use Green Giant Mexicorn (with red pepper) to save time. I do not put the cheese or lettuce in the black bean/onion/tomato mixture, it just gets soggy, for each salad, I put down a layer of lettuce, then the corn/bean relish, then chicken, then dressing, and top it off with the cheese and olives. Lastly, I ALWAYS serve it in a flour tortilla shell bowl! Just place a burrito sized flour tortilla in a metal (or other oven proof) bowl of appropriate size, (prick it a few times to prevent bubbles) Or use a tortilla shell bowl form which is what I have.

4177,809,2000-12-27,5,"While on my first visit to Ireland in July 1999, the birthplace of parents, my cousin and I stopped in Doolen near the Cliffs of Mohr and had this marvelous dark Irish Beef Stew cooked in Guinness Stout""  at O'Connors Pub.  It was absolutely delicous and the first authentic Irish meal we had and while all the food was great there was nothing that could beat the Irish Stew.  When I found the recipe on this site, I immediately tried it and it is exactly like what we had in Ireland.  When my cousin came to dinner and I served it, he was sure I had gotten the recipe from O'Connors Pub while we were in Ireland.  It was a cinch to make, directions were very easy to follow and it practically cooks itself.  It is equally as good over mashed potatoes or rice.  Try it, you'll like it. The one ingredient I added was a ""wee bit of blarney""",,

My original recipe called for fresh thyme and no rosemary. I add three stocks of thyme while it cooks and then add picked thyme leaves at the very end as well as the parsley.

I made a few modifications to initial recipe- I used the whole bottle of Guiness (< 2c), 1c of beef broth, fresh rosemary instead of dried as that was what I had, about a pound of carrots, and added 5 potatoes, peeled and diced. I browned the roast initially and cooked the onions in the pan with the oil and bay leaves like the recipe stated but I then placed the whole roast in the crockpot to cook (not cut into chunks) and shredded after it cooked- just fell apart easily. I put all ingredients in the crock pot and let cook on low for 8 hours. Wonderful flavor and many compliments!! People that don't like beer even loved the taste as the guiness was not overwhelming.

Rolled each into a ball, put each ball between parchment paper and rolled out. Great recipe. The second time I made this I substituted the flour with King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour and it tasted great.  Kind of nutty.  However, the dough was more difficult to work with.  Next time I may just do half four and half whole wheat flour.  Thank you.",,
758761,820,2008-11-12,5,Quick and easy to make.  Loved the taste thanks a bunch!,,
850664,820,2009-01-22,4,I made this with soy milk because I can't drink regular milk.  I didn't have any problems rolling it out after refrigerating the dough for an hour.  This crust is more brittle than ones made with shortening or butter and reminds me of a very light shortbread.,,
964030,820,2009-03-07,5,I love it!! I use less salt and add sugar instead.,,
500671,820,2009-03-08,5,"Great, didn't change a thing.  I used the chill and roll b/t two sheets of cling wrap and it rolled out perfect!  The pickiest eater in my family couldn't stop talking about this crust.  :)",,
324621,820,2009-04-27,5,Worked out great! Although I used olive oil...will use this recipe again for when I make Chicken Pot Pie.,,
206354,820,2009-05-05,4,"I have used this recipe many times, and just now remembered to review it!  Love it, but we cut the salt.  I never take the time to chill and roll; just pat in the pan for a nice bottom crust.  Thanks.",,
1000315,820,2009-11-01,5,"This was fantastic! I usually use a lard/hot water crust for my awesome apple pie, but  recently I've been trying to find healthy alternatives. This did the trick! The crust came out crumbly and perfect.",,
126037,820,2009-11-09,5,"This was really an amazing crust.  No, it's not your typical butter-flaky crust, but it was quite good.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and 1/2 white flour, plus I added 1 T vinegar for flavor.  I did have to add quite a bit more milk, and rolled it between wax papers, but it was pretty easy to work with.  I made Recipezaar #45070 Pot Pie, but used beef instead of turkey , and it was awesome!!  Thanks for the healthy recipe.",,
440590,820,2010-05-17,5,"I cut this recipe in half for use with a ham and spinach quiche (#147160 here). I didn't even attempt to roll out the crust, and instead just pressed it with my fingers into the pie plate. Baked it for a bit at 375 to set it before filling with the quiche. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.",,
1601422,820,2010-06-09,3,Came out pretty good but doesn't act like your usual pie crust.,,
2368767,820,2012-08-19,5,"This worked out way better then i thought, i did what other reviewers suggested and placed it in the fridge for half an hour or so and had no problems rolling it out,  i also placed 1tsp of sugar and 1tsp cinnamon because i was making a banana cream pie. I will be using this for my pie crust from now on!",,
1396874,820,2013-08-22,5,I&#039;ve made this pie crust several times now and will keep using it. I substituted unflavored COCONUT MILK for the milk and it came out great. I rolled the dough between two sheets of non-stick parchment paper and had no trouble. I didn&#039;t even have to refrigerate the dough first. It was quick and easy.,,
2000105818,820,2015-07-30,4,"Flakey, butter, and soo good. I make this all the time when I make chicken pot pie and it&#039;s a hit everytime. A little hard to work with and roll out but is better when chilled a bit. This is my go to recipe everytime :)",,

They came out so soft and yummy and smelled so good while baking. My family absolutely loved them and DH declared them to be even better than the usual applesauce cookies I make.

Norma offered any two of the following additions to these yummy cookies; 6 ounces chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, or peanut butter chips; 1/2 cup coconut, any variety; 1/2 cup raisins; 1 cup toffee chips; or 1 cup chopped nuts. My DH's favorite is a chocolate cake mix with chocolate chips and chopped walnuts added. They taste almost like 'brownie' cookies. Yum. Thanks for posting.",,

I baked them 2 minutes longer than recommended and kept them smaller sothey got a little more crispy around the edges.  Going to frost them up with plain vanillla frosting.  Will add lemon peel next time.  Have also tried chocolate with mini chips - wonderful.  Previous review --Made with spice cake mix, walnuts and toffee bits. This one is as easy as it gets. Was worried that they might be a bit too cakey, but they firmed up nicely and did have a little crispness on the outside after cooling. Will try again with some of the other combinations suggested by other reviewers.

Something about adding the jam I think is what takes away the somewhat traditional ""frozen fruit"" taste.  I scaled it to 1 serving and used a frozen berry blend.  (Which had blackberries and rasberries in it so added seeds but I don't mind.)  I also used strawberry all-fruit spread instead of regular jam to cut down on the sugar and the calories.  I didn't find that it needed any more milk.  Actually I was surprised at how easily it all blended.  I was worried it would be too thick but it was not.  Nice dessert drink.",,

I mixed up the spices as stated and sprinkled evenly over the fish then I flipped them over and repeated with the same amount of spices. I put the pan in the fridge for an hour, added 1/4 cup white wine and baked uncovered for 25 minutes. I let the fish sit for several minutes then I sprinkled 3 tsps of lemon juice over the fish. DELISH!",,
57222,825,2006-05-19,4,Very quick and tasty! I used saithe fillets. (Saithe cooks quite quickly - mine were done in just over 15 minutes) The spices were subtle - you couldn't really tell which spices had gone into the mixture but the overall flavour was lovely. Thanks for sharing!,,

569012,825,2007-12-08,4,This fish was very yummy! I added some chopped preserved lemon to bring out the lemon flavour a bit more!,,
194993,825,2008-12-06,4,"Boy, was I ever skeptical. I kept thinking this was gonna be a waste of tilapia. WRONG. It was simple and quite tasty. The changes I made were to add more oil to the marinade and then brushed it onto the fish, then put some garlic on top of the fish before baking. It didn't need nearly 20 minutes. I served it with some fresh sliced rye bread and some brussels sprouts. Yum.",,
214116,825,2009-03-01,5,"I made this exactly as instructed and it was amazing - my boyfriend immediately requested it be added to the regular rotation. I served it with plain old carrots, broccoli and sweet potato - wonderful health meal with great flavours. Thanks for posting!",,

I used 385 ml carnation milk, 2 1/4 cups brown sugr...and followed the directions....it was bubbly around the edges but same jiggily accross whole pie.  I did make this in a round  pizza deep dish pan,  but if using a tart pan with removeable bottom I would suggest placing on a cookie sheet also.  I used my sweet short cheesecake crust....Yummy smooth, not runny works out perfectly...also left out at room temperature for days and crust dosent get soggy, and still great.... This is almost like butter tarts or pecan pie filling... only no raisins or nuts...",,

4470,834,2001-08-21,5,I love hamburgers and I love this recipe! This is so easy and comes out very tasty.  I wanted a tad more sauce so right at the end I added an oz of vodka mmmmm. Thanks for a really good recipe,,
16334,834,2001-08-23,5,"This sauce is so yummy, and the aroma is wonderful. I cooked 3 rump steaks instead, and doubled the sauce mixture, using small, frequent amounts to fry the steak in (and to put on top of the steak as a quick marinade), then using the bit left over to spoon over the steak and fried rice I made. I also used soy margarine instead of butter, dijon mustard and 1 freshly squeezed orange, because I ran out of lemons.",,

I made triple and it was just enough for the two of us.  Use Grey Poupon mustard.  This is easy to make and well worth the effort.",,
22023,834,2001-10-24,4,I really enjoyed this recipe.  I always need something new to make with hamburger meat.  It was sooo easy to make and it tasted wonderful.  And one of the bet parts was that I had all the ingredients.  I served it with greenbeans and mashed potatoes.,,
13483,834,2001-11-05,4,I paid attention to all the comments about making more sauce.  I fully understand why they were made!!  I love lemon anything and I added a bit more lemon than called for and it was delicious.  This is a recipe well worth doing again!!,,

29196,834,2002-03-24,5,"Thanks to all who suggested doubling the sauce. We put a couple of tablespoons of minced onion in the meat mix, and cooked the patties in a pan sprayed with oil.

35193,834,2002-05-18,4,"I agree with Gayle. More Worcestershire next time. I may even try Bergy's ounce of vodka. Like Clifford Boren and Cas, I used Dijon mustard and took Jan's lead adding minced onion to the beef. It was good and my husband liked it, too. Next time I will use thin cuts of beef instead of ground round. And I don't know why, but the sauce kept breaking. I got it to hold long enough to get it to the table by whisking in some sour cream. Oh well, I'm learning. : )",,
25455,834,2002-09-12,2,"It is quick to make--an easy recipe to make, but I thought it ended up rather ho-hum.  I didn't find the sauce all that flavorful and it was on the greasy side with all of that butter.",,
54424,834,2002-09-12,4,This hamburger was good and quick.  Frying the burger in the mustard and butter gave it a good flavor.  Next time I will double the sauce as indicated by others.  I will use it again.,,
55729,834,2002-10-14,4,"My family liked this. I have been making Steak Diane for years, but I had never thought of using the flavors with hamburger. I doubled the sauce, but unlike the reviewers, I didn't think it was necessary, and would make the recipe as is next time.",,
58546,834,2002-10-23,2,"Ehhh... it was very greasy in my opinion, even with extra lean burger. The taste was good, but I'd skip the butter and just mix the mustard, lemon, worstershire, salt, and pepper directly into the meat. ",,

Unfortunately, the ground chuck was a little greasy for this recipe, which was my fault for not having the required meat in the recipe, but the taste was still pretty wonderful! I will make this right, the next time!  I, too, doubled the sauce and was glad I did!  These were just fabulous...minus the grease!  Thank you so much for posting this!!!  :-)",,
78960,834,2003-04-03,5,"GREAT recipe!!!!  Absolutely, at least double the sauce...I actually tripled it, because I am a ""sauce person.""  I also cut down a little on the mustard, and added about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  This is a fantastic, easy recipe to make, and quite easy to tailor the sauce to your own particular likes or dislikes.  Would be really hard to mess up!",,

84160,834,2003-05-06,5,"Fabulous!  I made this last night, and we couldn't get enough of it.  Taking the advice of the reviewers, I wanted to double the sauce.  When I removed the meat to add the mustard, I also added about a cup or so of milk and a little bit of flour.  The mixture thickened immediately and stretched all that yummy meat flavor even further!  I'm a garlic lover, so I sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on the patties as they were cooking initially.  I also served it with garlic toast.  QUITE YUMMY!",,
60231,834,2003-06-17,5,"I liked this very much! Right up my alley. I did mine in my huge electric skillet - had no problem with anything burning.I bought ground sirloin because there was no ground round put out at the store and I didn't want to cal and wait. Doubled the sauce - Kiddo ate hers plain with catsup, and The Husband and I had ours on sesame sandwich buns with no additions. Delicious!
This will be a good one for when grilling season is over.

108291,834,2003-11-01,4,Very good!... I also used dejon  mustard and thought it had a good flavor.  My family wants this dish to be on our normal to have list.  Will make it again once in awhile though...calories and fat content do not lend this to be a normal weekly meal.....,,
55578,834,2004-02-26,4,"Very good.  I accidently threw everything in at one time,but it turned out anyways.  I added minced onion to the ground beef and then added a sliced onion while the burgers were cooking.  Nice change of regular burgers!",,

103628,834,2005-05-17,4,"These were good.  I added onion soup mix, and next time I think I'll leave it out.  Also, I wasn't happy with the ground beef I used--an organic brand, and it had a lot of crunchy bits.  Yuck.

So for us it didn't look that great but tasted fabulous. I took the advice of past reviewers and threw some minced onion in my patties and I doubled the sauce. I doubled everything but the butter, it just seemed ""greasy"" enough. Next time I would probably triple the sauce. I served these with Ranch Potatoes # 103929. Great simple meal!",,

For my husband and I, I served it over a bed of spinach with a little bit of the sauce and sliced avocados on top. He loved it. My kids, who just ate it as a hamburger patty loved it too.  It was quick and very easy - so we will definitely be having this again.",,
111347,834,2006-05-05,4,"I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was great.  The sauce kept seperating despite my best efforts to keep it together, but I loved it nonetheless.  Thanks for sharing!",,
289319,834,2006-09-28,4,I wonder if some of the grease problems were from using higher fat meat?  I used ground chuck and cooked the burger a little before simmering them in the sauce.   That helped with the excess fat in the meat.  I still had to removed some excess fat from the finished sauce but that was easy enough.  I would actually trip the sauce next time but I used 2lbs of meat.  I also think that adding some breadcrumbs and onion to the meat would be great.  That said we all liked the flavor of the sauce a lot!  Great variation on a staple in our home.,,
181792,834,2006-12-05,4,"These are very good.  I'm not much on plain hamburgers, so these were nice and flavorful.  I made them with ground turkey to deal witht he grease problem that some members had.  I made them according to directions one time with 2-3 times the sauce, and it was good, but the next time I took someone else's advice and mixed everything together.  I ate them on a bun without anything else.  Very good!",,
619248,834,2007-11-03,3,"While certainly simple and tasty -- I think it is worthy of praise between 3 and 4 stars.  I thouroughly enjoy burgers -- grilled and plain,  and this was a nice change of pace.",,
199657,834,2008-05-03,3,"I did as one reviewer opined and just mixed the sauce ingredients into the burgers themselves.  I enjoyed the flavor, but because I had to hold dinner in the oven while awaiting my DH from work, they weren't as juicy as I would've liked. I omitted the butter and added garlic and onion powder.  They were good, but I suspect that sauce on the side wold be much better.  Next time I'll try the recipe, doubling the sauce, as written, except maybe adding a little grated cheese into the burgers or making them a bit meat-loafy--something to make them more tender and juicy.",,
138435,834,2008-09-17,4,"This is a very enjoyable way to eat hamburger.  I don't care for hamburgers overly much, and if I eat them I want them dressed up somehow.  I really like the sauce on these.  It elevates a plain burger into something more.  After reading the other reviews I also doubled the sauce and let it run into the rice I served alongside.  Yum!",,
777092,834,2008-09-29,0,"This didn't work out for me like it did for everyone else.  Boo hoo!  I'm wondering if it's something that I did.  I followed the directions.  I had to cook mine for quite a bit longer as the insides were still very raw.  I do like medium rare.  So, I stopped at medium rare.  It did have great flavor.  But, the sauce just looked gross and was all separted. The pictures posted were so beautiful!  I'm going to have another go at this but take someone's advice to add flour and milk to make more of cream sauce instead of such a greasy sauce.  I did cook the patties a bit to pour off the meat grease before I began with the sauce.  Thanks for a great start!",,

The second time, I VERY carefully watched the heat, and they still burned!  The heat was so low that I ended up finishing the meat in the microwave, which I've never had to do before.  I had to throw out the sauce AGAIN and just made a gravy.  But I could tell from the flavor on the meat that it was delicious, so I'll refrain from giving it any stars until I can figure out how to make it without burning!",,
440568,834,2010-01-12,5,Delicious!  I added garlic powder along with the salt and pepper before making the patties.

I found that 1 tbsp of sake was simply not enough to massage300 grams of chicken thigh and used 5 tbsp.  I put the chicken into a ziplock bag poured in the sake and massaged it into the  chicken through the bag. let it rest for 30 minutes and found there was none left to drain off. I mixed the dry spices (used  1  1/2 tsp paprika - amt not  given in the recipe) in another zip lock bag added the chicken and tossed until all the pieces were evenly coated. Instead of deep frying I pan fried the chicken in 3 tbsp oil - fantastic, crunchy on the outside and moist inside.  The flavor is very mildly curry but unless you knew it was in there you would be guessing. It is a lovely combination of flavors and will not bite you.  This recipe is one that I can't wait to make again Thanks Recipezaar or whom ever the original chef was that posted this recipe",,

131388,860,2005-09-11,3,"This would have gotten 5 stars, but 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt is a bit much for only 1 1/2 cups of flour. We used the stated amount of salt the first time and the 9 biscuits were just too salty. The second time we used 1 tsp and they were still a bit salty. We think 1/2 tsp might be better (compare amounts of salt in other biscuit recipes). Otherwise, the biscuits were great! (I will ask if the 1 1/2 tsp of salt is a typo.)",,
54067,860,2005-11-15,4,"These were very tender and had good flavor but I agree with an earlier review about the salt. They were very, very salty . next time I will cut the salt by more than half. Raised up really light and high.",,
239694,860,2005-12-03,5,"Yeah baby! This is the one. the ingredients are basically similar to other recipes, but the gentler mixing by hand makes the difference I think.  Yeah, your hand will get gloppy, but it's kind of fun to mush it up.  Very light and fluffy inside, nice crispy outside, perfect texture and flavor.  I was thinking of using butter flavored crisco, but I used plain instead and am happy with that choice.  I also cut the salt to 1 tsp.  I made 6 good size biscuits.  OK, so maybe making perfect biscuits isn't the answer to life's larger dilemmas, but it makes a hell of an egg and cheese sandwich!",,
222433,860,2005-12-11,4,Very nice flavor. Will definitely make again. I also cut the salt amount at the suggestion of the other reviews. Thanks for posting.,,
244815,860,2006-01-13,5,Great biscuit recipe! Crispy on the outside and flaky inside! Great jam crevasses! Thanks for sharing!,,
124249,860,2006-02-17,5,"This biscuit had a nice flavor and the crunchy outside that I like. Reminded me of  my Mom's biscuits. I served this with sausage gravy on top. 
I liked the easy preparation for the dough. It seemed a little quicker than the way I usually mix my biscuit dough.

Thanks Ron&Joyce.

245323,860,2006-03-01,5,These were delicious! I also cut down on the salt and grated frozen butter into the mix instead of shortening because I find that makes them very puffy. I added some bacon that I had left over from breakfast that I chopped into little pieces along with some grated cheddar. I added about a quarter cup more milk and a touch more baking powder to make up for this and they cooked about 5 minutes longer. I buttered them and served alongside some Manhattan Clam Chowder and they were so goooood! Thanks for the great and easy recipe!,,
183684,860,2006-03-02,5,You've just replaced my tired old biscuit recipe!! I did they that they were a bit salty so next time I will cut it back to 1 tsp. Other than that they were perfect.,,

341437,860,2006-08-11,5,"Great taste!  I cut the salt down to about a 1/2 of a teaspoon and there was no problem with excessive saltiness.  I used butter flavored shortening, and the result was amazing.",,
3205,860,2006-08-13,5,"Great recipe. This will become my homemade biscuit recipe from now on.  When I first made this, I wasn't sure how they would come, considering the mixing.  Mixing the dry ingredients with liquid first and adding shortening together.  They were the best.  I must admit the first time I added melted butter on top after they came out of the oven because I thought they would be bad tasting.  Oh my, were they delicious, hubby loved them.  Next time I made them, no butter, just as great.  They just melt in your mouth.",,
329251,860,2006-08-13,5,"Great biscuits! I used a 2 1/2 inch cutter, so I got about 6 biscuits out of the dough. They were soft and buttery. I also took a little of the shortening out, and added butter. Soft and melt in your mouth!I brushed butter over the tops right before they came out of the oven, so they browned up nicely. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks so much!",,
337472,860,2006-08-24,5,These turned out good even though I ended up using olive oil in place of the vegetable shortening (I was all out of shortening). I was surprised at how well they turned out. I did decrease the salt to just a pinch. A nice change from my usual biscuit recipe. ,,

I wasn't sure how they would come out, because the milk was being added to the flour before the butter had been incorporated into the flour. The only thing I changed was I only used 1 teaspoon of salt and I didn't have reg. milk that day so i used the heavy cream and 1/3 cup of butter the results were amazing!!

They are wonderful, light, great texture and IF you have any leftovers they keep well...Thank you for sharing.",,
191050,860,2007-03-25,1,"Sorry- we just thought these were dry, plain, and tasteless.  My DH is usually polite, but even he made a negative comment about these.  I made them almost exactly as stated (the only change I made was to cut the salt in half) so I'm not sure why we weren't as thrilled as the other reviewers.  Anyway, thanks for sharing, but we'll just have to keep looking for that ideal biscuit recipe.",,
291235,860,2007-03-26,4,"These biscuits are kind of ridiculous. In a very good way. 

They were were huuuuuge, heightwise, and very, very light and fluffy. Very nice texture.

My usual biscuit recipe calls for both shortening AND butter in the mix, and I kind of missed that in these, but the texture/height is probably sacraficed when using butter...  

Either way, these are GREAT, and I'm definitely keeping this recipe at hand.

Didn't have any shortening...did have butter in the freezer! Lopped off about a 1/3 cup and GRATED IT (large hole) into the flour. Easy...effective...excellent.

My poor biscuit skills almost got me, but when I turned everything onto the floured counter and started kneading, it came together almost magically!  It really does make exactly 9 biscuits.

Seriously, I could hardly eat them and I followed the recipe exactly.  My boyfriend even commented on the salt.  I will definitely be reducing the salt to 1/2 teaspoon next time, but I will make them again because other than that they were perfect.  They rose very high, were light & crumbly, and had a wonderful consistency.",,

You don't notice the salty taste if you make a sausage biscuits or dip them in gravy, but if you eat them with jam (or anything sweet) you really notice the overabundance of salt.",,

Found they work just as well if you roll them into balls and flatten them a bit, and that way you get the 9 and they'll be bigger. Only complaint I have is that we found them to salty. They've got a great fluffy texture though. May or may not make them again. Good alternate when you're out of butter.",,
1277915,860,2009-06-03,4,"Great flavor! I really loved the test, however they were a bit too thin. They were perfect for crumbling up and pouring gravy over, but it would have been hard to cut them to put sausage or anything inside. I'm not sure what I did wrong.",,

This recipe is easy to handle, and makes up a great looking biscuit!! The reason that I can't give it 5 stars is because they are quite salty in my opinion.  Next time I make them... and there WILL be a next time, I will skip the sugar and half the salt. 
I used butter flavored shortening... and yum, yum!!",,
622972,860,2009-11-02,4,These were good!   Mine turned out thin though.  But I had a schedule issue and had to let them sit before cooking - I am sure that is what caused it.  I used only 1 tsp of salt after reading other peoples reviews.,,

I also used a bit more ketchup, 2/3 of a cup.  I used 2 cups of boiling water from the start and added more after about 5 hours of baking and some more again later.

50969,897,2007-03-04,4,"Since I'm such a wimp when it comes to spicy foods,this is how I made these very good burgers.For the taco seasoning I used 2 Tablespoons of Recipe#105993,2 ounces of the green chilies,and about 1 /3 cup chopped sweet onion.Mixed lightly until all the ingredients were comined didn't want to dry the meat out.I pan-fried for about 6 to 8 minutes on each side,when the burgers were almost done I added a slice of pepperjack cheese to each burger pattie.Topped with my favorite toppings,and served this with Recipe#32015 which made a great a ""Burger & Tater Night"".This will be made again,thank you for posting.""Keep Smiling :)""",,

Delicious! Not overpowering at all , just the right amount of tingle. I made the whole recipe, we ate two for supper and put the other two in the freezer. Will be making these again, thanks for posting.",,

I was to lazy however to make them into patties so I crumbled the burger up and fried it like sloppy joe meat and added all of the rest to ing. the meat after it was cooked 1/2 way.  Ate it like a sloppy joe  on a bun.  THIS WAS EXCELLENT!  We ate with sliced tomato, sour cream and shredded mexican cheese blend. I will be making this again.  You can have so many toppings you can choose from with this burger!! Lettuce, tomato, all the different cheeses, jalapenos, salsa, avacado or gucamole, sour cream,  even a cheese sauce if you like mmm mmm good. thanks for posting.",,

13483,902,2001-08-16,3,Very easy to make for a lunch.  I served it cold as a sandwich.  I found it a little too bland though.  Next time I make it I will add some cheese (like blue cheese or sharp cheddar),,

homemade ice cream.  Yummmmmmmmmm",,

22724,916,2002-08-14,5,Now this was just FUN!!  Fantastic recipe...tasted like I was at the fair.  Kids went NUTS over them and were begging for more!  Very easy to make.  Next time I think I will go all the way and make lemon shake ups too!!  Only problem I had was my funnel opening was too small for the batter...but we compromised and used something else.  They still turned out great!!  (I will be buying a bigger funnel though!!)  Thanks for the great recipe :),,
52863,916,2002-08-21,5,I made these today and they are as great as the ones you get at the fair.  EXCELLENT!!!,,
72633,916,2003-03-01,5,"Oh my Gosh!  They taste exactly like the fair.  I'm the cook of my family and I'm the fourth child of 8, so this was fun to make because i love to cook and because everyone loved them.  This was a fun recipie to make.  Here's a tip: make sure the oil is hot but not too hot, or else they might brown very dark real fast.  A way to tell if the oil is hot is to wet your figertips with water and splash the oil.  If it boils immediatly, then the oilis hot, and if it takes more than 3-6 seconds, then you should let it heat a little longer.  Good Luck and Enjoy!  Also try Lois's Lucious Layered Fudge, Recipie #55153.  Enjoy!",,

I looked up this recipe.  The batter was way too thick, and wouldn't pass through my funnel, so I had to pour it from a cup, as thinly as possible.  It did not work very well, so I tried thinning the batter with a little extra milk.  That just seemed to make it thicker.  The 'cakes' turned out very thick and doughy.  I think I will try again with a different recipe, because this one was very problematic.  Sorry!",,
223729,916,2005-06-18,5,i was feeling happy so i made this here funnel cake and it was awsome.,,

255338,916,2006-09-21,5,"No matter how hard I tried, I could not get my funnel cakes decently shaped. With a smaller hole, they turn out thin and crispy, with the larger hole, they were thicker and more doughy. My kids prefer the softer thicker cakes. I dusted ours with icing sugar, and they were gone within hours. Thank you for sharing.",,

448669,916,2007-02-11,5,I work at a nursing home and do the activities one thing we do is try new recipes.  The residents love these funnel cakes and look forward to when we mix up and cook a batch.  We are going to try making the dough red and make them heart shaped for Valentines Day  We put them in a zip lock bag and cut a small hole in it easier to clean up than a funnel just throw the bag away,,

337963,916,2007-10-19,3,"As the stars say, we liked this recipe.  I believe it has great potential, it's quick, easy and satisfied a late night craving.  But as many of the five star reviews point out, it does need a little tweaking.  The flavor is bland, next time I will add some vanilla and increase the salt a little.  Also, the batter is too thick, needing more milk.  I used peanut oil to fry them since it has a higher smoking point than vegetable oil, and I mixed the ingredients together in the blender.  I used a ziplock bag with a corner cut out for pouring as there was no way the batter was going through my 1/4"" funnel.  Rather than using water to test the heat of the oil as one reviewer suggested (that made the oil pop and splatter, next time I'll test it with a bit of batter.  That way I can adjust the ingredients as needed. Thank you for posting the recipe as we did enjoy it.",,
541070,916,2007-10-20,5,"My husband, 2 sons (10 and 8), and I thought these were really good!  I followed the directions exactly.  They would taste bland if eaten alone, but once you add the powdered sugar, they are great!  My husband thought they tasted better than the ones from our state fair.  I definitely agree with one post about NOT using water to test the oil.  It splatters like crazy.  Also, using a funnel does not work.  As with another post, I used a ziploc bag with one corner sniped- worked like a charm!  We will definitely make them again!",,

It was a little messy, but I have no funnel or spare ketchup bottle. Sandwich bags are dispensable and convenient. That said, kids loved it - it served way more than 6.

I reduced the recipe to 2 and still had leftover batter which I saved and will try that to see how well it holds up.  I used a funnel inserted into the top of a baster tube (no bulb) for better control and it worked well.  I used a medium sized cast iron skillet which gave just the right size per cake and reduced the  amt. of the oil.  I hand whisked the whole thing which I prefer to do when possible.  There&#039;s no oil temp indicated on recipe... I started on high and reduced to med. high but this will vary according to your stove.  Too hot will turn edges dark, too low and it absorbs too much oil before browning.  I&#039;d err on the side of too little batter per fry versus too much which end up with one big, solid cake.  Will follow up with success of using leftover batter for a second round.  All in all, I thought this was an extremely good sub for commercial funnel cakes and would definitely recommend and will repeat.  Oh yes, dusted with powdered sugar just like the fair vendors do.",,
1800120872,916,2013-10-13,5,"I honestly never knew funnel cakes are so easy to make.  And, it&#039;s just as the others have said.  These really do taste just like the ones at the fair.

2219083,916,2013-10-31,4,"The recipe was easy to follow, batter was smooth, the funnel cake had a nice soft crunch when you bite into it and then a bit soft in the middle. The only complaint I have is that the funnel needed more tast. Maybe if I added brown sugar instead of white sugar and vanilla extract it would then give the funnel cake more tast.",,
222564,916,2013-12-17,5,Very nice and fun! Like a deep fried waffle. I increased the salt to 1 1/2 ts and there is much more dough than for 6 servings.,,
1802667973,916,2014-04-14,5,Great Recipe! It brought me back to the funnel cakes I had as a child. I used a deep fryer and it worked just great. Thank you for such a great one!,,
1802871392,916,2014-06-30,5,"Delicious. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 eggs seemed a little high, so I subbed 2 egg whites for one egg yolk; fried in canola oil. Health food!!  Guessed on temp by dropping little bits of batter in until they cooked in a reasonable time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tried with powdered sugar on one and cinnamon and sugar on the other. Really, really good either way. Next time I&#039;m going to add a little vanilla to the batter, and maybe a little cinnamon if I&#039;m going the C&amp;S route, see what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had a condiment bottle laying around - a messy pour, but it worked just fine.",,
1802904066,916,2014-07-07,4,"Incredible taste, easy to make. Only issue I had was the batter was pretty thick so I had some issues pouring it from my funnel. Perhaps next time I will use a little less flour or more milk. I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars because the thick batter was really the only issue. Even with that, the cakes came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and nice and light just like funnel cake should be.",,
1802978190,916,2014-07-29,3,Needs more sugar and vanilla in the batter to be 100% but a pretty good recipe and easy to make.,,

Light, not too sweet and they cook so quickly they&#039;re not bogged down with oil. The kids devoured it and I still have batter left. Hoping the batter works well tomorrow, otherwise I&#039;ll be forced to eat all if the cakes next time.",,

It didn&#039;t turn out as sweet as I thought it should be (compared to the old fair funnel cakes..from what I remember). Then again, I haven&#039;t had one in years. But other than that, this recipe is very tasty. Also, it came out crunchier than I expected. Maybe I left it in the oil too long. I did about 3 mins on each side so if u don&#039;t like it as crunchy, I would shorten that time. Thanks for this yummy recipe!!",,
1800071984,916,2015-06-14,4,Way too thick. It would even go into the funnel. So I added 1 cup of very warm water and mixed it again. After that though it came out perfect and just like the fair.,,
2000316314,916,2015-07-04,5,Okay! I did not have a funnel and I cut this recipe in half (I only had two people eating funnel cakes and still had a LOT OF leftover batter!) I used a sandwich ziploc and just snipped the tip of a corner! This recipe was very simple and VERY tasty! Only issue I had was I squeezed the bag too hard and got batter EVERYWHERE. lol lesson learned: get a funnel!,,

2001186357,916,2016-09-30,5,So easy to make and so delicious! I absolutely love this recipe and it's always a huge hit with everyone. I got a medium sized funnel from the car parts department at a store. It smoothly goes through the funnel to make perfect cakes. Just add a little extra small splash of milk if the batter seems like it may be a bit too thick.,,
384041,916,2016-10-02,0,Wow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had no idea how easy it was to make funnel cake. I made them for a bunch of college guys and it was universally agreed that they're just like the ones from the fair or the race track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The batter was a little too thick to flow through the funnel though. I had to trickle it from a measuring cup. It makes a lot of 8&quot; servings. A LOT. After the first time I've always added a little vanilla to the batter.,,

677508,930,2012-05-21,4,I liked the consistency of the baked beans but I'm used to a sweeter version.  So I may add a little bit more brown sugar next time or use molasses.  I did my bacon in the microwave too and just mixed the bacon crumbles up in the beans.  I cut the recipe way back since I was just making them for 2 of us so they baked/set up quicker than the full recipe.  Went great with the turkey pepper jack hotdogs we had for lunch today.  Will make again.,,
140132,930,2013-02-07,5,I made this last night to go with the meatloaf I made for my guys.  I halved the recipe as there wasn't many eating last night and it was wonderful.  These beans are simple to prepare and I alway have the ingredients on hand.  Thank  you for sharing with us.,,

This recipe is so easy to make and so good I did not know what""blackuce heat"" meant but just put it back on the stove and simmered it for 5 minutes. I used skinless boneless breast but followed your recipe (cooking time was shorter).Great blend of flavors that complimented each other perfectly.  Thanks Dancer for another great recipe",,
27783,931,2004-04-19,5,"Mmmm Mmmm good.  The marinade is very flavorful - I liked the currant jelly and the ginger especially. I used a nice Valpolicella (medium dry) red wine in this.  I let it soak in the marinade overnight.  The thighs came out very moist and tender.  The one thing I would do differently next time is to make an extra batch of marinade to serve as a dipping suace, because I enjoyed the flavor so much.",,
60260,931,2004-04-27,5,"Nice flavor!  I had some boneless, skinless thighs in the freezer and decided to give this recipe a try and it was a success. I made it as it. Everyone enjoyed it but since we aren't huge thigh fans I think I'll try it out on some breasts and see how that turns out.",,
51109,931,2005-02-13,4,"I made this last night and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The thighs were tender and juicy and the marinade/basting sauce had wonderful flavors.  I made it using orange juice instead of chicken broth and I think I'd like it even better with the broth.  The sweetness of the marinade needed some saltiness to balance it, and the broth may have provided that.  Next time I'll try either the broth or a bit of soy sauce.  I'll be making this a lot, and can see using it for a great appetizer with thighs cut in chunks and skewered before grilling.  I, too, would make an extra batch of marinade to use as a dipping sauce.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.",,
418366,931,2008-10-19,5,"Absolutely delicious!  My wife and I both loved it.  I did it exactly as the recipe directed, using orange juice. Next time I am going to try it with cornish game hens.",,

10437,932,2001-09-23,0,"I always mix my dressing ingredients together first before adding to the entire dish.  For instance mix the mayo, salt, pepper, horseradish together first in a small dish.  If you are usign small pieces of onion and celery too then add that in as well,  Then mix all of that with the potatoes.  It spreads all of the dressing ingredients better throughout the salad.  Tastes better faster.  Although it is always better to let it ""sit"" a bit before serving this helps speed up that process.",,

I have never used dijonnaise mustard - only Dijon or Spicy Brown.  I have cut the mayo by 1/2 cup as the recipe measurement is simply too much.

256906,958,2007-01-29,3,"First of all, this recipe needs some clarification.  It lists ""zest of one orange"" when I believe it is supposed to be ""juice"" of one orange.  I prepared the zest of one orange - which is the finely grated peel, and added it as the recipe called for in #2 of the instructions.  Then I noticed it mentioned juice in line #3 which made sense because after adding the dry ingredients the batter was much thicker than a cupcake batter should be.  I then added the juice from the orange I used for zest.  I don't think it affected the end product much though and it had a very nice orange flavor.  Incidentally, one batch equalled 12 cupcakes for me.  I will probably try again using juice instead of zest and most likely double the recipe.",,
32143,958,2007-08-16,4,Really good and easy! My daughter just dumped the flour and baking powder on top of the butter mixture and it mixed up fine. I used 1/4 cup of orange juice instead of zest. Frosted with Betty Crocker Whipped Frosting. Yum! Would have been 5 stars with clear instructions.,,

-I prepared it just as posted and it was fantastic. 
-For a vegan alteration: I doubled the amount of tomatoes and olives (using kalamata in addition to the green). We didn't even miss the feta, but I found that it could be sprinkled over or mixed into the salad at the time of serving and it was even more delicious.

I also used dried dill and added some extra as posted and it turned out wonderful. This is such a great refreshing salad to have for lunch.

I had thought about increasing the garlic as I was whirring away, but decided to stick with one clove and I am glad that I did. The resultant flavor is light and delicious and garlic doesn't overpower the rest of the ingredients. Truly a fabulous marriage of flavors!",,

98626,970,2004-10-05,3,"This isn't exactly my favorite potato recipe; here's why. When I shook my potatoes in the Ziploc mixture, mostly the flour and only a small amount of parsley and cheese clung to the potato slices. I was thinking to myself, ""now what do I do with all of my expensive, freshly grated parmesan,"" which was still in the bottom of my bag. So, I sort of heaped the remaining cheese mixture onto the tops of the potatoes in the baking dish. Once flipped over at mid-point of cooking time, the cheese, now on the bottom, formed a hard, baked crust that wasn't really very good. I will say, though, that the potatoes smelled Grreaat! while baking. It does seem worth it to try the recipe w/o the flour, so I can really get the cheese on there.

I absolutely love this sauce recipe.  I have been using it almost every week since my first time and look forward to my homemade pizza like never before...because it tastes so good.  I especially love combining this sauce with Culinary Judge's #51209 dough, which has also become my favorite.  It is so very easy and so very good.  The only changes I make is that I always use twice as much water as the recipe calls for and 2 or 3 times as much fresh parmesan cheese.  I let the sauce simmer while I make the dough which creates a lot of heavenly flavor in the sauce.  If you haven't tried this sauce please do...I promise you won't regret it.  I'm hoping this recipe gets more exposure...it should have many, many more reviews! It is wonderful! It  definitely should be a  keeper in everyone's cookbook who loves pizza.",,

The sauce was a too sweet for our taste, so I'll need to make some modifications for our personal preference next time.  I added pepperoni and olives ~ YUM! BTW, this was my first time making PIZZA (&DOUGH)!  I wish recipe poster mentioned that you need to allow to foam in STEP 1.  I had to discard my first dough as it had not risen in 2 hrs, and I was getting too impatient.  Also, I took another poster's recommendation and cooked pizza dough for 5 MIN prior to adding sauce in order to avoid a ""soggy"" pizza.  Do this but~~~ PIERCE dough so it can steam.  Mine ballooned in oven but then settled down when I immediately pierced once I took out of oven. I then added sauce, cheese, and toppings and cooked for 15 minutes. ENJOY!  This is a REAL GOOD ONE OVERALL!!!",,

I followed the recipe for both the crust and sauce as written, taking Marg's suggestion and using half wheat and half white flour, a little garlic powder in the sauce and all olive oil. I meant to prebake the crust but forgot, and it was still cooked through and crisp on the bottom. This was a very generous amount of dough for a large 16 inch pizza pan. Great flavor in both the sauce and crust. I was a bit worried the sauce might be too sweet, but it was right on. Just a tip, I always coat the pizza pan with a decent amount of olive oil, and sometimes add cornmeal for texture before pressing out the dough. Thanks, Marg, for a great recipe!",,

We used wine and added a dash of garlic powder.  Topped the pizza with veggie pepperoni, onions, baked garlic, spinach and cheese.  Next time I think that we will cook the crust a few minutes before topping it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe- this is the best completly home made pizza we have made.  Will make again for sure.",,

My husbands friend helped me with the dough because it was sticky and I had to add a lot of extra flour to make it work right.  I used all purpose flour but no wheat flour.  The pizza turned out really good.  The sauce is so good I think I'll use it for marinara sauce sometime.,,

First of all, I use a bread machine, so it's not much work.  I also put some ground flax seed in with the flour which makes it a freckled dough, and that works fine.  I have been using about 1.5 pounds of mozarella for the pizzas that this one recipe makes.  I have one pretty large pizza pan for 1 pizza, then use the rest of the dough to make 2 small pizzas on a cookie sheet.  I've frozen some of the large ones, and they take 30-35 minutes to cook, straight out of the freezer.

I thought I should have used less flour but it was perfect.  The bread flour makes for a very tender crust and this recipe does not disappoint.  I also baked one pizza on my pizza oven (the rotating one) and one in the oven. PERFECT! This truly is a recipe worth trying and keeping.  I also found out that this dough does refrigerate very well so it can be made in advance and just taken out of the fridge for the second rising.  It is also best to let the dough rest for a few minutes after putting on pan before putting on the ingredients.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I did not use the recipe for sauce as I had my own.

About 4 days later I defrosted it and made another pizza, and it was just as good (actually better) than the first!

216664,1005,2008-02-11,2,"Thanks for sharing the pizza sauce recipe, Marg. I cheated and used Pillsbury's refrigerated pre-made crust, which worked well. I doubled the recipe for the sauce and used 1/2 cup red wine & 1/2 cup of water. Unfortunately, my family didn't care for it. The wine was over-powering and my step-son thought it was too sweet. Even so, it was fun to eat while we watched the Grammys. Thanks, again!",,
587114,1005,2008-02-15,5,"I just made the dough and used marinara sauce, talk about easy! I have never liked my own pizza dough, but this here is the exception! And I used all wheat flour as that's all I had. There's no way this would serve 16 at our house - we got two smallish pizzas that were finished off by myself, hubby, and 3 boys under 7. As a side note about the foaming yeast, for me it was hard to tell when it was foamy because of all of the water. I just let it set a little while, maybe 15 minutes, and had no problems whatsoever with it rising. Can't wait to make this again!",,
596235,1005,2008-03-06,5,"There is nothing like the taste of homemade pizza dough, and pizza sauce. This is one of my faves! Although I make mine a little bit more spicy using chili powder. mmm mmm mmmmm",,
135470,1005,2008-03-09,5,"I just made the dough which was straight forward and easy to work with. I mixed one and a half batches all at once  in my Cusinart, taking less than a minute to knead. I use half unbleached flour and half King Arthur white wheat, and olive oil. I followed other's suggestion and cooked the crust 5 minutes before topping. The crust was firm and flavorful, and  a big hit with our whole group of family and friends.",,
500905,1005,2008-04-12,5,"Excellent!  Absolutely wonderful!  I, too, made the crust with the half white/half wheat and thought it gave it nice body.  I may go 3/4 white and 1/4 wheat for friends who don't like that ""wheaty"" taste.  I did mix mine in the bread machine on the ""dough only"" setting, which made it even easier.  The crust was firm and crispy.  I made mine in 2 rectangular foil cake pans (12x8) and put the second in the freezer.  The whole process was incredibly easy.",,
211521,1005,2008-04-20,0,"OK.  The BEST sauce. Really great taste.  I have a good deep dish crust, but my sauce wasn't very good.  This one was very simple, cooked for about 15 minutes over med high, then finished over low.  Perfect.",,
522177,1005,2008-04-26,4,"Fantastic! I made the dough in the morning, pre cooked the dough for 5 min and  covered it.  I came back before supper and did the rest. We also used 1/2 and 1/2 flour. It was very tasty! My family has lived though many trials with home made pizza and all 5 kids say this is the best!",,
325816,1005,2008-05-22,4,This dough worked out great and was put together in minutes. The whole wheat made it very filling and nutritious. I added some sugar to the dough as the kids prefer it that way. There wasn't a crumb left.,,
157167,1005,2008-05-23,5,"I already had a jar of sauce, but will try that next time.  The dough was wonderful, soft, fluffy, and easy to work with.  I'm glad I decided to try a new recipe!!",,
568205,1005,2008-06-07,4,"This was great! I made the crust and just used boughted sauce. The only problem I had was that the middle wasn't fluffy enough.

613495,1005,2008-07-05,5,"This is so delicious.  I especially love the very easy but scrumptious pizza sauce.  No more store bought sauce for me.  I didn't have red wine but I replace a few tablespoons of  the water with balsamic or red wine vinegar and it is incredible that way!  

The dough is very easy.  I mix it in my bread machine and it works very well.",,

656377,1005,2008-08-06,5,"A wonderful crust indeed! 
I have prepared the crust in a variety of ways and was a big hit each time. In a pecan wood fired oven with a bit of fresh rosemary added, at home I also pre-baked for about 8-10 minutes depending on the thickness. I have frozen the dough and taken it to a bbq and cooked it on the grill, was loved by all. I make two batches now and vacum seal and freeze the pizza so I don't have to order out and it perfect and on time every time. Thanks!

Very easy to spice up the sauce or dough, great as is, also good for hot pockets.",,

It was THAT good!). I did have to add some special touches to the sauce, extra garlic and onion and what not.

If you being iffy about making pizza, you should TRY IT!!!!! It's not hard at all. The only thing I didn't like, was kneading it...but hey, I have to get a work out some way, right? ;].",,
309513,1005,2008-10-02,5,"I loved this recipe! It wasn't too bready and using half wheat and half white gave the dough more flavor. I sprinkled granulated garlic in with the flour, and cut the sugar by half or so because I like more bite, but the pizza was perfect topped with proscuitto and pepperoni!",,
337671,1005,2008-10-06,5,"This was yummy!  I only let it rise once because I ran out of time giving myself an hour since that's what it says at the top of the recipe.  If you let it rise twice, it would take a little longer.  But even with one rising it was very good.  I sprinkled cornmeal on the pizza stone before rolling out the dough.  Thanks for the recipe!",,

I have made plenty of dough before and I had almost lost all hope because I, Just alwasys did something wrong but this was perfect and foolproof And it tasted amazing my husband said it was the best pizza he had ever had, I didn't used to sauce recipe as i bought a ready made one from the store which I really love, Also I cooked the pizza in a microwave oven and it turned out brilliant as we have a pizza function on ours so Its good to know the recipe works well in Microwave ovens and Normal ovens This has now become a regular meal on or weekly menus!",,
465080,1005,2009-01-16,5,"Used 1 1/2 c spelt and added white flour 1/2 c at a time.  The dough did not take the entire 2 1/2 c flour.  Used it for one thick crust pizza.  Though I made several kitchen errors, this pizza dough was still wonderful.  Thank you Marg!",,
755811,1005,2009-03-02,5,"I have actually never made pizza dough before, but I had just picked up a bunch of root vegetables from the farmers market, which I roasted, and I really wanted to use for pizza topping. The dough came together beautifully on my kitchenaid and turned out just crispy enough and not at all soggy. I used all white flour since when I went for my whole wheat the bag was like a brick (darn Oregon moisture!). I was originally not going to make the sauce and make my own instead, but I got lazy and decided to give it a try. I was amazed! I omitted the sugar because of what others had said and since I really don't like overly sweet pizza sauce, used white wine (probably close to double the recommended amount) and added some chopped fresh italian parsley and crushed red pepper flakes. I got a lot of yumms from this recipe and I will use it again and again.",,
368410,1005,2009-03-12,5,"We have made this crust a couple times now and we're addicted! We make the crust exactly as stated 1/2 and 1/2 flour, adding only a couple tablespoons of water when humidity is low. We have not made the sauce, since we prefer just tomato paste spread around with a sprinkle of Italian seasonings. We like to have adventurous toppings, so we keep our sauce simple. Today we added grilled chicken, feta, Parmesan, fresh basil and sun dried tomatoes to one, and pulled chipotle pork, mozzarella, extra sharp cheddar, green peppers and green onions to the other. The crust is perfect for our tastes and complimented our pizzas beautifully. Thank you.",,
649153,1005,2009-03-13,5,"This dough recipe is good and very easy, but the sauce is to die for!  It is the BEST pizza sauce I've ever had.  It's the only recipe I will use from now on.",,
729254,1005,2009-04-06,5,"Perfect! Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe(s)!! I also like to use half wheat flour, improves the flavor and nutrition so much! The sauce is wonderful as well, simple and delicious.",,
802269,1005,2009-04-10,5,"I have tried several pizza doughs and this is one of the best.  I used only one cup whole wheat flour and grated a little parmesean into the batch.  I liked the pizza so much that I made the dough again the next day, using a bit more flour to make it stiffer, and formed it into sandwich buns.  Makes a great muffaletta!",,
710414,1005,2009-04-11,5,"Our family LOVED this pizza dough and sauce!  I made the dough and sauce according to the recipe.  It was easy, and turned out perfect.  I made one recipe and it was enough for two square cookie sheet pizzas.  I made one cheese and one cheeseburger pizza.  The dough held up well with the weight of the ingredients.   I made sure to oil the pan and sprinkle it with cornmeal and didn't have a problem removing the pizza from the pan.  The crust was thin, crispy, not too yeasty and the sauce, OMG.. wonderful.  The only changes I might make would be to knead some italian seasoning into the dough and double the sauce recipe so there is more of it.  Even my DIL, who doesn't care much for pizza kept going back from more and came over for leftover today.  Thanks for a great homemade pizza.. we can now quit ordering expensive takeout!",,

This is definitely both -- pretty tasty, to boot.  :)  I added some fennel seeds and basil to the sauce.  It was a little too sweet for our liking, though.  So, if I'm ever in a pinch, I'll use this one again -- but with a tad less sugar!",,

I usually make a deep dish pizza. I just take two 9"" cake pans (disposable works best) and spray them liberally with olive oil cooking spray, and let the dough rise in the oil.  Then pat it out if you need to, top, and bake as this recipe directs.  It never fails! :D",,
837390,1005,2009-05-16,5,"This sauce recipe is wonderful! Everyone I've made it for loves it! I used Italian style tomato paste (which you can find at most grocery stores...it has a few spices already added) then I added 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, then followed the recipe exactly as shown here. The result ended up tasting very similar (but not identical) to Papa John's pizza sauce. However, I think this is just a bit better than Papa J's.",,
736815,1005,2009-05-23,4,"Loved the crust! Made it with 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat flour like suggested - it came out with a nice texture. I will definitely make this again.
The sauce was a little sweet, and next time I will omit the sugar. I prefer using sweet basil to sugar in my tomato sauces. Also, it made too much sauce for one pizza, but not quite enough for two. I would suggest increasing the sauce recipe by 1/2, then it would be enough for 2 pizzas.",,
793530,1005,2009-06-01,4,This dough was excellent.  I used all wheat flour and it tasted great and had a good texture.  Baked it on a pizza stone for 20 minutes.,,
1290129,1005,2009-06-08,5,My family loves this crust and it is so easy to make.  I am so glad I found this recipe that uses 1/2 wheat.  We love to make BBQ chicken pizza or Chicken Pesto Pizza with this dough.  Must try!!!,,
526810,1005,2009-06-15,4,We only made tha sauce and it was fantastic!  I would have given five or six stars fro sauce alone but since we didn't try the pizza dough I felt like I could not.  This will be my new staple from now on.  Thanks for the great recipe!,,
345702,1005,2009-07-29,5,"Delicious and easy! I would have given it more stars if I could have. I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was perfect (and thanks for the two freezing methods). I used half white and half wheat flour, rolled it out on my pizza stone and baked it for 20 minutes to perfection. The sauce was to die for! I chose to add wine instead of water using a mild cab sav. For the seasoning, I used 1/2 t of Pensey's pizza seasoning. Next time I'll add 1t. All in all, very yummy, very simple and much healthier than take-out. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",,
1306468,1005,2009-08-22,5,"The Best of the Best! The whole wheat gives the dough what it needs. I also sprinkled some cornmeal on the bottom, for texture. I <3 it. My family <3s it. Thank-You!",,

1376400,1005,2009-11-14,5,the review is for the sauce alone. It was pretty good although I made some changes. I used 2 tsp of brown sugar instead of 1 tbsp. Same goes with olive oil. I also added only a little more that 1/4 tsp salt. I tossed in a clove of garlic that I took out when the sauce was done. I sub dried parsley for oregano and that's fine. I like the rich wine flavor in the sauce but may try half wine half broth next time because it takes more time than I'm willing to spend to cook the alcohol down.,,
249381,1005,2009-12-25,5,yum! I have never had whole wheat crust and liked it this was awesome my family agreed I made one and a half recipes to eat two and freeze one but we ate all three! Thank you,,

530501,1005,2010-01-10,5,"Great pizza crust. I followed the advice of another reviewer about baking the crust before adding sauce and toppings. Great idea, but next time I will bake for 7 minutes, not 5 beforehand. I have had a problem with soggy crusts. It wasn't soggy this time, but not crisp like I wanted. This was actually the second dough I made, after the first didn't work out. I think my whole grain flour wasn't as fresh as it should have been. I wasn't able to press the dough larger. Anyways, with this recipe, I used all purpose flour and I was able to spread it well and it had a fresh, yeasty flavor. I loved  the ""foam"" action. Something new for me.",,

4/11/09 - We have finally found a pizza dough that will work and tastes amazing. It held up well with all the toppings we threw at it. The kids got pepperoni, but I made a veggie Mediterranean and it didn't fall apart - NOR was it too hard. This was so absolutely perfect!",,

I can't remember where I saw it, but I also let the dough rise in the oven with the light on, which works pretty well.  Not only easy and thorough, but tasty as well.  I think next time I'll brush the crust with some garlic butter.  The sauce was also wonderful, I would definitely recommend using the red wine.  I topped with roasted red & yellow peppers and turkey pepperoni (yum!)  Thanks for posting, and thanks again for the excellent directions.",,

It is obviously pretty difficult to mess up because I do NOT know how to knead dough or anything, but it came out great. I only had bread machine yeast so no activation was necessary and it rose just fine. My husband said the crust was ""wheatie"" and it was... I loved it and my two-year-old could not get enough.

If you like a thick hearty crust, this will be right up your ally.  For the sauce I used splenda for the sugar. Instead of using red wine OR water, I used a combination of both. I used up what I had left of the red wine and it wasn't quite enough so I added the water to get the needed amount.  This reminded both myself and DH of the type of pizza my in laws would like, but it's not our favorite.",,

307214,1005,2013-10-27,5,"Yummy. Followed recipe almost but added lots of toppings (salami, peppers, onions, and mushrooms).  Used 1/2 whole wheat.",,
2635439,1005,2014-02-03,5,"This is for the sauce only as I haven&#039;t tried the crust recipe.  This is the absolute best sauce I have ever had for pizza.  It is so good I have deleted all other sauce recipes and my family has even asked that we just keep this one.  I followed the directions exactly and even added the garlic powder like suggest great!  Haven&#039;t tried the crust yet because my family likes really thin crust, but this sauce is awesome!",,
1179225,1005,2014-04-23,5,"Mmmmmm...5 stars for both the sauce and the crust! I used 1 cup WW flour and 3 cups of white flour. My DH was able to get the crust real thin and it held up to the toppings without being limp or soggy. He cooked it on the grill and it only took about 10 mins. The sauce was very flavorful and thick. I used about a 1/4 t. of garlic powder and red wine and it made the sauce kind of tangy, which we really enjoyed. Thanks for the keeper recipe.",,
452355,1005,2017-09-26,3,"We made the crust part of this recipe (not the sauce). I thought it was good, but my hubby did not care for the half white/half wheat idea, which is what we made. I will try and review again using all white flour and also after making the sauce.",,
36934,1008,2002-04-10,0,I added pizza cheese to the top for the last five minutes of baking. Would be good to add either italian sausage or pepperoni to filling.,,

107635,1024,2004-05-25,5,"Yes! Yes! This is the recipe. This is how my Grandma made them. If you follow directions they turn out right. I hope Nancy won't be horrified but I just wanted some so bad I made it with stewed prunes. Not great. But I could tell that with real plums in season, the recipe is perfect. Okay, one caution here: If you don't like substantial, rustic peasant food, this is not for you.
Think of it as big brunch food rather than delicate dessert.",,
193252,1024,2005-02-11,4,"Yes, this is very similar to my mother's recipe. I don't remember the farina, though, and she used prune preserves or lecvar instead of plums.",,

268888,1031,2011-09-17,4,"Good recipe! Not a ""true"" chowder however. That's the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars. I used the water from cottage roll making and just boiled the beans seperately to avoid losing too much liquid.  I added: potatoes, sweet potatoes , and celery (I didn't have carrots or green pepper). I took before and after pictures for fairness because as a soup it's very good and people may like it that way, I did, but I went ahead and made a chowder version and pic'd that too(because well now that I've been thinking about chowder ALL day, I had to :) ). I mashed 1/3 of the beans to thicken it (before adding to soup) and added 2-3 cups of milk, still not as thick as I'd prefer. It's very good both ways, Yum. Thank you for posting Libby1, I have saved this recipe and WILL be making it both ways again and again!",,
53425,1033,2002-11-18,4,"MMM, good! Took this to a family dinner where it had to compete with 2 other desserts; hardly any was left. (And the remains were NOT passed back to me to take home, I noticed.) I did make a few changes to suit my taste: I used about 1 2/3 cups pumpkin (1/2 large can,) I think it would have been too dry a batter otherwise, and made a syrup with more citrus juice and less sugar.",,

I am putting this in tubs that are decorated for the holidays and will accompany cookies and spicy sweet nuts.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter and 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  I also used half multi grain chex and half corn chex.  Thanks for posting!!,,
9328,1035,2003-12-08,5,This stuff is awesome!  A friend of mine used to make it every year for Christmas and do the same thing as riffraff and put it in a tub.  We'd have it the whole holiday season at work and just munch on handfuls at a time.  Not the healthiest thing but it's good!!!,,
113535,1035,2003-12-26,5,An old family favorite... thanks for reviving it... I had to add a little more powdered sugar to coat evenly because I could only find a 12oz box of Crispix. But other than that left the recipe as is.,,

160453,1035,2008-08-15,5,"Was looking for a fun and easy recipe to do with my two boys and this was a definite winner!  So much fun and easy enough for little ones to help out Mom.

Perhaps we'll try this again...but we'll use a different cereal like Chex. Thanks for sharing. But I think I'll stick to baking cookies for my children instead of covering my kitchen & dog in powdered sugar. lol Many Blessings.",,
795619,1035,2009-01-02,5,"If I could, I would give this 10 stars!  This stuff is evil...once you start eating, you can't stop.  I use rice chex instead of crispix.  I also like to add peanuts to it.  Super yummy!",,
309982,1035,2009-02-03,5,"Made it for a party (to watch Puppy Bowl V on Animal Planet) and my guests loved it. Brought the left overs to work and it went fast as well. 
I used organic almond butter instead of peanut butter, and peanut butter chips. I think it would be DaBomb is mixed with pecans or other tree nuts as well. Have fun experimenting.
I used a generic rice chex. This is messy, messy, messy -- but worth the trouble, in my book.
My suggested use for the leftover powdered sugar? Sift out cereal bits, and add to your favorite drinking chocolate mix, with a dollop of cinnamon, for Mexican Hot Cocoa.",,

107498,1035,2009-09-26,5,"Just as I remember it from years ago!  The changes I made were to use one 10oz bag of Enjoy Life chocolate chips, GFCF butter substitute, 1/2 peanut butter and 1/2 sunflower seed butter, and a box of Rice Chex.  This made the recipe gluten and casein free.  I used regular store-bought confectioners' sugar but if you are avoiding corn, you will of course want to make your own powdered sugar.

AWESOME!  Thanks for posting!

(Beware:  This can get very messy!)",,
140806,1035,2009-11-12,5,"Umm...yum! I have always loved these treats and finally decided to look it up and make it for myself. I used Corn Chex and scaled back on the butter just a little. Excellent! As other reviewers have mentioned, THIS IS MESSY, but worth it!",,

I melt the stuff in the microwave in a big plastic bowl and then mix in the cereal and then dump the powdered sugar on top.  I then seal the lid really good and shake and roll the bowl around.  It works really well to mix in the powdered sugar.  This is awesome addicting stuff but a little messy.

Recipes with 1/2c peanut butter and 1 c chocolate chips call for 9-10 cups of cereal.  I didn&#039;t measure the cereal before making the recipe, assuming it would be doubled too, 18-20 cups, and I ended up with not enough puppy chow.  I thought the coating was very thick.

I also use Italian breadcrumbs in the meatloaf and substitute minced garlic for some of the onion. For the gravy,  I also decreased flour and upped the wine for a thinner, more flavorful gravy. It made great hot leftovers and was also yummy for cold sandwiches.",,
36739,1042,2015-12-13,5,"I made this yesterday, having purchased a beef/pork ground meat mixture, although I have not made meatloaf for years. Since it would just be my husband &amp; I, I decided to halve the recipe, which accommodated the approximately 1 pound package of ground meat. I also halved the breadcrumbs, but left the rest of the ingredients unchanged. As the mixture seemed a bit dry, I also added 1 more egg. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t think to reduce the cooking time, with the result that the meatloaf was a bit blackened around the edges (the dog enjoyed those bits with his dinner). The gravy was excellent (I messed up the directions, but was able to salvage it). I would recommend this recipe unreservedly, with just a word of warning about the cooking time. We really enjoyed it!",,

I wavered between four and five stars on this one, but have a new Zo bread machine and am giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt. Due to the size of my bread machine pan, I'd probably double the recipe next time. Also wondered if the yeast should be increased. Definitely worth a go, and I'd make it again.",,

I agree with the other post that I should have doubled the recipe because it produced a very small loaf. (I wasn't sure what to expect because it has been a long time since I used my machine.) I also increased the sage to 1/2 teaspoon and it gave it a nice flavor- I love sage. The cornmeal gave it a nice hearth-y texture and the crust was nice and crisp.

I think I would have REALLY loved if it were a bit fluffier, rather than as dense as it was- but overall the flavor and texture were really nice. Thanks for sharing!",,

The topping did not bubble into the mixture and cook as I thought it would.  When I pulled it out of the oven, I had a lot of raw flour coating the top.  The topping was very gooey underneath that.  It was not difficult to prepare, especially with a food processor.  The longest step was mincing the meat (I used eye of round).

Anyway, mashed potatoes with meat & gravy. I wanted to fix something different. I remembered the TV dinner. So to Zaar, I did turn & found this recipe. I didn't have time to use a crock pot or use dried beans. I used 2 cans of pinto beans. I rinsed them. I did not add 2 chopped onions. I sprinkled in some dried onions flakes. (I did not measure how much I added. I don't like a lot of onion.) I did not add mustard because I was out of it. I used Bulleye's Smokin' Chiptole BBQ sauce. I read the reviews, so I sprinkled in crushed red pepper. Once again, I did not measure because I like it hot. I cooked it on the stovetop. It turned out wonderful.

I reduced the baking powder to 1tsp. and also added in 3/4 tsp. of baking soda.  I  added 1/3 c. of chocolate protein powder to give it a health boost. They were wonderful!

199657,1151,2006-03-12,5,"Haven't made the bars as directed, but I use the crumb mixture as a topper for my crisps--apple, quince, blackberry, peach... It is AWESOME!  I add cinnamon and/or ginger to the mix depending on the fruit I use:  I mix the fruit with a little flour, sugar, and spices, then bake it for 20-30 minutes (depending on the fruit--quince takes longer), then add the topping and return it to the oven for another 20-30 mins.
Thanks a bunch!",,
345915,1151,2006-10-18,0,"I'm sure these would turn out wonderful if you followed the recipe more exactly than I did.  I didn't have strawberry preserves, just frozen strawberries.  So I took the strawberries, thawed them and put them in the blender with some honey and used that for the strawberry preserves (there was 2 cups).  So the bars are more moist than they should be and there is not the intense strawberry taste.  But what I do have is yummy gushy strawberry bars.  Learn from me, don't do that, use the preserves.",,
59686,1151,2007-01-09,5,"Recipezaar, I shared these bars with my daughter ( a.k.a. Beet ) and her husband.  
She said these were really good.  This recipe called for 1 cup of the strawberry preserves, 
I thought that wasn't enough, 
so I used ( 16 ounces ) from an 
( 18 oz. )jar.  
I also reserved 1-1/2 cups of the crumb mixture for the topping; instead of the 1/2 cup it called for.  
I baked the bars for 35 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  
After removing the bars from the oven.  
I immediately ran a sharp knife around the inside of the pan, 
so the preserves wouldn't stick to the pan.  
When the bars cooled down, 
I drizzled with the melted chocolate, ran the knife again around the inside of the pan, 
and cut the bars into squares 
( before placing them in the refrigerator for 1 hour ).  
This can make up to 24 bars instead of 20.",,

EDIT: The first time I made these I also read the instructions incorrectly and reserved half the mixture instead of half a cup.  This time I just reserved the half cup and I think I actually like it better using a little more than half the mixture for the bottom, and then the rest for the top. It's more like a nutra-grain bar that way, and they're one of my weaknesses^_^",,

It's no more work to make an entire recipe than a scaled down version and you get the bonus of picante sauce in the freezer anytime you need it.  I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and cut the sugar in half.  I will reduce that to 2T next time.  No need for the alum.  This is going to work wonderfully in sooo many recipes.,,

I do reduce the sugar by half and add 2 tsp of red pepper flakes since we like our picante on the hot side, but it is excellent just the way it is. I don&#039;t freeze it. I process it in canning jars, just like instructed and make enough batches to last all year long.

They flattened right out, and stuck to the pan after 6 1/2 minutes. But while I was scraping them off the pan, I ate a few, and they were very tasty. I added a bit more flour before baking the second batch and that helped them keep their shape a bit better. Also baked them for 6 minutes only.

156653,1236,2006-01-20,5,"Very good and Very simple. I did make a change though. I fried up a couple of slices of bacon and just put them in whole instead of crumbling. I am sure I didn't change the flavor too much, and these were very good! Thanks",,
230912,1236,2006-09-02,5,This was really really yummy!!!,,
373887,1236,2006-11-08,4,I made this last night.  Very easy and delicious recipe.  I made it in an iron skillet.  I suggest this not be done.  This is the second chicken recipe that I have made in an iron skillet and the sauce tasted burnt.,,
43327,1236,2006-12-22,5,"Woweeee!!! I used Penzys shallot pepper for the salt & pepper, but otherwise followed your directions.  What a great quick recipe for those nights you dont have much time to cook, but dont want anything boring.   Its also great for all the days in between. Thank you!",,
51011,1236,2007-01-10,5,"I made this tonight for dinner.  Halved it for the two of us.  I did make one change- instead of putting the bacon inside the chicken, I wrapped it around the outside.  I really enjoyed it, as did dh.  Thanks for sharing!",,
1471704,1236,2009-12-05,5,"Made these last night, my partner and I loved them. I baked them in the oven rather than doing them on the stove top, and used chicken bacon rather than the usual kind. So yummy, highly recommended!",,
1161157,1236,2009-12-13,5,This was a great quick dinner. I added some Italian Seasoning and it tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!,,
437973,1236,2007-02-27,5,"Absolutely wonderful!  I made this dish two nights in a row because my husband loved it so much (and didn't leave leftovers).  On the first night, I made the chicken according to the recipe, except, I stuffed the chicken with the whole slices of bacon, instead of crumbled bacon.  For the sauce, I used the bacon grease instead of the oil and substituted flour for the cornstarch.  It had a good taste, but was too thick.  On the second night, I followed one of the other comments and wrapped the chicken with bacon, in addition to placing bacon inside the chicken.  OK, so my husband was in hog heaven (no pun intended).  As for the sauce, I doubled the amounts for the sauce and it came out much better (go figure).  Wonderful recipe...highly recommended!!",,
524997,1236,2007-08-22,4,Really easy.  Very good too!!!!,,
203823,1236,2007-09-26,5,"This was excellent and very easy.  I used Monterrey Jack instead of cheddar because we like white cheeses. Also, I pounded out the breasts and folded them to make a pocket instead of cutting them.  Very quick and delicious!",,
404046,1236,2007-10-10,5,"Just made this tonight.  It came out so good!  Followed other suggestions by pounding out chicken and putting cheese and slices of bacon in the middle, then folding it and wrapping it with bacon.  Also, added a splash of white wine to the sauce.  Came out amazing!  Thanks!",,
411567,1236,2007-12-11,5,"Wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly, except, I only had shredded cheese.  I really had to shove it into the chicken and secure it really well, so it didn't fall out. This was very yummy. Everyone really loved it. Kids had seconds.",,
542953,1236,2007-12-27,5,"Oh! I.ve triesd it for 2 times and it's so good. First, I just tried a couple of breast to see what it gonna be. Then I let my kids and husband taste it, they all love it. Then my kids ask me to cook again for they really love it. Then I cooked again on our family special dinner. And they still want me to cook some more. Thanks for that recipe.",,
365507,1236,2008-01-22,5,Loved this. Melted a little shredded cheese on top w/a little more bacon.,,
654929,1236,2008-01-28,5,"OMG!!  I made this with corn on the cob and twice baked  potatoes.  This was easy to make, and VERY, VERY tasty.  I will definately make this again.  I would not be ashamed to fix this for a big family get together, or friends over....yummy.",,
532390,1236,2008-02-01,5,ONE of my favorite dished!!! I took another readers recommendation and wrap the bacon around the chicken as shown in the photo. It's so good I cook it for guests at dinner parties all the time!,,
192344,1236,2008-04-02,4,"This was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  The chicken wasn't spiced up enough for us.  I'll definetely make it again but next time, I'll add more spices or maybe coat it in some cornflake crumbs.",,
461867,1236,2008-06-18,5,I made this dish and it was delightful!  I did use more cheese.  I used a full slice of american cheese inside of each breast and it turned out great!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  This is a keeper.,,
784743,1236,2008-08-26,5,Soooo Good! I used mozzrella instead of cheddar and it still turned out wonderful. I will be making this quite often now. =),,
355637,1236,2008-10-13,4,This is so good. I would use a little more cheese next time- can never have enough!,,
969481,1236,2008-12-20,4,These were very good. I used provolone instead of cheddar as a personal prefference and they turned out great! Thanks for posting!,,
483932,1236,2009-01-04,5,I just made this for dinner and it was great. I used what I had on hand which was Boursin cheese (garlic and herb). I pounded out my chicken breasts spread a good amount of cheese on them and rolled them up. I then wrapped bacon around each roll. Salt and pepper and the rest is the recipe. I did triple the sauce as I was serving this with mashed potatoes. It was a hit with everyone.  Thanks!,,
1090109,1236,2009-01-19,5,Hi - this recipe was wonderful.  My fiance and I enjoyed the meal and I have forwarded this on to friends.  The only change I made was pounding out the chicken and rolling it up with toothpicks rather than cutting a pocket and stuffing.  Worked great. Thanks for posting!,,
950577,1236,2009-05-12,5,This was delicious even my picky son loved it,,
1189488,1236,2009-08-06,5,I made this last night and I was fantastic!! The chicken had great flavor and it was super moist! I pounded the chicken and rolled it with the cheese and bacon inside! Very flavorful!!,,

716215,1236,2009-12-02,2,"I didnt care for this, although I think it was mainly because of the sharp cheddar cheese. We think if we made it with diff. cheese it wuold be better.",,
1449637,1236,2010-01-08,5,"""We really love it,"" says 6 yr. old Joel.  We wrapped the chicken breasts with the bacon, as some advised, and baked it in the oven not making the gravy, since our family isn't into gravy.  The paprika added nice color but not much flavor -- I'll probably add more next time.  And we dumped a LOT of shredded cheddar on top, as well as loading the insides of the chicken with more than the recommended amount of sharp cheddar.  Very tasty.",,
1871673,1236,2011-09-23,5,"Love, Love, Love this recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter, since to me that is the only way to fairly rate a recipe. Its perfect as is.. Thank you for posting",,

134624,1246,2006-02-21,4,"This was my first attempt at making gnocchi. I was actually surprised at how easy it was, although rolling and cutting all those little pieces did take a bit of time. After reading other recipes for gnocchi, I realize I should have shaped the pieces, mine were a bit thick, and as a result there were a few peices that still tasted ""doughy"". My husband said he liked it, and took the leftovers for lunch today, so it couldn't have been too bad.  :)Thanks!",,

I will admit, I bought fresh gnocchi from the market so I didn't use that portion of the recipe but the sauce is amazing!  I now use this on pasta for my lunches quite regularly.  So fresh tasting and simple.  I must admit, though, the combo with the gnocchi (my favorite) is still the best. DH says I can make this ANYTIME!  Thanks so much, Cheryl, for sharing!",,
299463,1249,2006-03-06,5,"I deleted the butter and used olive oil and boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  This is absolutely fabulous and very easy to make!",,

Oh yes, I used thighs instead of chicken breasts. I also simply simmered on stovetop for an hours because other reviewers tried it and apparently like it that way. Thank you for a nice change to regular fried chicken, this would be something I would want once in a while.",,

583643,1249,2007-10-30,5,"It did take a while to chop the rind, and, since my oranges were huge and homegrown (i.e. with tons more flavor than store-bought), I only used 1. I also used boneless skinless leg meat and omitted the oil. My husband, normally stoic about my kitchen experiments, actually spoke up and said he liked this dish! I used some of the sauce to flavor Costco stir-fry veg mix, and the dinner disappeared before the rice was half-ready :)) I can imagine this will be a great make-ahead dish for my Shabbat dinners. Thanks, Ms. Randal!",,

176471,1267,2005-01-06,5,"This was fantastic. Everyone loved it and, unfortunately, there were no leftovers:) I tripled the amount of sauce and used olive oil (couldn't find peanut where I live) and used fresh broccoli. Loved the flavour. Thanks for sharing this one.",,

112411,1267,2005-09-20,5,"This tasted so much like the Beef&Broccoli at Panda Express! I doubled the sauce and added some oyster sauce to it, but I think it would have been fine w/o it. I did not add any additional salt, it is already salty enough.",,

56087,1267,2007-02-20,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  I added additional steak, mushrooms and green beans along with the fresh broccoli.  I SHOULD have added additional garlic and ginger.  Was still REALLY good as is and I will be making this again.",,

26075,1267,2009-05-25,5,"This really was good.  It came together quickly.  I used a nice tender top sirloin instead of flank steak, because that is what I had on hand.  This was nice and flavorful.  I will make this from now on when I do my chinese buffet for a crowd.",,

1088637,1267,2010-09-24,5,"This was awesome (and I'm just about to make it again, today!)  I followed the directions as stated, except that I cooked the marinated beef on its own in the oil, garlic and ginger . .. and steamed the broccoli separately.

Did another double batch of sauce, threw it in and it was still not enough.  Next time will just do 6 times the amount of sauce, which I think would be perfect, especially if your serving over rice.  Great flavor though!!",,

92699,1293,2003-07-03,4,"These tasted just like the ones my grandmother used to make!  They were also really easy & quick.  The one drawback was that they didn't quite hold together as well as I'd hoped.  (They cooled about 24 hours before serving, but the chocolate never quite hardened again.)  As Sherry F. mentioned, I might try changing the order of the chips/nuts next time I make 'em, and I definitely will be making them again! :)",,

So, I took the baggie off the hood and got in my car.  Needless to say, when I was driving I devoured all of the bars. They were phenominal! I knew they had to be from my neighbor, so when I got home, I ran like a wild woman to her house.  ""What were those bars that you left me?"" I begged.  She said, ""Seven Layer Magic Bars!  If you want the recipe, I can get it from my friend.""  I thanked her, but refused, because I knew that one quick trip to Recipezaar and I would have the recipe.  And I was right!  They are so good that I'm afraid to make any more, because I'm trying desperately to loose weight, and with these in the house, my will power will be gone!

139541,1293,2008-01-05,5,This is a great recipe that my family has made for as long as I can remember. The only difference that I do is that I press the crumbs into the melted butter to form a crust and I save the condensed milk as the last layer that is drizzled in an even coating to bind the other ingredients as well. This is very addicting! Next time I am going to try this recipe with chocolate condensed milk.,,
591748,1293,2008-02-27,5,I dont know where you got this recipe but I hane had it for 2 years. It  matches mine to a -tee its sooo yummy I make it more than often. I got mine out of the Joy of baking cooking cookbook the Christmas of 06. If you havent had it yet you should try it. Its great,,
416292,1293,2008-07-07,5,"Whenever I am invited to someone's house, this is what I am told to bring. So yummy! I also sprinkle white chocolate chips and leave off the nuts since people can be so finicky :) I also pour on the sweetened condensed milk right before I pop it in the oven. I would watch the cook time because the edges tend to cook real fast and then it's a real hassle to cut because they stick to the side of the pan. Maybe greasing pan first would help? I will try that next time.",,

674749,1293,2016-12-24,5,"These were amazing and simple. You can make some small tweaks to suit your own taste, too. We've made it subbing caramel for butterscotch, and we've used slivered almonds for the nuts, too. You can mix and match how you want. Just make sure you get the Condensed milk spread evenly. My first time making it, I didn't do this so I had some spots harder then others and some soft, When I made sure it was even... no problem. Also, pressing it all down firmly is IMPORTANT. If you don't press it down, the top layers won't be &quot;stuck&quot; to the bars. I almost forgot this step, but remembered as I was putting in the oven..

68715,1296,2004-05-14,4,"I didn't have fresh parsley or thyme. I used half the amount or dried herbs-it was fine. Excellent flavour, but I thought it needed a sprinkle of salt. So unbelieveably easy to make-and so fast! Looked really good, too. I used flounder for this. ",,
87023,1296,2005-01-08,4,"This was really good and so easy to do, used fresh lemon thyme and parsley also took Mae East's advice and added salt.  I used Leatherjacket fillets for this.  As these fillets are fairly thin and my micro is 1200W power only took 2 mins to cook.",,
8005,1303,2001-04-09,4,"This was a terrific cheesecake!  I substituted coconut extract for the almond extract,

152118,1303,2009-04-13,5,This is so good!  I did make a couple of changes inlcuding a pecan sandy cookie crust with about 1/4 cup toasted coconut and 1/4c. butter mixed with the cookie crumbs.  I also substituted 1 tsp coconut extract for the almond. The rest I followed.  I like the dense consistency of this type of cheesecake. I took it to Easter dinner and it was a big hit.,,

I used a bag of frozen onions & peppers and just used taco seasoning instead of salt, cumin, oregano, and pepper.  Lime juice was just the perfect thing!  Excellent.",,
1457196,1306,2010-09-11,5,Wonderful flavor and meat was tender.  I added more cumin as my family loves that spice.  This is a keeper!,,
472275,1306,2011-05-23,4,"Like others I didn't have time to marinate over night.  I also didn't have fresh bell peppers, so I had to omit them. I added 1/4 tsp red pepper in place of the bell peppers. I dumped all other ingredients as listed into the skillet and cooked on high for 10 or 15 minutes, then drained as much of the fluid as I could. I put a little oil back in so it wouldn't stick and cooked over medium a few more minutes.  I thought this turned out pretty good, but my husband thought it was too spicy.  I gave it a 4 as a compromise. :)Thanks for sharing!",,
1058174,1306,2011-07-03,3,"This was just okay. I added 1 seeded, diced jalapeno pepper and still the flavor wasn't really there. I did marinate overnight as stated in the recipe. I cooked this on the grill in a grill basket. It just seemed to be lacking something.",,
198154,1306,2013-06-27,5,"Marinated everything except the chicken for 24 hours.  We have vegetarians in our house so we left out the chicken and added a bag of frozen Quorn tenders to the pan instead.  We loaded our table with warm low carb and flour tortillas, shredded lettuce, cheeses, sour cream, salsa and tomatoes.  Everyone made there own and loved them!!  This recipe is a keeper!",,

193103,1317,2005-10-17,4,"This is a very good mild (not too sweet) muffin recipe. I only used 1 tbsp of cinnamon, and I used about a half cup more apple.  I just ate one warm out of the oven with some butter melted on it and it was very tastey!  Definitely a recipe I'd use again.",,

68884,1317,2006-01-14,4,"Super easy, full of flavor. It's the perfect amount of cinnamon flavor. I combined the dry ingredients, then added the wet ones & apples. They baked perfectly in 16 minutes. I think I would increase the chopped apple to a full cup, though. 3/4 cup is about half a small apple; I used Gala. Thanks - I will make these again .",,
125773,1317,2006-01-26,5,wonderful muffin! I love the cinnamon with bits of apple. This recipe is very easy to prepare. I used heart healthy Bisquick and Splenda. Thank you for sharing.,,
358635,1317,2006-10-02,3,"this was an okay muffin recipe, it was missing something but couldn't figure out what, just wasn't the greatest.  Maybe I was looking for something sweeter, who knows?  I would probably add more apples if I tried it again.  ",,
605613,1317,2007-10-08,2,"This was very quick and easy, as promised, but I agree with other reviewers who said it tasted like it lacked something.  Overall, I just thought it was kind of bland.  It might have been better with a brown sugar crumb topping.   Also, I used twice the recommended amount of apples (1.5 cups) and I didn't feel the muffins were overwhelmed by apple flavor.",,
140943,1317,2008-03-15,4,"Considering some of the other reviews, I added a little bit (1/4 c) of apple ssauce to the batter.  Either it was too much or the apple sauce sabotaged the muffins.  They were very moist, but gooey in the middle,  a similiar texture to bread not baked all the way through.  I also couldnt find my muffin tin, so I baked in a cake pan.  That could be it too.  Flavor wasnt bad, I chopped up a whole small Gala apple.  I wanted a prominent apple taste to them.  Well, I did get that! LOL  Oh, and I added some brown sugar sprinkled on top before baking as suggested.  That was pretty good, too. Overall, probably wouldnt have been too bad had I not screwed around around with the recipe, so this recipe gets more stars than my version of it should have.  *L*",,
535633,1317,2009-04-18,5,I love these muffins.  They are moist.  The little bits of apples in them are so good.  I added some cinnamon chips to the batter for a little more flavor.  I will be making these again.  Thanks.,,
844554,1317,2010-04-22,5,These were so good and so easy to put together. I followed the recipe exactly and you can really taste the cinnamon. I also used the cupcake liners instead of spraying the cups. Made for I Recommend Tag Game 2010.,,
597071,1317,2012-03-14,5,"I thought these tasted really good. My husband who is never really excited about muffins loved them and asked me to make them again. He's NEVER done that. That's why I gave it 5 stars. I did however, add a brown sugar and oatmeal topping to them.",,
12250,1320,2001-07-10,5,I did not have soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce and this was wonderful!  I used it on a steak I later grilled and then on chicken breasts I panfried.  Both tasted great!,,
100185,1320,2004-07-31,4,"I used this on skinless boneless chicken breasts and it was fabulous.  I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder because everything needs more garlic.  I reduced the marinade while the chicken was cooking and used it as a dipping sauce.  I think next time I will use less honey, as the apple juice is pretty sweet.  I will definitely use this recipe again.",,
338906,1320,2006-08-01,4,"I used 1/2 tsp fresh grated ginger in place of ground, and 3 cloves of garlic minced in place of powder, and this was fantastic.  I can't see why people would used ground/powdered spices here when the fresh tastes so much better.",,
446143,1320,2008-05-03,3,"Gosh, this was just kindof bland for us.  I used fresh spices as well, marinated for 24 hours on boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I guess I just expected more flavor.  It was not bad by any means, but not very flavorful.",,
506344,1320,2009-02-14,5,I loved this combination! It was delicious!,,
1010338,1320,2009-07-24,4,"Made for Summer '09 Comfort Cafe.  I must admit that once I put this all together I had my doubts.  Certainly didn't smell very inviting.  I even poked my index finger in for a little dip and wasn't too excited about the outcome. BUT, BUT, once I marinated my chicken fingers for 24 hours, placed them on a skewer, then the bar-b...well it presented a wonderful surprise.  Light tasting, not heavy like some marinades, the sugar from the apple juice and honey, caramelized the tenders just enough.  Mmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm.  Will definitely make this again.  Perhaps I'll use pork chops next time.  Thanks for a wonderful marinade.",,
632585,1320,2009-11-05,4,"We loved this marinade. Using the proportions listed, this marinade almost completely covered three med-sized pork chops, which I left in the fridge for 2 days. The only exception was that I used fresh garlic, which I had quartered and chrushed open. We enjoyed the subtle flavor of the ingredients very much.",,
457943,1320,2013-04-14,5,"Love it! Used it twice now on boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs. I marinade all day and throw them on the grill. Great chicken by itself but I cook it in bulk and chop it up and freeze it to use for quick meals. Sweet and just a little tangy, keeps the chicken moist.",,
1369561,1322,2009-08-30,5,"I'm giving this recipe five stars because it was easily made vegan.  While it didn't have a lot of flavor (I'll make a note to use more vanilla next time), the batter was a wonderful consistency and it baked and rose nicely.  I made cupcakes and they turned out moist and fluffy.  The icing I made was sweet and flavorful, so that made up for the miminal flavor in the cupcakes themselves.",,

292448,1322,2013-08-22,5,"I&#039;ve made this twice and got very good results each time for an easy, moist and delicately flavored cake.  I don&#039;t like using shortening so 1/2 cup canola oil was substituted.  The first time I made the recipe, I didn&#039;t have enough milk so I used powdered buttermilk with 1 cup water and adjusted the leavening just in case to 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp baking soda.  We actually liked that version even better.  Both times I baked them in a greased 8 X 8 pan for 40-45 minutes.",,

176615,1355,2008-02-26,5,"Loved these! Wonderful hearty vegetarian main dish with lots of flavor. With the baking time listed, peppers will still be crunchy. Also, pearl barley must be precooked, and takes about 50-60 minutes, so plan accordingly. I use Bob's Red Mill pearl barley, and used the rice cooker to prepare. 1 c barley plus 3 c water gave me more than enough. Thanks for sharing, I'll make these again!",,
1185662,1355,2010-01-20,5,"I love this recipe! I am a big fan of traditional stuffed peppers with the meat and rice, but I have to admit, I like these even better. I had to use quick-cooking barley because it's what I had on hand, so I didn't pre-cook it. I also used sharp white cheddar cheese and used a can of plain tomato sauce. This works really well in a slow-cooker, too. I added a cup of water to the bottom and cooked it on high for 3 hours or so. This is what I call a perfect recipe!",,
498271,1355,2012-09-11,5,"Wow these were really good peppers!  I cooked my peppers in the microwave with a little water for about 4 minutes before stuffing them, otherwise made just as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  The marinara sauce was great with these and they were quite filling - didn't miss the meat at all.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",,
539686,1355,2013-01-16,5,"This is a great recipe. My husband commented how similar the texture of the barley is to ground meat, so you don't really feel like you are missing anything.

I needed to use a bit more water than shown on the recipe, to cook the rice, but just kept adding more until it was tender. For a bit of spice, I added some chopped chillies as well as some fresh rosemary from our garden.",,

I always have precooked ground beef/onions, and precooked brown rice in the freezer, so that shortened the prep time.  Instead of the tomatoes, I used leftover sauce from last night's Tex Mex Pork Chops by Millie.  It's salsa and chopped chilies, so the peppers had a kick.  Since I was only cooking two, I cooked them in my toaster oven with perfect results.  Definitely a keeper!",,

I used 2 14oz cans of Zesty Chili Recipe tomatoes, 1 1/2 cans in the recipe and half the can on top of the peppers just for looks.  I love the taste of the filling, the cheese already in it, and the fact that it's not as greasy as when you cook the meat in the peppers.  These were just wonderful!  My husband's only complaint was not enough rice, so next time I will double the rice.  Thanks for a great recipe!  It's replacing my old one, that's for sure!!",,

I wanted to try the recipe and made it expecting that my husband (who had a stuffed pepper about 30 years ago and didn't like it) and my son, (who doesn't care for ground beef outside of burgers) would just tolerate it. They rated it good and very good and I loved it. I used fat reduced cheddar, some Italian seasoning and chopped up half of a zucchini that would have headed for the compost bin in a few days. Cut large green peppers in half as per another reviewer's suggestion. Enjoyed leftover half today for lunch.",,

345039,1356,2008-08-13,5,"It's August as I write this, when produce is abundant from the garden and farmers' market, and I chose this recipe as my template for stuffed peppers, which I've not liked in the past. This 5-star recipe stood out by adding the leftover meat mixture to the baking pan.   

I used homegrown tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil, and cooked the rice separately, as I didn't trust the 1:1 ratio for rice:water. I added local cheddar at the end of baking, just because that's a familiar procedure. Now I'm about to taste the resultsâ€¦

It's wonderful, a real meal, and you don't feel like you're forced to eat a whole bell pepper; it's the shell for all this other good stuff. The pepper tastes deeper and more flavorful than almost any other way you can use it. This is excellent simple food, a gift of love to family and friends.",,
232480,1356,2008-08-28,5,"This was sooo good.  I must admit, I made a few changes based on ingredients I needed to use up.  I only had 3 bell peppers, but they were HUGE, so I still ended up using almost all the meat mixture inside the peppers.  I added 2 really big cloves of garlic.  I had garden tomatoes to use, so I peeled and diced those instead of using a can of tomatoes.  I cooked the rice separately since I knew I wasn't going to have the liquid from the can of tomatoes.  I doubled the Worcestershire, and I did not use the cheese due to my husband's allergies.  This turned out so well!",,
63024,1356,2008-09-07,5,"Great healthy recipe, with the trade of white rice, for brown  rice.  A few shots of Tabasco added a little heat.  I especially liked the canned tomatoes, due to the fact that I am trying to eliminate HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, which is in so many products.",,
634307,1356,2008-09-09,5,"Excellent recipe - very simple to make and delicious.  I substituted Gorgonzola cheese for half the cheddar to give it a little extra kick, but it's good either way.  Thanks for sharing!",,

854982,1356,2008-09-20,4,"Wow.  Hubby and I agree that these are the best stuffed peppers we've ever had.

I only made a few revisions due to not having some of the ingredients in my pantry--two 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes and minute rice instead of long grain rice (adjusting the cooking time accordingly).  I added a few things--two minced garlic cloves, one chopped jalepeno pepper and extra cheese for topping each pepper before baking.  It was a delicious, tummy-warming comfort-food style meal.  Thank you!",,

I was looking for a stuffed pepper recipe similar to the one someone near and dear to my heart used to make.  This one is very close!  I frequently make these peppers  to take to work for lunch.  They are just a good re-heated.  The only adjustment I make is I season the meat with season salt and black pepper in step 4 and then in step 5 I increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.  This is truely a comfort food!,,

I'll use this recipe from now on with the addition of tomato soup and more cheese!",,
4470,1356,2009-04-17,5,"Very tasty recipe.  I did add 1 tsp of hot sauce (I do like spice).
 I cut the peppers long ways - they cook faster and I  did not pre cook them.  25 minutes in 375 oven and they were perfect - still had some crunch to the peppers and totally hot through. Used Lite Havarti cheese.  Thanks for a very enjoyable recipe",,

I also added a little ketchup into the meat mixture. This was soley something I like, and does not have to be done to make these taste good. I also added a little ceyanne pepper. (sp) We like spicey around here!! All in all a very good recipe. ALSO, the rice did not get tender enough with the 1 cup rice per 1 cup water, even with the juices from the canned tomatos, so if you are using long grain rice, add 1 cup rice per 2 cups water regardless of the juices from the tomatos, I am re-cooking the whole mixture because there was not enough water to make the rice tender enough to go into the oven.",,
1244302,1356,2009-04-24,5,"Very, very good.  Preparation instructions were spot on and I like that the peppers are whole instead of halved.  The filling is fantastically flavorful and juicy as is.  I have also tried adding some shallots and spicier peppers to the filling as well as using sausage instead of ground meat but the bell peppers are mild enough and there is enough filling that it still didn't have much kick.  If you like spice I'd agree with the other reviewer who suggested putting hot sauce in with the meat.",,

Try omitting the shredded cheese and serving these with crumbled bleu cheese on top instead.  Divine!",,

574377,1356,2009-06-10,4,"Cindy was right, these need a little more flavor.  For a Southwestern touch, you can add a McCormick Chili mix (Hot or Mild) to the meat during mixing.  But just to make them taste better, use Tony Chashere's Cajun Seasoning to the mixture before stuffing.  Careful, use it instead of salt, and a little goes a long way, but it really is great.  Or you can use Emeril's Cajun seasoning.",,
1178797,1356,2009-06-11,5,"Made this dish last night for me and my husband. Neither of us had stuffed peppers before, so this was a treat! Made a few changes: used ground turkey instead of beef, did not pre-cook the peppers (we like a bit of crunch left!), and added rosemary, garlic powder, and Chipotle Tabasco. I followed the recommendation to add more water, but I added a bit too much. I was able to remedy that by using a slotted spoon to drain the meat mix while filling up the peppers. It's great topped with cheese, sour cream, and some diced green chilies on the side. Will definitely make again!! Can't wait to try it on the grill instead of the oven for the summer.",,

I also added a medium sized diced zucchini and a half a bag of frozen corn.  I could hardly keep my husband and my brother out of the mixture so i could stuff the peppers!  I beef mixture is great even by itself.  I had some left over and no more peppers, so I boiled some shells and stuffed them and popped them in the freezer for a quick meal later!  Delish!

1260491,1356,2009-07-25,5,"This was a good starting point recipe.  Do to my unpreparedness, I had to make some changes and created a new version of this classic.  One big change was I used ground turkey.  Those come in 19-20 oz. packages, which was good since I had eight peppers (some red and yellow too).  I took the tips from Cindy and added about four shakes of hot sauce into the meat mixture.  But I went a bit further (since my family likes it kicked up a notch). I added two tablespoons of chopped green chilies (canned) too.  I also like the idea of mushrooms I saw in another recipe.  So I chopped up about a 3/4th cup and added it to the meat mixture as well.  I had instant brown rice (not the long grain) so the simmer time was reduces to only 10-12 min.  Other than that the only other addition I made was topping it with more cheese.  Since I had more meat and eight peppers, I did increase the other ingredients a bit - but the measurments were not too specific.  The results were amazing - my friend and family are clammoring for more.  I'll add this one to my favorites.  Enjoy!",,

604324,1356,2009-08-21,5,Yum!!! I cut out the cheese and had to add a little water so the rice would cook. I also added tomato soup w/ a half can of water over the top of the peppers. Delish!,,

It could have used a little more kick but still yummy. I also made 1/2 the recipe without the meat and just hot sauce...Also, yummy.

966321,1356,2009-09-17,5,"I made this last night and it was delicious! I had to double the recipe because we had a lot of peppers ready from the garden. I used ground turkey instead of beef, used tomatoes from the garden instead of canned tomatoes (just used a bit more water than the recipe called for to substitute for the missing juice), more worchestershire sauce, and more cheese, which I mixed between cheddar and mozzarella. The main reason I made these changes was so that I wouldn't have to go to the store for one or two items, and the doubling of the batch was a last minute thing. I also added extra seasoning when the mixture was simmering with the rice (an herb mixture that I use on chicken a lot). I loved them, and boyfriend said they were amazing. We only baked four of the ones we stuffed and froze the remaining ones for later use. The blanching of the peppers really cut down on the baking time, and they peppers were so tender, but not mushy. I will def make these again.",,

I actually had to use a winter squash to stuff everything into because I cut into the peppers and all but one were bad :( But the winter squash actually turned out to be wonderful and my husband just raved! I doubled the worcestershire sauce (personal pref) and sprinkled seasoned salt on the squash and subbed seasoned salt for regular in the meat mixture. The squash was really big, so I just sliced it in half lengthwise and put it face-down on a cookie sheet, poured a little water around the squash and baked it for 25 minutes at 400 degrees.

1307411,1356,2009-10-17,5,"5 Stars for the sheer versatility.  You could really make this with any seasoning you like to give it an Italian/Cajun/Mexican/Asian/Etc. inspired taste.
I normally donâ€™t adjust recipes off the bat, I usually make them first and then the second time, adjust.  But in reading other reviews, and looking at the ingredients, I could surmise that the flavor would be lacking as there is no additional seasoning.  
My variation came out fantastic  - Husband said he had always stayed away from stuffed bell peppers as they were bland, gross and too much pepper.  Well, he loved these, ate the inside, the peppers and even went back for a second pepper!  A staple that will be added to my roster of pretty easy weekday dinners.
6 Medium Peppers (2 Orange, 2 Yellow 2 Red)  - save tops to equal about 1 cup diced
1.5 Ground Beef
1 Whole chopped Yellow Onion
1	14.5 oz can Diced Tomatoes
Â¾ Cup Basmati rice
Â¾ Cup Water
1 tsp Mediterranean Sea salt â€“ course grind to taste
1 Tablespoon Lea and Perrins Worsteshire Sauce
1Â½ Cup Shredded Kraft Sharp Cheddar (Fine Shred)
Heaping Tablespoons Minced Garlic
1 Tbsp San Francisco Seasoning (Spice Islands) â€“ About 1 tablespoon total
1 Tbsp Louisiana Style Cajun Seasoning (Spice Islands) â€“ About 1 tablespoon total
1 Tbsp Red Pepper Flakes (Spice Islands)  - About 1 tablespoon total
Â½ Cup Shredded mozzarella for tops
Followed the recipe â€“ I chop the Bell tops to equal 1 cup, I add the garlic and about half the SF/Cajun/Red Pepper flakes with the mixture.  When I get to step 10, I add all of the ingredients except the rice, stir taste and add the rest of the seasoning to taste â€“ then add the rice.  Before you add the cheese, taste again for seasoning needs.  Add Cheddar â€“ Taste again as this will pretty much taste as serve.  Adjust.
Bake for 30 minutes.  Sprinkle Â½ cup mozzarella.  Bake 5 more minutes.  Yum!",,

Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!",,
1208642,1356,2009-11-11,5,This is the 4th stuffed pepper recipe I have tried on this site - and it was the best one yet.  I used a cup of water instead of a half - and used some mexican tomato sauce for flavor on the tops.  It was VERY good - Thank you Cindy.,,

My alterations: red and orange bell peppers instead of green; chicken instead of beef; minced dried onion instead of fresh (less dried onion than is called for with fresh); Italian stewed tomatoes instead of plain diced tomatoes; mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.

Two thumbs up from very picky DH!!!  It's going on my permanent rotation!

BTW, it takes at least 50 minutes just for cooking rice and bake time.  Then add prep time and browning meat.

Red & orange bells make it a sweeter dish!  Absolutely superb!",,

143721,1356,2010-09-11,5,Very nice and tasty recipe.  The only change I made was I used a can of tomatoes with chiles.  Gave it just a bit of heat which was very nice.  All enjoyed and have requested that I do this again and soon.  Thanks for a great new stuff pepper recipe.,,

Yesterday I cleared out my garden and had a dozen small peppers, so used all of them for this recipe. Now I have 6 in my freezer for a quick meal later.

535033,1356,2010-12-29,0,"Easy, simple, yummy!!!  Would definitely make again.  I forgot the chese, but it was still good.  I also parboiled the bell peppers anywhere for 1 - 3 minutes (flipping them over in the middle).  I did not add the bell pepper trimmings this time, but I would next time.  DH loved them too.  Was surprised at how easy they were to make.  Oh, the rice was a little uncooked (maybe I used the wrong kind?), so I would cook the rice at least half way next time, too.",,

They were also a very pretty and colorful dish. I made them exact to the recipe but added a bit more cheese and a tad more water. The only problem was I didnt make enough! :D  Next time, I will have to make more. I ate one pepper and it was very filling. Thank you for an awesome recipe! :)",,
1530179,1356,2011-12-15,4,"I really enjoyed this entree.  I did put in 1 cup of precooked rice instead of a half cup of dry rice and added a tablespoon of minced garlic, and a little oregano and basil.

I add a little spice as well, and a tiny bit of brown sugar to offset it and it's lovely!<br/><br/>One thing that I do to save time (and dishes) is, when the ground beef and everything is cooking in my frying pan, I steam the peppers by inverting them and placing them on top of the ground beef. I leave them there for about 10 minutes, and voila! Perfectly steamed peppers!<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing!",,
178742,1356,2012-03-05,5,"Absolutely loved this recipe! I especially like that after cutting the tops off of the peppers, they were diced up and added to ground beef along with the onions! I used red, yellow and orange peppers, because we do not care for the green. I HIGHLY recommend cooking rice separately. So since I did cook rice separately from the ground beef, I omitted adding the water to the ground beef mixture. Therefore, just heating it about 10 minutes to heat the entire mixture once the tomatoes added.  Also I used our favoite Uncle Ben's, long grain wild rice w/broccoli. After rice cooked I just added it to the ground beef/onion/pepper/tomatoe mixture, then threw in the cheese and then stuffed my peppers. I had alot of the rice/beef mixture left so I did as another suggested and spread in the baking dish along with the peppers. This was soooooo good! Thanks for sharing.",,
372395,1356,2012-05-12,5,"YUM!  One comment -- parboiling 5 minutes made them a little too well done for me.  After I saw how much they'd cooked, I plunged them in ice water and they were fine. Next time think I'd only cook them about 3 minutes and then check.  Like them to be cooked but still firm when all finished.  After reading another reviewers input, I decided to go a little bit South American, so added Saizon seasoning mix and sofrito to the onion, pepper, beef mix. Gave a great flavor.  One other thing I changed was that I added 3 T Nuefchatel (cream cheese) to the cooked beef/tomato mix and stirred. Then added in cooked rice (used more than in recipe) and some cooked quinoa I had on hand.  Gave it a great creaminess without the heaviness of too much cheddar.  I sprinkled just a bit of cheddar blend on top of each one at end of baking, and we thought they were perfect.  Thanks for posting... don't know why it's been so long since I made stuffed peppers. Will definitely add them back to a more regular spot on the rotation!!",,
838632,1356,2012-07-07,5,"This was delicious and easy!  I made several changes due to what I had in my pantry/fridge.  I used 1 lb ground seasoned chicken, 1 small yellow onion, 1/2 cup of green pepper and  added 1/4 cup of fresh parsley and a touch of garlic salt.   For the cheese, I did 1/2 cup mozzarella and half cup of grated parmesan.  I did not have tin foil, so I put 2 inches of water at the bottom of my baking dish.  In the last 5 minutes of cooking, I put 2 tablespoons of sauce over each pepper.  During that 5 min, I put 2 more tablespoons of sauce into an empty bowls and served each pepper on the sauce.",,

That being said, I will fix these in the future for both of us as I finally found a recipe that I even like.  I did have to alter the recipe a bit as I didn't have any onions, so in place of the onions I chopped up some celery and mushrooms - used red & yellow instead of green peppers and doubled the cheese (you can never have too much cheese :) ), I also used diced tomatoes with green chilies and added about 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce.  Excellent flavor with just a bit of a kick.  Thank you Cindy for finally giving me a recipe for stuffed peppers I'll look forward to making again and again.",,
2547780,1356,2012-12-07,5,"These were delish! Like other users, I found that I needed to use more water and cook longer to ensure the rice was done (maybe about twice as much of both); however, I also used risotto, which could have made the difference. Other substitutions included ground chicken instead of beef, and tomato sauce instead of tomatoes (just don't like 'em!). Based on others' comments about blandness, I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and more salt than was called for. Definitely was not bland! Served with some nice crusty baguette.

This recipe was a hit I changed a few things slightly instead of using uncooked rice uncle Bens make a microwaveable cup of rice(I was working nights and had to go no time to wait on the rice to cook), I added a little more cheese, onions, and bell peppers  into the mixture. And topped it with cheese this recipe is a sure winner and will be added to my rotation. Even as a leftover it was fun to eat!

I did find the filling to be a tad bland, so I followed a few of another reviewers suggestions and added garlic salt, onion powder, and more Worcester. I also used a can of hot rotel in place of the tomatoes and it provided plenty of kick. I had to keep adding water as the rice absorbed it to keep it from sticking to the pan and to let it cook completely. I also used red bell peppers rather than green. They&#039;re just a slight bit sweet, which goes great with the spicy filling. Great base recipe to build on.",,
2834763,1356,2013-05-24,2,Flavor wasn&#039;t too bad but the rice was crunchy when following the recipe as it is written. Next time I make this I will definitely kick it up a few notches by adding a little more seasoning and precooking the rice.,,

Hopefully, it will be ready by then because I already have my oven preheated to 350&deg;. I have a gas range and oven. Was the recipe cooked, and baked in an electric range? When I tasted the mixture to assure that the rice was tender, it tasted great, but the rice was still hard. My range is high end, and I was cooking the ingredients on the Ultra Power Burner. All the liquid had evaporated, which would have been fine if the rice would have been ready, so I switched it to a regular burner after adding a little water. It was starting to stick. Let&#039;s see. I&#039;m an experienced cook, and I realize that recipes sometimes need tweeting depending upon ingredients used, and range/oven differences. Also, I live in the Midwest. Also, I have a home in the tropics, and weather conditions can vary results. I think that the recipe will be fine once the rice is ready, and the baking is finished. Let&#039;s see!",,

2000399378,1356,2015-08-12,5,"The best stuffed peppers I have EVER had.  I followed the recipe except used garden tomatoes diced up, I used chicken stock instead of water, added 3 Jalapeno peppers and some hot sauce.   These will be the only ones I make and great for summer when you have lots of bell peppers.",,

I cooked my rice separately, then added it to my meat mixture.  :)",,
2000412987,1356,2015-08-19,5,This was awsome! I never really liked stuff peppers but I love this. I added a few things. I added taco seasoning and corn and black beans. My husband who is Mexican loved it. I made my own salsa and guacamole to put on top of them too. So good!!,,
2000439447,1356,2015-08-29,5,I used organic brown rice and quinoa pouche instead of rice. The rice and quinoa is  precooked with additional seasoning. Added finely chopped brococoli and carrots for nutrition. My picky husband liked it?,,
2000447331,1356,2015-09-01,5,Fantastic. Just finished a dinner of these. Wifey says this recipe is a keeper. I found the filling was just right for 3 1/2 peppers which is great cause there&#039;s only 2 of us.,,
2000452142,1356,2015-09-04,0,"First time making stuffed peppers. I&#039;m very new to cooking anything! Been at it only a few months. Strong recipe.  I made a few modifications to mine to suite taste - 

1. Used 1 teaspoon of soy sauce instead of straight salt. It gave some additional flavor to the meat with less salt.
2. Instead of chopped bell peppers in the filling. I used chopped serrano chillies. We like our food very hot!
3. I Added 2 teaspoons minced garlic to the filling.
3. After baking, I topped with a spicy maraneria sauce and Mozzarella cheese and placed back into thr oven until the cheese was melted.

I FINALLY got cudos from my guy for my cooking. He said it was the best I have cooked to date. Usually he throws away my left overs... Tonight he packed the left overs for lunch tomorrow!

Thank you for your help!",,

As other reviews suggested, I used precooked rice. I tasted the meat mixture before stuffing the peppers and was very disappointed. I added some garlic and a TON of taco seasoning to try and spruce it up. Even after that, it still felt like it was missing something. Good try but it was very boring as the original recipe.",,

1247353,1356,2016-06-15,4,"This is my go to base recipe for stuffed peppers. I give it 4 stars only because it doesn't have enough flavour. To the rice mixture I add some extra seasoning - italian blend, dried basil, fresh cilantro, some pasta sauce, a bit of sugar and a healthy dose of sriracha hot sauce. I have no problem with rice cooking, but I will also note I use 19oz can of tomatoes, which may give the rice the extra liquid to cook.

I added dehydrated onions and garlic instead of chopping them up. I used petite diced tomatoes 14oz. I also added in a little frozen corn. Cooked it 30 mins covered with aluminum foil. Then I took off the aluminum foil and turn up the heat to make the cheese a little crisp. Next time I might make with Ground Turkey to lower the calorie content.",,

2001131395,1356,2016-08-17,5,"These were delicious! I added many more seasonings that the recipes states while cooking the ground beef in the skillet because I prefer well-seasoned food (i.e. Soul seasoning from Shoppers, garlic powder, garlic salt, season salt, etc.). Also, I incorporated both mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese in the beef mixture and on top. **Helpful hint: Make sure when you arrange the peppers on the baking sheet before putting them in the oven, that you pack them tightly side-by-side or else they will tip over. A couple times while they cooking I had to open the oven and reposition them, which all could have been avoided... Although this may have only happened before I packed so much beef mixture into each pepper. I wanted so much of the deliciousness in one serving! :-)",,
2000647589,1356,2016-08-24,5,I added a tin of tomato paste mixed with water. This made the sauce thicker and a very nice tomato flavor. I also added some additional spices.,,

2000391889,1356,2016-08-31,5,I have made these twice and they are wonderful! Both times I used the exact ingredients and &quot;eyeballed&quot; the measurements. I would highly recommend mixing the cheese into the rice/tomato/meat mixture near the last few minutes of the simmer. It really helps the peppers not rely on just the cheese on the top :),,

2001223291,1356,2016-10-28,5,"One of my favorite recipes. I did change it slightly. I precook the rice, and use brown rice, and then skip the water. I used 2 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce, and add 1 tsp. of chili powder, which makes a huge difference in flavor. I don't mix in the cheese, and only top the stuffed peppers with cheese. I used seasoned diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano.",,
2001237369,1356,2016-11-08,4,"Great, basic instructions. For the rice, I used 1.5 cups water instead to thoroughly cook rice, put toothpick holes at bottom of peppers to avoid over saturated peppers with fat juice, and added spicy black beans with corn to add flavor.

I doubled the rice (maybe that's why I felt the need to add a lot of seasonings) which I cooked separately, but it filled perfectly in the peppers. I did add a bit of milk when I thought it dry.

Of course, you can never find the nice flat bottomed peppers when you're looking for the perfect shape to stuff. I always end up with the most difficult shapes to stuff and stand. The bundt pan makes it a non-issue. Also, my mom always put about a quarter inch of water in the bottom of the baking pan to keep the peppers from burning on the bottom. It works great that way, but sometimes I kind of like the crunchy bottoms.",,

Also, lined each pepper with a slice of pepper jack cheese (cheddar would be good too) then added the beef mixture on and top and baked 25 min. Topped with another slice and returned to the oven for 5 minutes. I loved the idea of boiling the peppers before hand as that really perked up the color and crispness of the peppers.

To make 8 instead of 6 add 1# of ground sausage and a an 8oz. can of Garlic, Basil Tomato Sauce. Follow recipe and enjoy!",,
2001659820,1356,2017-08-06,0,My dad (a chef) did things slightly different. He 'blanched' the peppers to soften them so that they would not break when stuffing. He also made a rice and ground beef filing first. You can add spices and other ingredients as you please. He then would take the uncooked ground beef and rice mixture and gently line the inside of each pepper and fill the bottom of the pepper to about 1/4. He then placed a large piece of WHITE extra sharp cheddar (use Kraft Vermont or other but it must be white). He finished filling each pepper with the raw beef and rice mixture. The poured about 1-2 TBSP of pasta sauce over the filled pepper and then placed another thick slice of white cheddar on top of that and pour more pasta sauce over that. He cooked it in the over covered for about 50-60 minutes where the rice would could in the ground beef drippings as well as the cheese inside would melt. Of course the cheese on top would also melt. I would recommend 90% - 95% beef versus the usual 80/20. You do not want too much fat. But the juices continue to cook the pepper as well as the rice. When served have a side of pasta sauce. When you cut open the pepper the White Cheddar cheese mixed with the ground beef and rice would just run. The White cheddar has a different flavor and chemically creates a very different flavor than the orange cheddar. Growing up we had a tradition that my family was allowed to have their favorite dinner for their birthday and mine was always Dad's stuffed bell peppers.,,

IT TURNED OUT GREAT, wife rated it a 8 out of 10. We had reason for the edits, we stopped eating ground beef years ago for health reasons, and used ground turkey ever since, which is a lot healthier and because we used turkey, that meant no grease, which rice would have absorbed and cooked in, so we put rice under it.

The dish had a very fresh taste to it that i liked, I was in the mood to eat something nice and fresh and juicy. But then 2nd batch I made in my Webber Kettle, uncooked, I just brushed the peppers with a flavour infused olive oil, and dusted the inside of the pepper with Italian smoked paprika. And Wow what a different taste, nutty, spicy. I do like to dry fry my foods, meaning very little good quality olive oil, or coconut oil, even better. And here is the twist, use roasted chick pea and dollop of sour cream. Cilantro chopped up or yogurt, I have done breakfast the same way just filled with fresh organic eggs, shallots or spring onion with a bit of turmeric.

The only difference is after I drain the meat I add stewed tomatoes (chopped) then the rice and water 1 cup each cover and summer for 25 minutes or till water is absorbed and rice is cooked. Then instead of adding cheddar cheese I use Velveeta cheese. It melts right into the meat and rice mixture, I stir together stuff peppers and put into oven for 30 minutes. I got this recipe from my Betty Crocker cook book over 40 years ago and the only change I made was the Velveeta cheese and using stewed tomatoes (they have extra seasoning in them already) because that's what I had on hand",,

2002249761,1356,2018-08-17,3,"Very bland! I added more flavor and I'm so glad I did! Way more Worcestershire sauce, a little garlic salt, fresh diced mushrooms, fire roasted diced tomatoes (instead of regular ones), and I put some salsa and sour cream on it right before serving it! This is a great &quot;base&quot; recipe which I can also respect because it leaves room for the cook to add what they think will work. I would suggest not just cooking it by the book, get creative or it will be underwhelming.",,
2002234024,1356,2018-08-19,5,"This is an AWESOME recipe! So easy and surprisingly my son enjoyed it. I did not use rice to make it low carb and when I stuffed the pepper I would alternate between beef and cheese -- so it is like a pasta but inside of a green pepper. Also I bought spicy pasta sauce and used that instead as it gave it a bit of a kick without it being overly spicy. Also I do not boil the green peppers, but put them straight into the over at the tempterature stated and let it cook for longer. Doing it this way softens the pepper just enough without it becoming mushy (which frankly, is disgusting). Oh and you don't have to use green peppers, if you want some color try red, yellow or even orange. One more change, I don't use cheddar cheese but either a two or three cheese blend. I find cheddar doesn't melt very well and using a two or three cheese blend you get better taste.",,

This recipe was very easy to follow which is great because I'm a stay at home wife with 3 small children, and dinners can be a challenge at time. So thank you. I tweaked the recipe just a little. I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of the regular diced. And I also used sheredded velveeta mozzarella cheese instead of the cheddar cheese. Which made it nice and creamy. All in all this dinner was a hit in my home and will be made again in the future.",,

To the other reviewer who gave the unnecessary 1-star rating - you stated the meat came out dry.  Try baking in an oven (convection if you have it) and place the meat on a cookie sheet.  Add water to the bottom of the pan below the cookie sheet (or in a separate pan if you are putting it on a baking pan) to keep moisture in the oven. 

Cooking only takes 30-45 minutes if you slice it thin enough.

I did find them to be a bit too sweet so I will reduce the sugar by a 1/4 Cup next time. I  like how quick and simple they are to prepare.  Thx for sharing this truebrit!,,

8629,1438,2010-06-19,5,These are really great.  Loved the ease of preparation. I had to make these twice in one day because I gave away the first batch and my son wanted more than just the one I gave him from the first batch. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine.  I was requested to make them without nuts so I bumped up the amount of chocolate chips to between 3/4 to 1 cup.  I had a little trouble discerning when they were fully baked.  I was afraid of over cooking them. I had to put back the first batch to cook longer because the inside was still raw.  I baked mine in a 9 inch by 13 inch glass dish. I will make these again.,,

I had to bake mine a bit longer, since they where not quite done in the center, but they turned out great, and tasted even better the next day, only thing is not many made it to the next day!  LOL  I used 2 cups chocolate chips, no nuts our preference.  A very nice bar recipe. Thanks.",,
635656,1438,2012-02-12,5,I made mine with Valentine colored M & Ms and whole wheat flour.  I cut them into heart shapes with my son for his Valentine Day treat to share with his friends.  They turned out great!  Yum!,,

2000264985,1438,2015-06-12,5,"I made these by directions, they seemed a bit greasy and maybe not so good day of baking.......BUT the next day. Wow they were great! My picky daughter loved them!

157663,1465,2004-11-07,5,I was not sure about the cinnamon as I have never used cinnamon before in a raisin pie recipe.But its very tasty. My new favorite.,,
271221,1465,2006-01-10,5,"I have never considered raisin pies among my favorites -- until now! When I learned we had three unopened boxes of raisins in the cupboard I decided to give it a try and take it to a covered dish dinner tonight. I read most of the recipes and decided on this one primarily because it incorporat ed orange juice, orange zest and cinnamon, which were unique to this recipe. The result was outstanding with just enough tartness to make a big difference from most other recipes -- it even garnered praise from people who didn't like raisin pie! The results belie the ease of preparation. Definitely a repeater. Too bad we aren't allowed a sixth star!

One comment -- I was fearful the finished product would be too watery so I poured off most of the unabsorbed liquid after plumping the raisins. Next time I will include all the liquid.

37868,1481,2002-09-15,5,"Family has gave this a 5 Star. They just loved the taste. The onions and the green pepper was just the start of it. Added the thyme and lemon juice put just the right twist on it for a new taste with squash. This is a keeper. Not hard to remember will be easy to repeat over and over.
Thank You",,
71721,1481,2003-02-11,5,I loved it.  I added 1 cup mustard greens instead of the green pepper.  I also added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  Delicious.  I will do this recipe frequently.,,

It is a keeper and I will be making it again. Thanks.",,
87646,1481,2004-06-12,4,"Except for the thyme, I liked this recipe.  Using lemon juice and adding green peppers with squash I thought was really tasty, but I think I'll experiment with a different spice. Thanks!",,

540346,1481,2009-07-19,4,My husband really liked this.  I used a banana pepper and cooked everything in olive oil.   Next time I will try it with butter and I think it will be even better.,,

3858,1506,2002-07-02,2,"I didn't make any substitutions to the recipe.
It was a very disappointing taste for regular garden salad.  We modified our salads at the dinner table and added strawberries - that helped a lot.  I think adding mandarin oranges and walnuts or cashews to the salad would be good with this dressing.",,
738401,1507,2011-12-04,5,Great!  I've made this a couple of times and love how much body it has.  I like to use oil and then needed to eliminate most of the water.

804550,1521,2011-12-27,5,I'm giving this recipe 5-stars for taste. I omitted the pimientos. I also made this for a neighborhood potluck luncheon and it was very well received. Made for Let's PARTY tag.,,

157425,1522,2006-05-24,5,We really enjoyed these enchiladas. Instead of black beans I used a can of mexican dark red beans and shredded the chicken instead of cutting into bite size pieces. So easy to make!,,
358974,1522,2007-05-12,5,"These are delicious! Not too hot, with good flavor and texture. I added pinto as well as black beans, as I'm a big bean fan. These were great to freeze, too; I made about two dozen and they thaw well.",,
291344,1522,2007-07-22,5,Very tasty!!  I added corn but otherwise stuck to the recipe.,,

This is an absolutely delicious recipe.  I used salsa in the enchiladas and enchilada sauce over the top, had green pepper instead of red, skipped bacon the first time and added rice the second time (because I was using leftovers from a weekend fiesta).  Either way, any way, whatever you add, these are simply delicious.  I froze the enchiladas cooked, then reheated in the microwave for lunch.  Very nice!  I also froze some extra filling by itself and that worked even better for us.  Thanks for a new family favorite.",,
415934,1522,2008-11-21,5,"These were a great hit!  Because picante sauce is just a term made up by Pace for their salsa, I used chunky salsa instead. These were great. I will make them again and again.  The only changes I made to the recipe were leaving out the bell pepper and the bacon and I also put the cooked chicken in the food processor for a few pulses to sorta shred it.  Then I  put it back in the pan and added the black beans.

Thanks so much for this recipe.",,
1185323,1522,2009-06-24,0,Loved it. It was a hit with my kids and my husband said he felt like he was eating at a mexican restaurant. I used Goya Canned Black Beans and I added white rice and olives to the receipe. I also used Taco Bell Medium Taco Sauce as the picante. I will definitely make this again.,,
1267330,1522,2009-07-19,5,"Wow, this was great!  I love the fact that this can be made into a healthy recipe.  I used low fat cheese and wraps and they were excellent, even for those husbands that don't fancy the ""low fat junk"" he loved it!!  I used chilli powder instead of cumin and I ommited the bacon.  I also used (low fat) cheddar cheese because it was all I had at the time.  Can't wait till we have it again.... thanks so much!",,
495793,1522,2009-07-20,4,"This was a good recipe.  I like using the bacon grease to for the chicken, left it really moist.  I really don't think the bacon added anything to this dish.  I even used good thick bacon with a lot of flavor.  At the end of the day, I would leave out the bacon.  The rest of the flavors were great.  I would add a little more spice (heat) to the dish.  I would also saute the peppers with the chicken a little longer to soften them up or use roasted red peppers to really add a great flavor.  Overall a good dish and a great starting point for a lot of different options.",,
326543,1522,2009-10-08,5,"WOW, this will be going directly to the favoites book. It was even better reheated the second day. I think it would be great to triple and use for OAMC. I did not use the bacon greese to cook the chicken but thought that there was pleanty of bacon flavor.",,
465080,1522,2009-10-26,5,"This was a big hit this evening!  I used turkey bacon and skipped the red peppers.  I didn't bake them, either, as I used ""Recipe#69612"" rather than store bought.  I'd say that this serves 4 adults.  Yum!",,
1411574,1522,2009-10-31,5,Excellent Enchiladas! I used already cooked chicken breast strips from Costco to shorten the cook time and just heated it thru with the rest of the ingredients. They made great leftovers as well...I had all my coworkers drooling!!,,
214991,1522,2009-11-02,5,What a fantastic dish! I used green pepper and it worked out fine. Thanks for sharing.,,
917666,1522,2009-11-04,5,I was REALLY surprised with how simple and delicious this recipe was!  I substituted bacon bits to make it even easier and it was a hit with the family.  I've made it twice now and have added it to my cookbook.  Thanks!,,
1168645,1522,2009-12-22,5,"This is a really good recipe.  I did make some changes for a few reasons. I used canned chicken breasts because I was trying to test to see if this would be easy enough to make while camping. I still cooked it in the pan with garlic it just didnt cook as long. I doubled the garlic.. we are garlic fans round here. I used green enchilada sauce in lieu od picante sauce.  I like it better.  I also mixed in a few tablespoons of sour creme in with the 1/2 cup enchilada sauce to make it more like chicken sour cream enchiladas.  I also, based off another enchilada recipe I had my eye on spread the bottom of my baking sheet with a small layer of sour cream before placing the enchiladas in the pan.  Next time I make this I am omitting the red bell peppers... I ended up picking them out and my husbands wasnt a fan of them either... I will probably put in diced onion in with the chicken and garlic in lieu of red bell pepper.  We are also big fans of onion around here!  ;)",,
161825,1522,2009-12-28,5,This is so good. We used the picante sauce and then also put a can of enchilada sauce on it too cause we like them saucy and it was a bit dry for us but other than that is was a awesome dinner!,,
1325202,1522,2010-08-03,5,This was a great recipe! I've made it a couple of times now and both times everyone really enjoyed them!,,
108807,1522,2011-04-03,5,"Hopping on the bandwagon... these are some tasty enchiladas!  I subbed regular onions for green and upped the garlic, but didn't add any cheese inside the enchiladas (I didn't have enough, and I figured it would be lower-calorie that way anyway.)  I like a creamy enchilada, so I worried these would be dry, but they tasted divine.  The little bit of bacon gave these a great flavor. Thanks! This will go in my recipe rotation.",,
126032,1524,2005-06-02,5,Wow!  These were good!  I used flour tortillas instead of corn and also added a little adobo seasoning to the sour cream mix.I only used five flour tortillas since they are larger than corn tortillas and they fit perfectly into a 8 X 8 X 2 baking pan. The recipe didn't state when to add the last 1/2 cup of cheese so I baked the enchiladas for 30 minutes and then added the rest of the cheese and baked for 10 mins. more.  Turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe Gilcat2!,,
111520,1524,2007-07-28,4,"Excellent easy enchiladas - Even tho I did not refrigerate -- also used mozzarella instead of cheddar so that the other flavors would not be drowned out. So good, so fattening, but I didn't care!",,

1505221,1527,2010-03-18,5,"This was excellent. Along with the tomatillos, when I boiled them I also boiled three jalapeÃ±o peppers. When I took them out of the water I cut them open and removed the seeds because I prefer my enchiladas mild to medium spicy. I also took the chicken after boiling it and cooked it a little in a pan with some yellow onion, some pepper and a little bit of chili powder before putting it into the enchiladas. I roll the enchiladas up and put them into a baking dish (mine fits 12) and then cover it with the rest of the green sauce and cheese, then I bake it in a 350 oven for 25-30 minutes until it is bubbly and delicious.",,

This has to be the best Chili I've made or tasted. The red onions at the end add a very nice sweet and crunchy texture in your mouth too. The only thing I will do the next time I make this recipe - make a loaf of toasted garlic bread on the side.

565650,1541,2010-05-15,4,"Very tasty dish that is simple and quick. Start with a little fresh minced  garlic and ginger and flavor your oil and flavor your whole dish at the same time. Used 8 large raw shrimp as it was a serving for 2. Do not use cooked shrimp and when cooking the shrimp, juices will be released from the raw shrimp that will flavor your whole dish. I shredded up some cabbage leaves very finely as I was out of fresh bean sprouts. The cabbage shreds and eggs were added right at the end so the cabbage would retain a great green color and not get mushy.

I was a bit dubious when I read the ingredients and prep involved -- seemed way too simple, but when I tried one of the peppers after refrigeration the next day -- wow!

When I came home w/ haddock he went right to the computer, logged on to my account on 'zaar and searched for haddock recipes.  (I'm so proud of him :-)).  This is the recipe he decided on and was it ever yummy!  There were only 3 of us eating tonight so I only purchased 1 fillet which was 1 Â¼ pounds.  My DH adusted the recipe for 3 servingsâ€¦ so perhaps we had more topping than the recipe intended but we thought it was a perfect amount.  He used a liberal shake of red pepper flakes in lieu of cayenne pepper.   The recipe did not mention anything about the skin.....my DH placed the haddock skin-side down in the baking dish, and hoped the fish would seperate from the skin like it does when grilling.  However the skin came along with the fillet so we just took our bites from the top, scraping them off the skin.  I think I'll ask the fish guy to remove the skin for me next time I buy haddock.   My 12 year old DS thought the fish was too spicy, not â€˜spicy hotâ€™ but just too spicy.  We scraped the topping off but he still just pickedâ€¦.his loss!  DH served with basmati rice and a salad.

My only complaint is I found the term ""batter"" to be misleading. I would describe it more as ""crumbs"". This wasn't a problem when making the crust, you just press them into the pan, but it did make it difficult to prepare the lattice top. Next time I would either add a small amount of water to the reserved crumbs to form more of a pastry dough before rolling out or just sprinkle the crumbs on top. I also noticed they tasted better and were moister the second day so I would recommend baking them the day before you are going to serve them. ",,

They are just like homemade fudge except that they never fail. I have made what I think are a couple of improvements to the recipe. After the milk and sugar and butter have cooked for 10 min., instead of adding the choco chips next, I whisk in the flour and let it cook a min or so to get rid of the rawness, then continue as written with the addition of 1/2 C of smooth peanut butter along with the choco, cracker crumbs, nuts and vanilla.

I recommend dividing the dough into two flattish loafs since mine didn't cook all the way through and it was in the oven for a little over half an hour.

This is terrific! I am up alot at night so keeping up with Zaar is one of the things I do.  Came across this recipe last night and had to make it immediately as I had all the ingredients on hand.  Used SMart Balance for margarine and WheyLow brown sugar--otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Well, I guess not.  I put it in a ceramic rectangular pan sprayed with PAM rather than using  foil. Had to have a piece right away.  Came out of the pan with ease and tasted AWESOME.  The cookie part was probably the best oatmeal cookie I've had in ages.  Can already think of a number of variations. Apple raisin /cinnamon; cherry almond; pumpkin spice.  Anyway thank you for a great midnight snack.

I used canola oil instead of butter as we are dairy free, white sugar for the sugar, egg replacer and orange juice for the liquid in the egg as well as to replace the milk like a couple other reviewers did as well. I used desiccated (smaller than shredded) coconut but believe flaked would be better in this. I used Recipe #256259 for the flour and gluten free baking powder and sea salt for the salt. I forgot to grease my glass baking dish so it stuck like crazy but even though it broke into millions of pieces because of that, it was very tasty and I would make this again though next time I would like to try with flaked coconut and raw cane sugar.

I used sweetened flaked coconut because that is what I had o hand but I forgot to cut the sugar back. I think that made the recipe a tad too sweet. When making again (and yes, I will make this again) I will cut the sugar back quite a bit if the coconut is sweetened. Thanks Dreamgoddess for such a tasty recipe.

To get it a little moister, simply cover the pan with foil as soon as it comes out of the oven while cooling.  Another tip...if you are using sweetened coconut flakes, cut the sugar back in half.  <br/><br/>Great recipe.  Thank you!",,
844554,1602,2015-04-11,5,Very good coconutty dessert! I doubled the ingredients and baked in a 8x8 pan after reading the reviews since we like it thicker also. I only used orange juice not milk and cut down on the sugar. We love it!,,

I used short grain brown rice, and while I was concerned that it would take longer to cook or be dry it was easily cooked in the hour and a half listed as the cooking time and wasn't in the least bit dry to my tastes.  Slicing intead of chopping the onions is a wonderful touch.  Onions are often slimy in recipes like this but these were perfect.
I only hade one problem in this recipe.  I cooked it uncovered and the tomatoes that were on top burned horribly.  They were inedible and I had to throw them out.  This wasn't too much of a problem for us since the dish was still excellent, and my husband and daughter aren't big tomato fans but I thought I'd mention it anyway. I think next time I might just add a little bit of tomato juice instead of the tomatoes since as near as I can tell the juice is the only thing that added anything to the dish.",,

I didn't have a can of tomatoes, so instead I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and poured it on top. Following that, I sliced up a couple of fresh tomatoes and put them on top.

383557,1832,2007-03-01,4,"I made this last night and it was very good.  I've been using the same Kung Pao recipe for years and this was a nice change.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. I marinated the chicken as directed but I changed the veggies.  Same amount but I added zucchini and left out the celery.  I used a little less green pepper and a little more onion.  I didn't have any hot peppers on hand so I left them out and made up for the volume with the zucchini.  Today I found some fresh water chestnuts at the store and bought those.  You have to peel them and they aren't nearly as cheap as the ones in a can but they are so much better.  They are sweet and juicy and to me they taste almost exactly like jicama.  Sort of a cross between a potato and an apple.  I'll use these some time this weekend for another Chinese dish.

The veggies aren't really what a Kung Pao recipe is about anyway.  It's about the sauce and the chiles.  This is what attracted me to this recipe out of the many that are on this website.  I doubled the amount.  Otherwise I made it pretty much to spec but when I tasted it before adding to the dish it was way too strong for my tastes.  I'm quite used to flavor-packed Asian dishes, especially Thai and Indian curries.  But I've ordered this dish in restaurants many times and I thought the sauce was just too intense.  So I thinned it a bit with some chicken stock and then added corn starch to help it thicken.  I probably added 2/3 cup, give or take.  It was still full of flavor and tasted about right.  I also added some Thai chile garlic sauce to the sauce mix for more heat and chile flavor.  This recipe usually has dried red chiles, (whole) added to the hot oil before adding the chicken and you cook until the chiles just start to brown.  Leave them in for a dramatic effect but warn your guests that they aren't really good to eat.  I suppose you can eat them but they're really just dry and nearly burned.  

 I used crushed red peppers,(out of whole dried peppers too) several cloves of garlic and 1 or 2 tablespoons of minced ginger to the oil before cooking the chicken. Adding ginger and garlic to the hot oil is pretty common with Chinese stir fried dishes and really adds great flavor to the meat.  

As I said, Kung Pao is mostly about the sauce and the chiles.  I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I really think it needs to be diluted a bit to make it more authentic.  Chicken stock is perfect for this but you'll want to add a little corn starch, maybe a couple of tablespoons, so that it will thicken when you cook it.

For the muffins I fried them up and used a lid to get the centers to cook. These have great flavor and sizzled in the toaster. I think this has spoiled the family and they will not look at store bought the same. I read the longer you let the dough rise the more holes. I will keep trying to get the right texture. I read on another recipe to heat up 1 cup of water in the microwave, then let to dough rise in the hot/moist microwave(not on). This worked really well.",,
345915,1873,2012-10-30,0,Yummy easy bread.  I did add an egg and 3 tbsp butter.  I used the idea to boil water in the micro and then put the bread in to rise with the micro off & it rose in 45 min.  Easier to make than the muffins.  I tried to use the dough hook but would recommend the paddle to mix in the stand mixer.  Enjoy!,,
6164,1878,2001-03-01,0,"Here is one more way of doing this and the same can also be used as an excellent 
accompaniment to any dish. 
Dice nearly 10-12 medium sized onions and keep aside. 
Take a half litre yoghurt container. 
Add half teaspoon salt and half teaspoon coriander powder to the same. 
Mix the ingredients well to get a smooth consistency. 
Now put the onions in this curd mixture.
Chop a bunch of green coriander leaves or parsley and add to this.
Leave it aside for 45 minutes for the flavours to set in.
Salt can be adjusted to individual preferences.
Enjoy with steamed rice, sandwiches, hot pita bread or even with pastas. 
This also goes well as a dip with fritters.

Hope you enjoy the same.

or ""Devil Chutney""

1 medium onion
1 tsp  chillie powder
2 tsps  sugar
pinch  salt
1 tabsp lemon juice

In a liquidiser grind all ingredients to a smooth sauce. If too sweet adjust by adding more chillie powder. If too hot, add a bit more sugar. How easy  is that!
Another version of the above is to use only 1 tsp sugar and add 2 tsps sultanas. This makes it a thicker and darker sauce. Enjoy!

This is one of my favorite cakes--great to take to a pot luck, or office party.  It tastes
wonderful, packs well and everyone loves it.
The only difference is she used lard, my mother substituted Crisco when they boiled the
sugar (they used white sugar), water, raisins, etc. together. And of course, they did not
always have nuts on hand so they were omitted a lot.

It turned out great--a nice dense texture like old fashioned pound cakes should have. I never have brandy in my house so I used apple juice instead. Also, I left out the nutmeg and added a teaspoon of vanilla.

This cake kept well. Because I have a thing about bugs, we ""farbed"" out a little and used a large zip lock bag to store it in. I am fairly sure in the old days it would have been wrapped in cloth.",,

I like the twang of the sour cream, and I added 1 cup of parmesan cheese (the bottled kind). With real parmesan cheese, I can see this having a deeper taste, but bottled was all I had on hand. I love that this has less butter, so the end result was creamy w/o the added oil. But because of maybe that lack of extra oil, I had to thin the sauce a little bit (I like my alfredo sauce a little thinner than most). I used soy creamer (yes!), but you could have used half and half or milk. I added extra cracked pepper instead of crushed red pepper flakes and threw in a 1/4 tsp of finely chopped onion because I had to use it up. Very tasty!

I ate with iceberg lettuce mixed with mellowed red onions (soaked in lime juice for 1 hour), bean sprouts, radish and carrot, and some sesame marinated chicken breasts. The rice vinegar adds a good bite to the flavor, especially with the aforementioned onion prep. However, I see no need to spend so much time mincing the ingredients! Just give them a rough chop and toss into the processor/blender. As long as the pieces are small enough so that you do not whip too much air into the dressing when blending, you'll end up with a creamy emulsion, which is the goal.

465062,1985,2007-08-15,5,"I cannot believe how good this is. I have something similar to this before in a Japanese sushi restaurant.  It is sooooooo good. It is just amazing how close the taste is.
Thanks for the great great recipe. I will let my Japanese food crazy co-worker try this tomorrow and see what she will say.",,
538125,1985,2007-09-16,5,"I didnt add the celery because I didnt have any on hand. This dressing was delicious and a nice change from so many of the Soy based asian dressings. It was a delightful mix of ingredients. This one is a ""keeper"".",,
234925,1985,2007-09-27,5,I loved it!!                       I can't wait to have my cuz try it . She loves japanese food. Thanks so much todd,,
88047,1985,2007-10-06,5,"Very nice!  This dressing is one of the main reasons I go to some of my favorite asian restaurants.  Such a nice, refreshing change from the sesame based asian dressings on the market.  The onion and ginger give it such a great flavor and texture..Yum",,
567786,1985,2007-10-14,4,"This was very tasty. I usually use frozen ginger cubes, but I didn't have enough, so I had to sub in ginger powder, and it was still good. I will definitely try it again when I have more ginger cubes. Oh, and I too omitted the celeery because I don't like it.",,
289319,1985,2007-10-21,5,"This was great.  I didn't have peanut oil so I used canola.  Also no rice vinegar so I substituted red wine,  I do think the rice vinegar would be better though.  Oh and I don't like celery either so left that out.  It was really yummy!",,
636450,1985,2007-11-04,2,"This isn't the original Benihana salad dressing recipe. That is understandable, since it is hard to find. This spin on it probably taste's great, even though it has so many ingredients with such strong favors.",,
497077,1985,2008-01-21,5,This is one of my favorite dressings now!!! I haven't eaten Benihana's so I can't compare. I do like to use a little less than 1/2 cup of peanut oil and add about 2 T. of sesame oil but that's personal preference; it certainly is not needed. Soooooo good!!!,,
530501,1985,2008-03-01,5,Made it exactly as recipe stated. It was perfect. We go to Japanese restaurants frequently and this dressing tastes similar or exactly like the ones we've tasted. Love ginger dressing. This is the first time I've made it but no need to look for another recipe or change it. Thanks.,,
404560,1985,2008-03-31,5,"Fabulous! Amazing! Thank you, thank you, thank you. I too would give more stars if I could.",,
239626,1985,2008-04-18,5,This came very close to the ginger dressing at my favorite hibachi restaurant. I omitted the celery because I did not have any on hand. The next time I will try it with the celery. Clean and balanced flavor.,,
585796,1985,2008-05-11,3,"I have never been to Benihanas so I can't compare to that but it was definately not what I was looking for. It just didn't blend for us very well and was overwhelmingly strong. The DH liked it more than me so I figured I would be fair and rate it with 3 stars. For me, I just didn't care for it.",,
39782,1985,2008-05-11,4,"WOW! This was very, very good. The taste was incredible and I was very happy with the final outcome... I tried to make less of this (cut the recipe) and that was a mistake. Even after finely mincing each veggie (which I think in hindsight was a little overkill IMO) my processor didn't do well with cutting the recipe in half, impossibly chunky and hard to manage, so others be forewarned :) Amazingly, I was able to resuscitate by adding the original amounts right on top of my failed creation. I will definitely be making this again, thanks so much.",,
58439,1985,2008-05-12,5,"FANTASMO as can be!
This recipe IS for me!
IS Benihana's ginger salad dressing to a tee!
HIGHLY recommended by ME!
THANKS!",,
117184,1985,2008-05-18,5,"Yum!  We loved it.  I had 3 servings of salad because it was so delicious.  I didn't have the peanut oil so just used canola oil instead.  I also skipped the sugar since ketchup has sugar, and I am watching my sugar intake.  It was still delicious!",,
340776,1985,2008-05-19,5,This is so awesome!!! I made it ahead of time tonight for a dinner party tomorrow - I'm going to use it in a brown rice dish. I am thinking of adding a salad to the menu just to showcase this delicious dressing. Thanks so much! No bottled dressing compares.,,
739377,1985,2008-08-19,5,"Outstanding recipe!!  Really good, authentic taste, and very easy to make.  If you have food processor, don't worry about mincing the vegetables, it's not really necessary and just takes more time.  A regular chop will work nicely.

I saw that some people left out the celery.  I would make a point of including it.  It adds subtle flavor and important texture.  I also omitted the salt.  There's a ton of salt in the soy sauce, and no need for any more.  Also, if you don't use rice vinegar regularly, make sure you get the no sodium, no sugar variety.  There's a ""great for salad"" version out there that's loaded with salt and sugar, again, not needed.

Oh yeah, and what to do with that extra rice vinegar?  It makes a great, light tasting substitute in your favorite salad dressing.

Overall, great dressing.  Thanks!!",,
942873,1985,2008-09-02,4,"Delicious! I didn't put it in the blender and left out the celery. It was very tasty and has a bold, rich flavor. Just cut up your onion & ginger very small!",,

142335,1985,2009-01-19,5,"I've made this a couple times and love it. I usually follow the directions to a ""T"" with fantastic results. This last time, I didn't have everything and decided to make it anyway. While it was still good and I'm using it I felt there was a big difference in taste. I think the celery really adds to the recipe and I won't make this again unless I have everything I need. I enjoy this dressing over iceberg lettuce the best...just like it's served in the restaurants. For me, it's to strong served over other stronger greens.",,
680252,1985,2009-03-21,5,"Great dressing this is my favorite salad dressing, and now that I know I can make it, I will have it often. Thanks for sharing.",,

Karen",,
644191,1985,2009-04-27,5,Wow!  This was good.  I didn't have peanut oil so I used regular veg. oil.  When I tasted the recipe it didn't quite taste right so I added 1 tbsp of chunky peanut butter... perfect!  I agree it tasted authentic to me...,,
1348113,1985,2009-08-11,5,Fantastic!,,
447123,1985,2009-09-21,5,Simply AMAZING!!!! Truly I have made this twice and it is good each time. I didnt' have any peanut oil so what I did is used regular oil and a little peanut butter as one previous poster sugested. MUST TRY!! Thanks Todd!!,,
398121,1985,2009-09-29,1,Much better recipes elsewhere.,,
823814,1985,2009-10-12,5,Fantastic! I could eat this everyday and be happy. Tastes just like what you get at the restaurant. The only change was I added a little extra fresh ginger. I love ginger!,,
1365959,1985,2010-01-15,5,OMG!!! I have been obsessed with the dressing in Japanese restaurants for the longest time!! Now I can finally make it at home!! Thanks so much!,,
653438,1985,2010-01-24,5,Very delicious!!!  I cut the recipe down but followed it completely and it was a big hit.  I might add a little less peanut oil and add some sesame oil next time as previous reviewers suggested.  This was a definate keeper thank you.  Served over iceberg lettuce with some scallions and Recipe#92511#92511.  Made for a wonderful dinner!,,

728359,1985,2010-05-25,5,Delicious! Even the picky eaters I know LOVE this dressing! Thanks!,,
487971,1985,2010-06-21,5,"Very close to the Benihana version. I did have to add about 1 teaspoon more of soy sauce and about 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. You don't taste it at all, but it definitely added something that was missing!",,
308434,1985,2010-07-01,5,"This is a wonderful dressing!  Due to what I had on hand...I had to sub the peanut oil for extra virgin olive oil and for the celery...I chopped up a few leaves of my maggi plant (it smells and tastes like celery) and used ""recipe #216380"" ...left out the water..used Agave for the sugar and pureed with the stick blender.  The result was a creamy, thickish dressing.  It was lovely on our salad last night.  DH said it is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.",,
36810,1985,2010-08-14,5,"I had a taste for some ginger dressing, so I whipped this up in a very small batch.  It is totally awesome!  I have never been to Benihana's but this is the best tasting ginger dressing I have ever had - Thanks for a keeper, Todd!",,
1668302,1985,2010-08-22,2,"It does not taste like the Benihana dressing here in California, that I buy at Benihana by the quart.  It is too sweet.  A nice tasting dressing, but disappointingly not the same.",,
199020,1985,2011-01-21,5,"I've never been to the restaurant, but this is great dressing! Served over salad with miso soup and spicy tuna rolls and Philadelphia rolls. Thanks!",,
1242099,1985,2011-05-16,4,"I give this 4 stars for being a good, versatile dressing (salad dressing, or to dress up meat, veggies, or rice... a little goes a long way).  I say 3 stars for being a not-that-great knockoff of Benihana's dressing.  Benihana's dressing has a much more subtle flavor... this dressing is VERY flavorful... it has too much of something. I may experiment to figure it out, or I may just try to find a better Japanese Steakhouse or restaurant type dressing.  Unfortunately my husband didn't like it and none of my kids would eat it, so it would get a lower rating if it was up to them.  Since I like it I have a whole bottle for myself.  I will say that I did make a small substitution which I don't think is the whole reason this wasn't a better dressing.  I didn't have peanut oil.  I followed some reviewers suggestions to decrease the oil... I used 1/4 cup (about 2/3 of that canola and 1/3 sesame... the sesame oil has a very strong flavor and I would never do a 1:1 substitution).",,
738401,1985,2012-01-01,4,"Very good.  I've eaten at Benihana but do not remember the dressing so cannot comment on that.  I thought it needed an extra teaspoon of sugar upon tasting so adjusted that.  I love that it's nice and viscuous and thick, but not too thick.  Thanks for posting, this is a winner!",,
1632700,1985,2012-01-24,5,"Love this stuff. It goes great on an asian type slaw with carrots, water chestnuts and celery.",,
839730,1985,2012-03-24,5,"I wasn't sure about all the onion in this recipe, but I made it exactly as it says (except I couldn't find peanut oil and had to use canola).  It was SOOO good!  I put it on an iceberg lettuce, cucumber and tomato salad and it was awesome.  It's good on chicken too.  It's actually good on almost everything.  I will be making this dressing all the time.",,
485109,1985,2012-04-17,5,"We really enjoyed this salad dressing! It's been a while since we went to Benihana but as far as we can remember, it's pretty similar. When I first made it, there was a little too much of the ketchup flavour so I added a little more soy sauce and rice vinegar. Next time, I'll add a bit more ginger as well. We served it over lettuce with grated carrot and cabbage and grilled chicken breasts. A really good recipe- thanks!",,
400708,1985,2012-05-20,5,I LOVE Benihana and love this dressing.  Made for a great light salad and easy enough that DH mixed it up while I was fixing dinner.  We'll be using this one often.,,

674022,1985,2013-04-14,5,This was spot on perfect. It tasted exactly like the restaurant ginger salad dressing. I poured it over an iceberg lettuce salad with carrots just like Benihana and it was sooooooooo good. I love Todd Wilbur Top Secret recipes because they are so authentic. I will make this over and over. If you like to have Benihana taste at home this is a match for you. It makes a good amount so I will have several Benihana salads this week. Made ahead and refridgerated it to blend flavors and chill.  Love it! Thanks for posting Todd! Enjoy! We definitely did! ChefDLH,,
1179225,1985,2013-04-21,5,"Delicious and really simple to make. I halved the recipe and  was out of fresh ginger so I used about a 1 teaspoon of ground, also out of rice wine vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar and it still turned great.

I followed the directions with 2 exceptions, I used Olive Oil instead of Peanut Oil,and when it was blending, I added just a dollop of Sesame  Oil. The dressing came out fantastic, I served it over a spinach salad with sliced carrots and Smoked Pork Chop that was Julienned cut.  I also added just a bit to Ramen Noodles, that was really good, actully gave them some flavor",,
1800393644,1985,2013-12-04,5,Awesome!!! I did make a few adjustments to meet my needs. I used olive oil and a dash of sesame oil. I substituted the sugar for honey and added a carrot.

(I go easy on the sodium, so it&#039;s up to you.) Also, make sure you add some shredded carrots to the top of you salad to make it look authentic.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you Carmen B. for posting this delicious Ginger Salad Dressing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ps.

My mother has a peanut allergy so I substituted sesame oil instead which has a lovely nutty flavour and compliments the ginger well, and I had no rice vinegar so used malt vinegar and it worked fine. I also used pureed ginger and garlic from tubes which makes for easy preparation.",,

91283,1999,2003-12-21,5,"I had excellent results. I added a pinch of salt and a couple of tablespoons of butter and a few drops of red food coloring.

The first patties that I made were kind of sticky at first, but I covered them with a sheet of wax paper (loosely) and left them overnight. The consistency was good the next morning and the flavor was excellent -- improved over immediately after cooking.

I also added about a Tbsp of Worcester sauce and a tsp of prepared mustard to the sauce for a little more balanced flavor.

To speed up the process, while the meat was cooking, I cooked the cabbage about halfway in a pan of boiling water.

This is a good basic recipe...and allows for kicking it up a notch or not.

104295,2015,2007-06-14,4,We enjoyed this tonight.  My husband bought a massive cabbage and I've been hunting down ways to use it!  I used a bag of Recipe#31008 and just started from direction #3.  I used 1 tbsp. splenda brown.  We really enjoyed this as a quick and easy way to have cabbage rolls.  We had sliced the cabbage so we sort of stirred it all together and served it over brown rice to taste sort of like the cabbage rolls of my husband's youth.,,
686456,2015,2008-10-08,5,"Excellent and easy!  I used tofu crumbles in place of the beef, added Worcestershire sauce like another reviewer and diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and molasses instead of brown sugar.

200575,2032,2005-03-16,5,This sauce is great! I mixed it up using dried onion flakes instead of fresh onion and doubled the recipe. It was fast and delicious. I used this to make barbecued chicken on the grill. My family loved it.,,
167242,2032,2005-08-23,4,"This turned out pretty good.  The barbeque sauce itself was very nice-- I added a little red pepper for spice, as well as a couple cloves of garlic with the onion, and it was very tangy-sweet and spicy.  The chicken turned out good-- we shredded it up and used it for BBQ sandwiches.  Yum!  Thanks for a very nice sauce recipe!",,
628854,2032,2007-11-04,5,I fixed this for dinner.  I am happy the recipe was GREAT.  I added a little bit of sweet baby rays bbq sauce and I did not put lemon(allergic).  I boiled the chicken first and then pulled it apart and let it simmer in the crock pot all afternoon with your sauce. Thanks for the recipe!!,,
1107633,2032,2009-01-01,5,"This is so good.  I can see where the taste would be a personal preferrence though.  I only used 2 chicken breasts (i made it for myself) and i enjoyed having the extra sauce.  I put salt and pepper on the onions while they were cooking, and added a little cayenne to the sauce.  Also, I did not have lemon juice so I used orange and it came out great.  I took the chicken out at 45 min, shredded it, and coated it with the sauce and put it back in for the remaining 15 minutes.  I will def. make this again!",,

Will definitely be making again! Thanks for posting!",,

489552,2032,2009-10-16,5,Absolutely delicious and so so easy! I loved all the ingredients put together in this recipe.  Once I had my sauce and chicken in the casserole dish I let it sit for about 1/2 hour so that flavor would blend into chicken.  Just PERFECT!  Loved it.  Thank you very much and I will make again.  Made for Aus/NS Tag Game.,,
632249,2032,2009-10-19,5,"I happened upon the review from daisygirl64 just the other day, and thought this recipe sounded good. My family likes their chicken with the skin on, so I kept it on and browned just the chicken in the oven for about 20 minutes, then poured off the grease and continued with your recipe (adjusting the cooking time due to the pre-browning). I also decreased the water to 3/4 C. Everyone loved it, even the kids! I will definitely make this again. Thx for sharing Jan!",,

630926,2032,2009-10-20,5,fairly easy and very tasty!  I omitted the lemon juice because I did not have any.  Also instead of the cup of water I used 1/2 cup of apple juice and 1/2 cup of water and also user cider vinegar!  Thanks for the recipe!,,
1402748,2032,2009-12-06,5,I've been looking for this taste for years. It is fantastic! I used apple cider vinegar and homemade chicken stock instead of water. I also left the skin on and floured & browned the chicken before baking. Served with mashed potatoes and sliced carrots. Mmm mmm good :),,
209613,2032,2010-02-18,5,This recipe worked really well for me. Followed directions exactly except cut back to 3/4 cup water. I used three chicken breasts with skin and bones.

1339655,2032,2010-06-15,2,"We didn't really like this one, sorry.  The sauce was thin like water, I guess I was expecting it to thicken up while baking.  The chicken was juicy, but just plain tasting to me (and I did season the breasts before adding the sauce).  I guess it's just different taste buds!",,
1647634,2032,2010-07-06,5,I made this last night and my family raved about it.  I think they thought I'd spent hours in the kitchen preparing it but actually was one of the easiest things I've ever made.  The oven does the work.  The Ingredients are already in most kitchens and a very tasty dish.  I did add about an 1/8th of a cup more brown sugar to take some of the tangy out but it was great.  I'm going to make the same sauce and try it with brisket this weekend!  Should be really good!,,
560491,2032,2010-09-24,4,"This was good and easy to trhow in the oven.  I made 1/2 the recipe and used b/s thighs.  I also used a shallot rather than the onion.  It was a hit and everyone liked it, especially 19 month DS.  Made for Make My Recipe, Aus/NZ Tag.",,
165933,2032,2012-02-06,5,"DH loved this recipe.  I used the ketchup instead of the tomato sauce and was planning on using chicken stock in place of the 1c water. Well, I forgot to add any water, let alone the stock!  The sauce turned out thick and coated the chicken beautifully.  Thanks for an easy BBQ sauce recipe.",,
286566,2032,2012-10-02,5,"I scaled this back for 2 serves and used 2 Maryland cuts which I disjointed and skinned and  cooked as per recipe at 160C fan forced and they took 45 minutes to cook to perfection, very moist.  The only change I would make in future is to make more of the sauce and definately more onions than the recipe states as I like to serve them over the chicken.  Thank you JustJanS for a very simple and good weekday recipe that is fast and easy to make, made for Please Make My Recipe.",,
1368096,2032,2012-11-13,5,"I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for chicken breast.  Gave this a try and turned out great.  I made a few changes.  I added a clove of garlic with the onions, pinch of salt, pinch of red pepper flakes, used ketchup, and 3/4 cup water.  I also thickened the sauce slightly with a mixture of cornstarch and water.  Would make again.",,
7108,2056,2002-10-10,5,"Yummy!  I did use salted butter, did not use the maple syrup. ",,
68210,2056,2003-02-11,5,"My husband was none to pleased when I announced we were having acorn squash at dinner, but he couldn't shut up about it once he was eating it!  Delicious!  An added bonus was that not only my husband loved it, but also my 2 year old daughter and my 8 month old (he ate some sections withOUT the syrup)!  It's a keeper! :)",,
2148,2056,2003-11-02,5,"This was great!  It tasted like pumpkin pie, when it was finished.  I didn't have any acorn squash, but tried it with a buttercup, and it was marvelous.  ",,
35526,2056,2004-03-11,5,I halved this recipe and it worded very well.  I poked holes in the cavity so the maple/butter flavor could sink in.  Very tasty and simple.  I liked that I did not have to fuss over it.,,
33159,2056,2004-11-20,3,"We normally use butter & brown sugar on our squash so I was excited to find this variation.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the flavours as strong as I thought they should have been.  ",,
4470,2056,2004-12-30,5,"I cut the recipe back to one squash just large enough to serve 2 persons. Easy recipe with great flavor results. Baked them for 40 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered. Used pure Maple syrup, went light on the nutmeg and heavier on the cinnamon.    Thanks Candie for a recipe I will do again.",,
250031,2056,2011-10-03,5,Awesomely easy and delicious! And there's nothing like pure maple syrup. I also used freshly grated nutmeg. Yum!,,
163417,2056,2005-03-13,5,"This was my first time cooking acorn squash, and I wanted simplicity. This recipe fulfilled that criteria! I used one squash, cut in half.

362213,2056,2006-10-25,5,"I used to make my acorn squash with brown sugar--now I'll be making it with maple syrup every time! You don't need the butter, but the cinnamon is a must!",,
77229,2056,2006-11-02,5,Easy to make.  Delicous!  Thanks for posting this recipe.,,
37107,2056,2006-12-27,5,I made this with Marinated Grilled Leg of Lamb Recipe #73842 for Christmas dinner and it was delicious.  I have only ever made squash with brown sugar so I thought this would be a nice change.  I used salted butter and still added a little bit of salt at the table (personal preference). Very nice mild maple syrup flavor.  I also did not have any nutmeg so that was omitted and it wasn't missed.  Will make this again.,,
294000,2056,2007-05-07,4,Very good.  Easy prep.  I halved the recipe and cooked it a little longer as we like the squash pretty soft.  Thank you.,,
377039,2056,2007-10-18,3,"Pretty good. Made just as posted, but added some water to the bottom of the baking dish, and added a dash of freshly ground salt & pepper.  Tasty and not too sweet. I did cook it closer to an hour.",,
219942,2056,2007-10-21,5,"I, too, have always used brown sugar, but no more. We loved the squash with the maple syrup. I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg, (family preference), and added some salt and pepper. Also poked holes with a fork as suggesed by another reviewer. Baked for 1 hour. Everybody wanted more the next night and I didn't have the time, so I microwaved it for about 10 minutes or so, and this also worked in a pinch.Thanks for a great recipe!",,
348803,2056,2007-11-10,4,I've done this with and without water...will add water to the bottom of the dish from now on as it turns out too dry for my liking without. I cut up some pears and added walnuts too. I always cook it one hour and appreciate the heat from the oven on these cold fall days...,,
255179,2056,2008-03-18,5,Yes - this is the only way to make squash now.  No more brown sugar! Thanks so much!  The family ate 'til it was gone and asked for more!,,

789516,2056,2008-07-09,5,"The only thing I wouldn't do next time, is cut a slice off the bottom off the acorn to make them sit flat.  It made the syrup run out all over your plate as soon as you dug in.  These were superb.",,
620763,2056,2008-11-04,5,"This was great.  But I used one acorn squash and cut it in half, much easier than trying to cut an acorn squash into thirds!!!  Not a lot of effort for a great tasting side dish.",,
978517,2056,2008-11-08,5,OH MY! This was excellent. We don't normally eat this kind of thing at my house. But this was AWESOME! Thank you for posting.,,
346874,2056,2008-11-20,5,"SO easy and SO delicious!  We skipped the butter as another reviewer mentioned, and used plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg (a generous pinch of each in each piece of squash).  We also just cut the squash in half (thirds was just too much thinking for me).  This is the kind of thing I love to ""cook""!",,
247241,2056,2008-12-01,5,"I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was gone before I could say ""Happy Thanksgiving"".

I used butternut squash instead of the acorn, but then followed the recipe and the result was a tender, sweet, deliciously flavored squash that I got many compliments from everyone.  We will have this one again!  Thanks!",,
945248,2056,2009-04-14,5,So easy to spoon out of the shell baked this way!  Great squash and one we will have again!  Thanks for sharing!,,

1238623,2056,2009-10-29,5,"We are trying to eat more veggies at our house, so I thought I would give this a try for dinner a couple nights ago.  It was delicious!  My one year old ate half of one squash by himself!",,
469021,2056,2009-12-03,4,"Excellent flavor and very easy to make.  The only issue I had was that it took much, much longer than 45 mins for my squash to be cooked through -- double that, in fact, at the recommended temp.  Still, I didn't mind!  It smelled fantastic while cooking, and all of my guests enjoyed it at Thanksgiving this year.  Thanks for posting!",,
768828,2056,2010-01-17,5,"This was super good - I did use sugar free maple syrup.  It was still really good,  but know this would be much better with pure maple syrup.  Thanks for a great recipe Candie.",,
384133,2056,2010-01-22,5,Awesome and simple recipe. My husband loved it! I made exactly as directed. Will definitely be making this over and over again.,,
361489,2056,2010-09-24,5,this was amazing!  I doubled the recipe and it was delish.  i added a bit more butter to each half of squash and also used fresh maple syrup. I also cooked for about 1 hour at 350 degrees F.  Will make again.,,
1267163,2056,2011-10-12,5,"YUM!  This recipe is phenomenal!  Even my DH, who said he doesn't like squash, was gobbling it up and suggesting we make it for Thanksgiving.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I made it like the directions said, only I halved the squash, scraped it out of the shells when baked, and mashed them all together to mix the flavors evenly.  Mmmm.",,
439685,2056,2012-10-14,3,Tasty,,
211577,2056,2012-11-18,5,"This is very tasty. I cut my squash in half, and baked it for an hour at 400F and it came out perfectly. I also brushed some of the syrup/butter mix from the hollows over the sides of the squash near the end - gave it a nice browned appearance.",,
13796,2056,2014-10-16,5,What a treat!,,
280271,2056,2014-11-10,5,Delicious! Mine took an hour to cook...but this reminded me so much of the recipe my Mom use to make...not sure if she used the syrup or brown sugar...thanks for the memory...=) made for &quot;What&#039;s on the Menu&quot; tag game...,,
527754,2056,2015-10-17,5,"I made this for dinner last night in an effort to get DH to enjoy baked squash. He is not a fan of winter squash.  I cut the squash in half instead of thirds and used I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s not butter light.  I goofed and put 1 tablespoon of maple syrup in each half but it was delicious and perfect that way.  I chose not to add the cinnamon and nutmeg since I mostly wanted the flavor of the squash.  My husband likes a sweet taste but I prefer just butter, salt and pepper on my squash.  This was a simple, tasty solution to please us both since the maple syrup gives a lovely flavor with the butter without all the sweetness of brown sugar.  We both ate an entire half, I call this success!  It took much longer than  45 minutes to bake and I also put a small amount of water in the bottom of the baking dish and did not cut a piece off the bottom, they sat at only a slight angle and were fine.  I took a fork at the end to each half and blended the squash and pool or butter and maple syrup together for the perfect marriage in every bite!  I also added a touch of salt to my half.  This is how I will bake my squash from now on!",,
662636,2057,2007-11-22,5,its good,,
1461592,2057,2009-12-09,5,I was afraid to make these pies because all the ones I've tasted were great and I didnt want to mess it up and I didn't. This recipe is awesome! Thank you for helping me get over my fear!,,

Great with additional ingredients also.",,
45001,2066,2002-07-14,4,"Surprisingly good.  Half the seasoning packet is more than enough. Try using a small (8 inch) nonstick frypan. The ramen & eggs cook up like a pancake, and when done just flip it out on to a plate.",,
41799,2066,2003-10-28,4,"First time I ever tried ramen noodles.  Guess I am behind the times or deprived, LOL.  This was very tasty.  Next time I make it I want to serve it with salsa and sour cream.  I think it would be very yummy that way.  Thanks for sharing Steve.  Tweeky.",,
116970,2066,2003-12-12,4,"This was good stuff!  Not fancy, but good and simple.  I added some soy sauce and a little less of the seasoning packet.  Next time I think I will put some frozen peas in with it.",,
111448,2066,2004-07-29,4,"This is a simple recipe that is very versatile.  This has become one of my lunch time favorites.  When you have four mouths to feed, this is a nice alternative to sandwiches or fast food.",,
214565,2066,2005-06-06,4,"We always use only half the seasoning packet and add soy sauce or terriyaki sauce.  I like greening broccoli and garlic in the butter.  And we cook the egg with the noodles.  Just like egg drop soup, drop the egg in before the noodles (break it with its own shell) and then you don't have to scramble it later.",,

Tonight I did it again for dinner, but with variations.....I added some canned salmon and frozen green peas to the scrambled eggs, used only salt, and totally omitted the seasoning packet.  Both made wonderful, quick, and filling meals.  The quickness and ease of this recipe alone will keep on my ""regular"" meal rotations.",,

222478,2066,2009-09-13,5,"Yum! I often have boiled egg with my noodles but this made a nice change. I used beef flavour because that's all I had and it tasted great, although a lighter color like chicken as recommended would probably look better.",,

222478,2068,2006-03-15,5,"Nice recipe Doreen! I followed the recipe but because I was only making two slices of toast for breakfast just grilled the capsicum under a sandwich press (skin down) and did the toast the same way but made into fingers with the crust intact. I took the photograph before adding the lime, it made a great start to the day! It would also be a good picnic / camping type dish that you could spread just before eating.

9121,2072,2002-01-02,1,"This turned out just awful.  I followed the instructions to a tee, but I think the gelatinous cornstarch mixture did this recipe in!  The texture and taste were off.  I think if I made this again I'd leave the cornstarch mixture out.",,
40777,2072,2002-06-02,5,I have made this recipie twice. I doubled all the ingedients and baked in a 9x9 (8x8) pan. It was awesome. There's no way you could leave out the sauce mix - it's what makes the crunch moist. It was much thicker than a 9X12 pan. I also used 4 cups rhubarb!!! Five Star.  thanks so much for sending this recipie - it is a favorite of all of us. reneh,,
1891,2072,2002-06-21,5,"Everyone in the family loved this... I guess it is a keeper. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 12 by 7 in pan.. Well I think it that size can not see a size on the baking dish.

Thanks for the recipe.",,
34272,2072,2002-11-21,5,This is a wonderful recipe!!  I did increase the amount of white sugar to 1c. and I also made the sauce in the microwave (about 4 min. stiring frequently).  Origanlly I found this recipe in a church cook book & now I found it here as well.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  It is definitely a keeper!:o),,
45833,2072,2003-01-20,5,I have used this recipe for years... using all kinds of fruit. Everyone ALWAYS asks for this recipe!! It is a family favorite!! The only difference is my recipe calls for 1 cup of white sugar in the cornstarch mixture--which is essential IMHO!! Thanks for posting!!,,
39210,2072,2003-06-13,5,Super wonderful! Easy to make. Taste not very sour. A real hit!,,

She's still going strong at 90+ years old and her cookbooks are like dear friends to me.  You can use any combo of fruits.  Last time I combined rhubarb and sour cherries.  Frozen strawberries work well too.  Highly recommended.",,
73904,2072,2004-05-24,5,"This would have been great, if I would have read the reciepe right.
I didn't put half of the crunch on the bottem and then the rest of the top.
Instead I put it all on the bottem.  But then again my hair is blond ha ha

251917,2072,2006-05-08,5,Our neighbor brought us a bunch of fresh rhubarb. We turned right to zaar for a recipe!! My hubby picked this one out and made it for us (Minus the cinnamon). Turned out delicious - very easy to make!,,

I was worried that the rhubarb would be tough but it was just super - much tastier than apple cobbler. 
I used tub type margarine  (not diet) with good results.

726003,2072,2008-06-04,4,"interesting recipe - I had company and was chatting whilst I prepared this, unfortunatley I wasn't concentrating,so I ended up with all the sugar in the crunch and not in the rhubarb!  As a result the crunch was too sweet and the rhubarb was sour.  I will be more careful next time!  I aslo didn't cook it quite long enough - so the rhubarb was a little crunchy!!!  Cooks errors!",,
753978,2072,2008-07-09,5,"I love this! I did however find the sugar content way over the top so I substituted the sugar in the 'crunch' part with 1/4 cup sugar and again took it down to 1/4 cup sugar in the cornstarch mixture and added one apple to the rhubarb to add natural sweetness, it was perfect!

Turns out I was out of vanilla, so I subbed 1/2 t. of almond extract since I was afraid it might overpower.  I was right.  Even the reduced quantity is one of the major flavors.  I'm sure it would be better with vanilla, or is there such a thing as strawberry extract?",,

1142497,2072,2009-07-02,4,"Delicious!  Baked in ungreased glass pan with no sticking.  Will prebake ""crust"" next time to see if I can get more crunch.  Will add 1/2 cup more rhubarb next time for higher fruit to crunch ratio.  Crumb mix is soooooo good - though should be able to cut brown sugar by 1/8 cup without sacrificing taste.  Can't wait to try it with other fillings.  Used 1 tsp honey in place of 1/2 cup sugar in syrup, since a recent review stated it ""Was plenty sweet enough without the added sugar.""  My new garden's rhubarb apparently needs some sweetening, sadly.  Topped with 1/2 cup chopped almonds, sweetened flake cereal, and granola for last 10 minutes of baking to toast, adding more crunch and nutrition.  Will add nuts to bottom layer as well next time.  Overall a delightful treat.  Heading back to the kitchen for some more nibbling, and I'm not even a nibbler.",,
43478,2072,2009-07-14,4,"""Delicious!"", to quote another reviewer.  This was not as sweet as I was expecting based  on other reviews, but the fault may be in my rhubarb.  For me though, this was a good thing.  I often forgo any sort of sweet topping on similar desserts because the sweetness is too much for me.  This particular crumble's tartness is a great pairing for ice, whip & sweetened creams, much to my delight!  Another reviewer also mentioned the fruit to crumble ratio and I concur - next time I will add more fruit.  This was my first foray into the world of rhubarb and it was a success.  Thanks for a terrific recipe Peggy!",,
80937,2072,2009-07-23,5,Best rhubarb recipe yet ! I have 5 rhubarb plants and so far my favorite way to use it is in strawberry rhubarb pie. But after trying this recipe I think there will be less pies in the freezer. I don't think this will be something to mske ahead & freeze but I think using frozen rhubarb in this wouldn't matter. I did use about 6 cups of rhubarb just because I like lots of fruit in my pies/cobblers. Great recipe.,,
945199,2072,2009-08-20,5,Great with ice cream!,,
288451,2072,2009-08-30,5,I made this for a 9 X 13 pan by multiplying the ingredients by 1.5.  This is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.,,
126377,2072,2010-01-19,5,"I'm so glad I found this recipe still here!  Made this a few summers back and was thrilled. I'm more used to having strawberries with my rhubarb so I did a 50/50 and the results were delish! (and a pretty color naturally)  and plenty sweet....no need for more sugar at all- felt guilty enough for having something so sugary sweet as it was! The crunch was just right, wonderful recipe!!",,
670469,2072,2010-04-30,4,"I agree with out reviewers about pre-baking the crust. Mine was both too thick and too mushy.

I added about 6 strawberries to the fruit mix for added color and flavor. I baked it all for an additional 50 minutes. I'm not a big rhubarb fan, but I LOVE this!",,
51224,2072,2010-05-27,5,"Simple, delicious recipe made on request from friends.  I added a bit more cinnamon to counteract the sugar and cooked it for an additional 15 minutes.  (Cinnamon is really good if you have a somewhat high glucose level.) The crumb topping is wonderful with vanilla bean ice cream on top.  My guests were delighted as was my hubby and I.  Thanks for a really good crunch Ed, which I'll be making again!",,
469903,2072,2010-06-21,5,"Would give it more stars if I could!!  We loved this rhubarb dessert, recipe was easy to follow with simple ingredients that I always have on hand. Used some splenda in place of sugar and it set-up just perfectly. Sooo gooood!!",,

1613349,2072,2010-10-02,5,This is my family's favorite rhubarb recipe.  My aunt always added one can of cherry pie filling to the rhubarb mixture and my family prefers it that way.,,
1044093,2072,2010-11-03,5,This is delicious. I used half the recipe to do the crunch but used only 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also used only 1 cup rhubarb since that was all I had. Make a good serving for the two of us. The recipe has the right balance between sweetness and tartness. Will definitely make again thanks for posting.,,
228037,2072,2012-03-26,0,Excellent!   Followed DuChick recommendations.,,

She sent me her recipe and I was going to post it here but this one is so similar, that it will save me the time!

She also suggests that strawberries and peaches are good to mix in or substitute.",,

Didn't pre-bake crust as others suggested. have added a little pineappple or strawbs as others suggested just because I had leftovers, but also made with just rhubarb.

Everyone in my family loved it. They didn't know there is cheese in it. My husband is the type to say ""I knew it tasted funny"". What he doesn't know won't hurt him. I did find that I used a small 8x8 pan, my 9x9 was way too big for the amount of fudge this makes. Thanks Myron this will be on my holiday tray every year from now on.",,

This made for a very thick, hard to work batter and waffle bowls that tasted a lot like eating raw flour and cracked terribly.

This is the 5 Roses Recipe I found on their website: Filling:  2 eggs, 1 cup (250 mL) brown sugar, ½ tsp (2 mL) salt, 1 tbsp (15 mL) cider vinegar, ½ cup (125 mL) maple syrup, ? cup (75 mL) butter, melted, ¾ cup (175 mL) walnut, chopped, ½ cup (125 mL) currants, ½ cup (125 mL) raisins  >http://www.fiveroses.ca/OurRecipes/RecipeDetail/4887?categoryId=234",,

I have her 1958 edition of the Five Roses flour recipe book open in front of me now and the recipe is the same as the one printed except the cookbook says to use 2 tblsp of milk or cream, 1/2 cup of currants (not raisins or nuts) and 1/3 cup butter. My mother always used currants and I do too. There is no maple syrup in the recipe, only brown sugar. Many butter tart recipes use maple syrup and, for some strange reason, vinegar. For me, the old Five Roses recipe is still the most authentic and the best.",,
396347,2126,2007-12-07,5,This is a great old-fashioned German recipe. I make this every year to include on my Christmas cookies plates,,

121985,2129,2004-06-01,5,Yum!  I used a premade graham cracker crust instead of the crust called for in the recipe.  However the pie was still excellent. Thanks!,,
134289,2129,2005-01-27,4,I really liked this pie.  It was a change from the regular key lime pie.  I especially liked the coconut crust.  I love coconut!!,,
42720,2129,2005-06-28,5,"I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!  I love Key Lime Pie better than anything and I've had some very good and some not so good.  This recipe is, by far, the best key lime filling I have ever tasted.  I love how the sour cream mellows the taste of the sweetened condensed milk.  So many recipes just call for the condensed milk, egg yolks and lime juice and to me the condensed milk taste is more predominate over the lime flavor.  Not so with this recipe.  I did leave out the rum this time, but next time I will add it.  The coconut crust was quite tasty also but for those who don't like coconut a regular graham cracker/vanilla wafer crust will work perfectly. Thank you so much for this recipe.  It is the only key lime pie recipe I will ever use from now on.",,
299707,2129,2008-02-22,5,"This pie was delicious.  I made a regular sweet crust pastry as I didn't have any coconut.  I sieved the mixture to smooth it out before pouring into the pie shell.
My family were very pleased!!  I will definitely try the coconut base next time.",,

10033,2137,2002-05-19,5,!!!!!!This was fantastic!!!!!!!! The whole pie was gone in about a day and a half. I love the orange flavor with the rhubarb--I have never had rhubarb before and when I tried it uncooked I was (of course) worried. But this is just amazing. The filling is really to-die-for.,,

195076,2137,2005-03-30,5,"AWESOME and surprisingly easy.  I used vegan butter & it worked great.  I was worried about a pie with only rhubarb (as opposed to strwbry/rhbrb) being bitter, but it wasn't.  The OJ, rind & nutmeg made it smell and taste wonderful!  I loosely covered edges of crust until the end of baking time as they got too brown right away (and it kept bubbly filling from spilling over/out of pretty lattice top crust.)",,
69474,2137,2005-05-12,5,This is the only rhubarb pie I will ever use!!!  awesome..usually I have to throw out or freeze portions...hated to see it end..begging for more rhubarb already...I used instant clear jel instead of cornstarch..and slightly more grated orange peel...thanks so much...can't say enough...wish I know how to submit a picture...I am going to try your technique with lemons and apples...can't wait...,,

283787,2137,2006-06-18,5,My husband and son loved it.  We did add Strawberries to ours.  I am certain it still is very delicious without strawberries.  We also used  pre-made pie crusts so our preparation time was greatly reduced. I will make this one again.,,
254415,2137,2006-07-03,5,Rated this recipe 5 stars for ease of preparation and taste. I used cherry juice and 1/4 tsp red food coloring for a sparkling red pie that is picture perfect. The scarlet juice bubbled up through the lattice crust; beautiful . Did an egg wash and sprinkled with sugar.,,
74987,2137,2006-07-09,5,"Loved this pie. My favorite rhubarb pie is Strwbry/rhbrb but this was a wonderful change. Took it to a gathering and got rave reviews on it, infact one guest prefered it better then the regular one.

My MIL had once said that it was her favorite type of pie, but she hadn't had it in almost 30 years b/c my FIN hates it. I decided to make it as directed with the following exceptions: I added a can of seedless rasberry pie filling and used 3/4 c. sugar. The result was incredible. Even my FIN liked it (or at least ate a huge piece to be kind) whatever. I tried something new and it made my MIL's day!",,
235662,2137,2007-07-29,5,This pie was perfectly delicious; not too sweet. The orange really compliments the rhubarb. I can't wait to make it again!,,

I've made it several times in the last few weeks and used precooked (dry) tapioca, 1/4 cup per pie -just stir it into the chopped rhubarb in a bowl along with the sugar, oj, zest, and nutmeg.  No precooking needed. Let it stand in the bowl for about 15 minutes and then put it into the pie shell, add a top, and bake as directed.

557764,2137,2008-05-24,4,"Thank you YUM!  The only thing different I did was not to lattice the top.  Instead I cut a few decorative holes on the top, egg washed that and then liberally sprinkled sugar, for that old fashion look.",,
64322,2137,2008-06-29,5,"My husband went right out to water the rhubarb so it would grow so I can make another pie!!  We thought the orange really set it off.  I can't say I measured everything exactly, just used whatever juice I got out of the orange and all the rhubarb I got this morning.  Very Good, indeed!",,

I've never made one so of course I went straight to the cookbooks, with no luck, all they had were strawberry and rhubarb. Don't know why I didn't try here first. My Mom loved it and I'm making another for her tonight to use up the rest of the rhubarb. I used Minute Tapioca instead of corn starch which you don't have to heat, just let it sit for 15 minutes. Many thanks from my Mom and from me-She said it made her feel like she was young again (she'll be 88 tomorrow). Thank You for a keeper. Jan",,
406503,2137,2009-04-09,5,Have made this pie a number of times and follow the recipe to the letter. Family and friends have all enjoyed the pie and usually get requests for seconds.

1300836,2137,2009-06-19,5,"This is a fantastic recipe!  I think that it's a little more ""citrusy"" than a typical rhubarb pie, but still ... it has a great taste.  I served this to my family and they said I should make this commcercially.  I think it's a winner!",,
1306315,2137,2009-06-25,0,I followed the measurements very carefully and the pie turned out  sloppy.  Maybe skipping the orange juice would do it.,,
17803,2137,2009-07-15,5,"A very good recipe but like cookinthewoods, ours did not set up either.  So the second one we made we used a total of 4 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch.  Perfect, it set up nicely.  We also egg washed the lattice top and sprinkled it with turbinado sugar.  I love this sugar as it adds a nice crunch to your baked goods.

I actually made two pies--one, strawberry-rhubarb (added about 1-1/2 cups fresh sliced strawberries to basic recipe and decreased rhubarb by about 1 cup) and I made a rhubarb pie for the purists in my family...High praise for both and this recipe is definitely going in my keeper file.  Thank you!",,
439400,2137,2013-09-23,5,"Great pie.  Made it with just 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet for me.  I was afraid it would be too runny after pouring the mixture into the crust, but it set up nicely after cooling.  I baked it for closer to an hour.",,

28346,2144,2004-10-15,4,"Tasty and fairly simple to mix up although a bit too sweet for me.  I did cut down a little on the sugar, and even made one with Splenda which worked fine.  Also you can mix this up, get it into the pan and refrigerate and bake the next day with good results.  Went over well at a recent party.",,
142559,2144,2006-08-11,4,"YUM!! I omitted the chili peppers and parsely, out of preference, and it was very good! Topped it with a little FF sour cream and some salsa.  Will make again!! Thanks!",,

242729,2155,2008-08-10,4,"Firstly, if you think these are cakes as most people know them, they are not! They are more like shortcakes, shortbreads, British biscuits or American cookies........slightly soft in the centre and crispy on the outside. The dough is easy to make and roll out - I used small sized scone cutters to cut mine out. There was no salt in the recipe and I thought that might be why some reviews said they tasted ""doughy"", so I added 1/4 teaspoon of ""low salt"" to enhance the flavour. I halved the recipe to make 10 biscuits and used 2 teaspoons of ground ginger and a pinch of cayenne pepper. They were subtle and quite spicy, not as spicy as I thought they might have been - I may add more ginger next time or use freshly grated ginger root. They took about 20 minutes to bake on the middle shelf at 180C. We enjoyed these with a cup of tea today. I am glad I tried these out - I suspect they may even need to be harder, more like a spicy rusk - pleasant biscuits that were not too sweet. Thanks for posting! FT:-)",,

I usually make it the traditional way with a candy thermometer and this was much easier.  While it did set for me, it was much more soft set than I am used to, almost truffle like in firmness.

215956,2218,2008-06-30,4,This was good.  Not overly sweet - the only change I made was to use skim milk instead of buttermilk - I didn't have any buttermilk.  I also had to make adjustments for high altitude - I only used 1/2 tsp soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder - I increased the milk by 2 Tbsp as well.  I put about 1 cup pecans into the cake.  I didn't make the topping - just as well - I noticed the directions didn't mention the topping at all.  Served warm with FF Cool Whip.  DH liked it!  Thanks.,,

I noticed a lot of people complained about them being too sweet.  So after comparing similar recipes, I decided to cut down the sugar to a little less than 1.25 cups which gave it the perfect sweetness.  I used Skippy natural peanut butter and a little more than a cup of Hershey's milk chocolate chips.

The only problem I had was the peanut butter filling got stuck to the bottom of the pan making it difficult to scoop out the bars without mangling them.  Next time, I will use cupcake wrappers to eliminate this problem and make them more like actual peanut butter cups.",,

I have made these lovely darlings several times for groups large and small. They are usually the first to disappear, and fans invariably ask for the recipe. It's the texture produced by the graham cracker crumbs that really gives the mouth-feel of a Reese's Cup. Of course, the flavor is fabulous! They are extremely rich, so are best cut in small pieces. The chocolate topping does tend to crack if it is chilled too long (I've made the mistake of chilling overnight before cutting) so Tonkcats' 2 hour chill time is a good guideline to follow. Excellent contribution Tonkcats - thanks!!",,

This time I added 1 full cup of PB and melted about 1 1/2 cupds chocolate chips in about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream.

I made some slight variation as follows: First I made the peanut butter mixture, formed into eggs and froze till firm- then I quickly coated with chocolate. For the chocolate, I used 1 1/4 cup chips + 2 teaspoons of Crisco in order to form a smooth, glossy coating for my eggs. I then let the coated eggs cool overnight. Note, about 10 graham cracker squares (or about 5 whole crackers) equal 1 cup of crumbs. This one is worthy of an Easter Basket- Very rich, but oh so yummy!",,

I had to pry the chocolate off, melt more butter and add it to the bottom mixture, remixed it up and re-pressed it back into the dish, I scraped the dry bits off the back of the chocolate I pried off, remelted it and re-spread it.

I did mine a little different. I melted the chocolate chips and spread on the bottom and sides of a pie tin...(freeze) then spread on the peanut buttery goodness and then melted another round of chocolate chips and spread.  A giant peanut butter cup!

947010,2267,2008-09-06,5,Excellent! I took smltheppl's advice and decreased the amount of powdered sugar... I used 1 1/3 cups and the result was fabulous! I also would recommend unsalted butter. Way to go Tonkcats!!!,,

I used 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 cup creamy PB and cut the butter down to 1/4 cup. For the chocolate I used a blend of Ghiradelli candy coating and Callebaut milk chocolate.

To make PB cups-
1)) spoon a line of PB mix onto sheets of wax paper and roll into a skinny uniform log, about 3/4 inches in diameter and freeze.  
2)) Meanwhile line a mini muffin tin with  #4 or #5 size brown candy cups. Pipe or spoon just enough chocolate to cover the bottoms, then shake the pan  a little to smooth out evenly.  
3)) Chill chocolate pan for 10 minutes in the fridge or until hard.
4)) Cut 1/2 inch slices from PB log, place on top of hardened chocolate in candy cups, then fill the rest of candy cup with melted chocolate.  Shake pan a little to even out chocolate and chill.",,
894666,2267,2009-03-05,5,"Satisfies the sweet tooth, you only need a few bites unlike some desserts where you just keep wanting more.

1328942,2267,2009-08-31,5,"I make these all the time. I have found that it's best to use JIF peanut butter instead of the natural kind because it's stiffer/thicker. It's also better to use chocolate graham crackers. I find that using those two are important in making it tastes much like Reeses but also the texture holds up better. If anyone is having issues with their chocolate being too 'chocolately' simply melt a TB of peanut butter with it. Also, its fun to get creative with these. I've tried them in various shapes and sizes. One of my favorite, super easy treats!",,
136511,2267,2009-09-24,4,"I made these for dessert the other day. I personally don't like chocolate and pb together, so I didn't taste them.  My mom said they were delectable though and DH's friend said they tasted just like a Reese's PB Cup.  They were pretty easy to make, the only complaint I have, and the reason for only 4 stars, was that they were so hard to cut.  I was only able to salvage a few because when I tried to cut them the chocolate ""shattered"".  I'm not sure how to cure that.  Next time I make these I might try to put them in mini muffin cups to avoid the broken chocolate.  Thanks for posting!",,

But they do taste like the real thing, only maybe a little sweeter.",,
1800266019,2267,2017-04-15,5,"This is the best recipe yet for these type of no bake peanut butter treats. Let me tell you that they are made even more scrumptious by using ? cup crushed pretzels and ? cup graham crackers. The salt that the pretzel offers is unrecognizable as salty but greatly intensifies the peanut butter flavor of these delicious treats. The pretzels for lack of a more creative or better word make the recipe taste so much more &quot;peanut buttery&quot; rather than just super sweet with an identifiable peanut butter taste. Also the texture is markedly improved by using pretzels making still a sticky but somehow also flakey product . Note - just adding salt to the recipe does not create the same flavor and texture as the actually addition of pretzel. Also FYI I wanted to make knock off PB eggs for Easter or at the very least a tray of &quot;truffles&quot;. I have been unable to shape or form any similar recipe for peanut butter cups until I found this one- and they taste and look great - BUT I did find that there is a method. First I used a combo of 2/3 cup salted pretzels crumbs and 1/3 cup graham crackers-added all the dry together first and mixed well. Then I mixed in the peanut butter first with a spoonula then with clean hands- I added the melted butter last incorporated with my hands. I was left with the perfect texture to create egg shapes, truffles, or press into molds. Fantastic !!",,
2001362355,2267,2018-03-21,5,"This was fairly easy to make, although I had trouble getting my chocolate chips to get to the right consistency to spread easily which then made it more difficult to cut.

They had a very tender texture similar to a cake doughnut on the inside and the outside texture resembled a biscuit.  I brushed them with butter and dusted them with powdered sugar.  I added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon to the dough (just to experiment further).  I think the next time, I may add a little grated lemon rind and omit the cinnamon.",,

If you want ring doughnuts without special pans or deep-frying, this is probably as good as you'll get, and is a very tasty recipe in its own right.  They're crusty when first baked, but I gave them a thin glaze and kept them in a tupperware and they've softened now.",,

I wanted to use up some fresh berries and was unsure of how many to use so used about 2 1/4 cups halved berries, probably could have used a bit more.

27385,2364,2002-02-06,5,this was really good. i added garlic as i do with every recipe and soaked the chicken in buttermilk over nite as it tenderizes the chicken(just rinse it off before cooking). very tasty and quite easy!! try this you'll like it!!!  polly,,
6258,2364,2002-11-26,5,"We thought this was a very tasty dish.  I took Polly's hint and soaked them in buttermilk, but didn't rinse them.  The chicken was moist, and the feta and spinach flavors were wonderful.  Thanks for posting a good tasting, easy recipe.",,

350712,2364,2007-09-20,5,this recipe was great and easy.  i added some italian spices and poultry seasoning and chilli powder to give it a lil kick.  i loved it and so did my husband.,,
185285,2364,2007-11-08,5,"Great, simple and elegant dish.  Because there are only a few ingredients, make sure you use a good quality feta!!  I used fresh arugula rather than spinach because it is what I had on hand.. and opted to add just a pinch of onion.  Mine took 25 minutes (I used a meat probe) to reach a safe temp to eat, but I was using the convection bake setting on my oven.  I served these over pasta with Recipe #58246 and Recipe #92175 for a complete meal.",,
639708,2364,2007-11-11,4,A little bit too bland even though I added garlic and italian seasonings.  I think next time I may add light cream cheese for a more rich taste.,,

157167,2364,2008-01-29,5,My breasts were too thin so I topped them instead of filling them.  It was delicious!,,

233920,2364,2008-03-23,5,"This is the best chicken breast dish I have ever made! Absolutely delicious! The lemon juice takes this dish from good to great. I even added a little extra. I also added some garlic powder, coriander, and paprika to the outside of the chicken. I fried them a bit for some browning before baking. I was a little confused about the directions to ""broil for 15 mins"" after it said to preheat oven to 350, so I just baked it at 350 for 25 mins. Wonderful! Thanks tranch!",,
586286,2364,2008-03-27,5,Family really like this. I have cooked it often.,,
628696,2364,2008-05-13,4,Super easy recipe and tasty. The only thing I did differently was add a bit of fresh garlic to the spinach. And it seemed to take a lot longer to broil than 15 minutes. I put the baking rack on the highest position and it still took almost 45 minutes. And the chicken never browned. I'm not sure what went wrong there. Maybe the temperature was too low? I'm surprised I'm the only person who seemed to have this issue :(,,
947293,2364,2009-01-19,4,"This was exceptional!

I was a little bit confused by the instructions to preheat the oven to 350, then later saying to ""broil"".  Maybe that's exactly what the posting chef meant, but the instructions just seemed odd to me.  I chose to bake the breasts at 375 for about 30-35 minutes.  I used a thermometer to test for 165 degrees.

I also used fresh spinach for the stuffing.  First I steamed it lightly in a pot with chopped onion and minced garlic and salt.  Just as I was taking it off the heat I stirred the feta in, then proceeded to stuff each chicken breast a few moments later.

Didn't bother with trying to cut pockets in the breasts.  I pounded the breasts out thinner and then simply folded them over and toothpicked them over the stuffing I'd inserted in the fold.

Flavors paired particularly well with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette.",,
461889,2364,2009-09-23,3,"This was pretty good.  I added some homemade sun dried tomatoes which helped the taste.  Still felt it needed something...  chicken got a little dry on me.  Overall, it still was well received by the family.  Hey if my husband eats spinach..... enough said!",,
1269490,2364,2009-10-04,5,"I love the idea of this recipe, just changed it a little.  I placed bacon on the board then added the chicken breast, put the spinach and feta in the middle and then rolled it all up.  The bacon keeps the chicken moist and adds a great combination of texture and flavour and you don't have to use the toothpick as the bacon holds it together well!!  I cooked this all summer at the conference center I work at. One week for 300 people!! Everyone loves it!  Thanks for sharing.",,
480970,2364,2009-10-04,5,"This was excellent!  I did make a couple of changes however.  I stuffed the breasts with feta and spinach and placed in a single layer in a dish.  I squeezed the juice from half of a lemon on top of the chicken.  I put the chicken into the fridge to marinate in the juices for an hour or so.  I then ground fresh salt and pepper on top of the chicken, put the Olive Oil in a large skillet and got the pan and oil really hot.  I then cooked the chicken in the skillet until it was completely done.  The caramalization on the chicken was awesome.  Thank you for a quick and easy dinner!",,
185142,2364,2010-01-10,5,"I was thoroughtly confused at the 'preheat of to 350' and the 'broil' instructions, so I just browned the chicken on top of the stove in a hot pan with a little olive oil. It was absolutely delicious!",,
1052065,2364,2010-02-01,5,"Yum. I made this with fresh spinach leaves and fat free feta and it was fabulous. I cooked it @ 350Â° but it took close to an hour. It was well worth the wait though. Also, I marinated it about 4 hrs. Perfect.
Thanks for sharing Tranch!!",,
55406,2364,2010-02-10,5,"This recipe needs a little clarification as others have noted. I took the suggestion to bake at 375, it only took about 25 minutes in my oven and was done. I then broiled for about five minutes, but don't feel that was truly necessary. The flavors are great together, we just have to get the baking/broiling time tweaked! I cut mine into medallions and served with stir fry garlic sliced baby portabello mushrooms, a side salad with vinagrette, and a nice red wine! I used fresh baby spinach leaves and also the crumbled feta cheese which had roasted red peppers in it, which comes in a package in the deli section. Was excellent for an early Valentines Day meal. For presentation, I think would be nicely served in medallion style over a spinach bed, maybe creamed spinach. Nonetheless, it tastes great! Thanks for the recipe, Tranch.",,
456807,2364,2010-07-15,4,"I really loved this recipe. I've never made stuffed chicken before and I'll totally be making this again. I followed some of the other reviews advice and marinated the chicken in buttermilk overnight.I also added some Parmesan cheese and a clove of fresh garlic (minced) to the spinach/feta mixture. The only person who didn't like this was my extremely picky (doesn't like anything green) brother. Everyone else gobbled it up. I'm only giving it four starts because I'm not so sure it would have been as good without the garlic. Anyway, great recipe!",,
659599,2364,2014-01-14,4,"It was tasty and light.  I used fresh spinach and added read, orange, and yellow peppers for color.",,
30220,2366,2002-05-18,4,"This is a very nice soup, and doesn't take long to make....about 50 minutes from begining to end, because of preparing the ingredients.  I did not have the banana pepper or the red pepper flakes, so I used Tobasco sauce....just a bit, because I don't like too much heat.  The next time I make it though...I think I will double the recipe, because it tastes even better the next day!  I also used about twice the amount of caraway seed.  It is what really makes this soup, I think. I also used a potato masher to mash up some of the ingredients before serving.

57758,2366,2002-10-15,4,"Wonderful.  Based on what I had in my cupboards I subsituted skim milk for evaporated,a chopped jalapeno for the bannana pepper, and used only grated old cheddar cheese.  I also added extra spices (especially the caraway). Great for a week night dinner or for company.",,

417267,2366,2008-10-09,4,"Made the soup, doubling everything since I had two small heads cauliflower, and gave hubby the obtion of creamed or not. He chose not and added shredded chedder to the bowl instead of to the soup. Was very tasty. Think I'll cream the leftovers and serve over chicken breasts.",,
311625,2366,2008-10-21,4,"This was definitely good. Didn't have the wow I was looking for but maybe that's because I didn't have the caraway. Next time I will puree some of the veggies like the other reviewers suggested to give a creamier texture. Used soy milk in place of evaporated and a vegan cheese spread in place of cheddar. Kids inhaled it though, and it was a very filling meal so I will make it again.",,

We thought it tasted very good, just too rich for more than a bite at a time. I joked it was definitely ""Death by Chocolate"" with the combo of the cake and chocolate buttercream icing. The second thing I would have changed, also related to the icing - the cake did not hold up to a thick buttercream (was planning to pipe some decorations but used all the icing just trying to ""glue"" the crumbling cake back together!). When I make this again, I will use a ""lighter"" icing or glaze that won't destroy the cake or create an overwhelmingingly rich dessert.",,

327938,2496,2007-06-22,5,"This is delicious! Instead of making a cake, I made the recipe into cupcakes (made 20) and baked about 30-35 minutes. The results were amazing! I used the cupcakes as part of Baby Pacifiers (shower favors - #112525) and brought them in for a baby shower at work today. The girls all raved about them. They had no idea how easy this was to make ;) Thanks for sharing... your recipes never disappoint!",,
497152,2496,2007-06-28,5,"This was a fabulous, rich chocolate cake. Kids and hubby raved about it. I had a killer chocolate craving last night, and it all ended with that first bite. Delish, delish, that's all I can say.",,
410727,2496,2007-07-02,4,"Sneaking a taste of this right out of the oven, I was rather unimpressed. However, after being frosted and put in the fridge overnight, it was very moist and yummy. I most likely would make this again.",,
239028,2496,2007-07-03,5,"I loved this recipe! Moist and delicious. I might cut back the baking soda back to just 1 teaspoon next time around as I can taste a hint of it in the finished cake although no one else has said anything about it. So, it's 5 stars from this family!",,
387367,2496,2007-07-08,5,"Loved this! It took less than fifteen minutes from taking out the bowl to putting in the oven. So easy and fool proof!!! I halved the recipe and baked it in one round 8"" pan. Dusted it with icing sugar and served with hot custard. Delicious. Will definately make this again! Thanx for a great recipe Marg!!",,
230017,2496,2007-07-13,5,I made this cake for my son's birthday and I must say it was the best cake I have had in long time!  I will never use a box mix again for this cake had more flavor than any mix I have ever made.,,
245871,2496,2007-07-14,5,"Super recipe! I used this with icing recipe 89207 and it was a huge hit with all of my family! The cake was moist and delicious and the icing added that little bit to push it over the edge into ""chocolate decadence"" using only ingredients I already had in my pantry!",,
322707,2496,2007-07-16,5,"This has become my chocolate cake recipe. I have made this cake about six times so far. Just love it. I use green and blacks cocoa-so I sort of think its kind of healthy. Also, I cut the sugar in half. Still taste great.",,
253476,2496,2007-07-22,2,"Everyone else loves this recipe so much that I hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but I was really disappointed by this cake. To me, it had the same taste and texture as a box mix (maybe because of the oil? I don't know...), and I thought it needed a lot more chocolate flavor. (FYI, I used the full 1 cup of boiling water, and I actually thought it could have been more moist, although maybe I overbaked it?) If I made it again, I might try swapping out the oil for applesauce and adding in some melted baking chocolate.",,
494607,2496,2007-07-28,5,"This was great. Very moist. Update: I made this again and had several friends request the recipe. When I made this the first time, I thought I made it wrong because the batter was very thin, but it bake up great.",,

But the rest of my family liked it",,

i like the top to be a little moist =)",,
462636,2496,2007-08-09,5,Really moist and yummy! It wasn't too sugary like a lot of other chocolate cakes I've tried. I only used 1/2 cup cocoa cause my family doesn't like stuff too decadent.,,
140132,2496,2007-08-15,5,What a moist cake.  I've never been a big fan of chocolate cake as I've always thought they were dry and crumbly.  Not so. This is a delicious recipe....thank you for opening my eyes to chocolate cake....mmmmmmm.  This is a winner in my books since its so simple and basic ingredients.....thank you.....Stephanie,,
522177,2496,2007-08-17,5,"Moist, Moist, moist! I only used 1/2 a cup of boiling water because I wanted to make a black forest cake out of it. Is sooo delicious!",,
521129,2496,2007-08-21,5,"This is a beautiful chocolate cake! It really is super moist, definitely the best consistency of any cake I have ever baked. I don't get many good cake mixes here in the Czech Republic so I will be using this a lot. Even my BF who has a thing against cakes loved it. The cake I ended up with was pretty huge for the two of us, but now our friends love us lots and lots!",,

581179,2496,2007-09-06,5,"This was definitely the easiest chocolate cake I've ever made. At first the boiling water sounded peculiar, but it is the ingredient that makes this recipe special. I frosted the cake, but after tasting it I knew it wasn't necessary. I warmly recommend.",,
174740,2496,2007-09-09,5,"Excellent cake! Everybody loved it! I used vanilla buttercream icing and it was sooo good! Next time I'd like to try chocolate icing. The directions were very clear and this was very easy to prepare. And I got to brag that I made a ""homemade cake"" LOL! Thanks!",,
190688,2496,2007-09-11,5,"For the life of me I can't figure out what I am doing wrong with this cake! I have made it 4 times now and I give up. The first time I made it it was wonderful. Light, fluffy, everyone loved it. So, I thought, I should make this again!! Well, the second through 4th times I tried the recipe it was disaster. I have read and re-read the recipe to make sure I am doing everything correct and can not figure out what i am doing wrong. The cake is fallen, heavy and tastes terrible. I gave up trying to get the cake to cook through after 8o minutes. This one goes in my disaster file. If anyone knows what i am doing wrong let me know, because when this cake comes out right it is terrific, but when it dosen't it is TERRIBLE.
Well, I decided to give it one more try, cause I hate to admit defeat, donchaknow. This time Yipee! Success! As the first time I made the cake, it was terrific, we all enjoyed it a ton. So, I a revising my rating and giving the cake 5 stars.
What went wrong? I have no idea, but the last two times I have done this now it has turned out fine. Same everything...different result.",,
176615,2496,2007-09-12,5,Delicious! Made this for DH's birthday along with recipe#89207 as Marg suggested. I live in a very humid area so took Marg's advice and used 2/3 cup water. Mine did fall slightly as it cooled but was still quite moist without being heavy or thick. Thanks for sharing the recipe!,,
591205,2496,2007-09-18,4,loved this recipe...tried it out for hubby's bday....was AWESOME to say the least.. i stuck to d suggestion of reducing the sugar to one&a half cups...made a mild coffee cream frosting...used two round baking pans...best bit is d cake remains really moist even after a day in d fridge :-),,
330805,2496,2007-09-27,5,Absolutely delicious ! ! ! I am a keen baker but since migrating to Australia my much loved recipe taste/texture has not performed the same. I made this recipe for the first time for my hubby's birthday and everyone loved it.  Thank you for this deliciously moist recipe.,,
332281,2496,2007-10-02,5,I have made this cake twice and it never stays around for long. This is the best chocolate cake that I have ever made. It was so rich and moist! I used 2 round cake pans and I used the full 1 cup of boiling water. Thank you so much for this recipe!,,
402559,2496,2007-10-07,5,"Yummy! Used 1/2 cup butter instead of the oil, egg substitute for the eggs and the full cup of boiling water. Light, fluffy, moist and chocolaty. Will make again, thanks!",,

579335,2496,2007-10-14,5,"Wonderful ""from scratch"" cake.  I used 2 tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a little less than 1 cup of hot freshly brewed coffee in place of the water.  You don't taste the coffee in the cake, it just makes it extra moist.  I also left the eggs at room temperature and seperated the whites before adding them.  I added the yolks but whisked the whites a bit, with a pinch of sugar until they were bubbly. (I heard it makes the cake light and airy)  It was fabulous.  The batter was thin, but baked up nicely.  I topped it with peanut butter icing.  1 cup peanut butter, 3/4 stick butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 4 Tbsp milk.  Perfect!",,
614296,2496,2007-10-15,5,"FABULOUS!! I been told I cook very well but when it comes to baking I have a horrible mental issue with it. I feel very intimidated by all baking recipes even boxed recipes. This is the first time I have ever made anything homemade without a disaster. Great tasting cake. Thanks for building my confidence for baking. Now if I can only master a homemade pie... (just a suggestion - you should add to the recipe that if cooking with a 9"" x 13"" glass pyrex dish the temp should be 325 degrees)",,
358015,2496,2007-10-16,5,"This was perfect! Created it for an 'Apple Laptop' cake for the first time! I now use it for any time I want chocolate cake.

Really improves in the flavour!! Thanks for posting!",,

193912,2496,2007-10-21,4,"erm...it didn't stay risen...maybe oven too hot or something? But it made a lovely chocolate brownie, which I topped with a slab of chocolate melted with some dounble cream...mmmmm yum!",,
146310,2496,2007-11-03,5,"So simple yet so good. If I could give this 10 stars I would. It has that perfect moistness that box mixes seem to have.

533408,2496,2007-12-24,5,"Unbelievable chocolate cake-- I made this for a Winter Solstice gathering of 20 people and nearly every single person raved with comments like ""I find excuses to go into the kitchen to eat your chocolate cake,"" and almost everyone said it was the best chocolate cake they had ever eaten.  I am gluten intolerant, so I substituted Whole Foods's gluten-free baking flour and it was still perfect.",,
345731,2496,2007-12-27,5,I made this for my son's birthday using Kingsmill egg sub in place of the eggs (allergy) and it turned out perfectly. Besides tasting great it didn't stick to my pan at all. (I followed an eggless cake recipe last year and it stuck to everything.) Thanks for the recipe!,,
456914,2496,2008-01-08,5,"I found this cake tasted better the second day after making it.  Don't know why, but it was awesome!!  If I had rated it by that first piece only I probably would have given it 3 - 3 1/2 stars.  That's how much better it was after sitting.
I iced it with the Chocolate Buttercream frosting recipe that was reccommended.  Next time I am going to try it with a Ganache icing just for a different taste.  Thanks for this recipe I will definitely make it again - my kids loved it too!",,
672478,2496,2008-01-12,5,"I made this cake and love it , except I added four eggs instead of two..next time, I'll try it with just two eggs and see if I prefer it that way.  I actually found the recipe in my Hershey's chocolate cooking book :). Delicious!  I also made it with the frosting that was listed in the book and in the back my cocoa can.  It can also be found here: Recipe #89207.    This cake is moist and delicious! I liked it better then cake in a box. :) Awesome!!",,
720065,2496,2008-01-12,5,"I'm usually quite sceptical about five star ratings but this recipe does indeed deserve it.  And I haven't spotted lower ratings with accompanying sour comments, not that I've read through all 139 ratings.

A chocolate cake for a 9 by 13 pan was needed and, rather than convert the quantities and timings from my favourite recipe, I suggested this one, which is similar - along with the usual admonition that, as it's a US recipe, reducing the sugar might be a smart move.  

The 5 and 6 year olds demolished it in minutes. 

Just one suggestion.  If you have any treacle, try beating in one tablespoon as you near the end of stage 4 in the recipe.  Note for US cooks: It really needs to be treacle. Molasses is not the same ingredient as treacle, nor is golden syrup!  However, this recipe is so good, it's not begging for anything else.",,

714655,2496,2008-01-24,5,"Damned fine cake, Marg!  I used 1/2 coffee and 1/2 water, but other than that, stuck to recipe as written.

I only used 1 3/4 cup of the sugar, but used the entire cup of boiling water.  It was perfect.  I also added a cup of chocolate chips, although it would have been just as good without.  This is a super moist cake, that I will make often.  I paired it with chocolate sour cream frosting, also from this site, and it was a winning combination.  This frosting is not a sickening sweet one. It was just perfect with this cake.  If you are a chocolate love, this is a must try cake!!",,

It wasn't too rich, but it was just right. I also frosted it with Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting which was delicious. The only problem I had was with the cake falling in the middle. I used two 9"" cake pans, so next time I will just do cupcakes or a use a rectangular pan. Overall this was an awesome and easy cake to make! Thanks!",,

Even my hubby whose not a huge chocolate cake fan came back for seconds,,
41370,2496,2008-02-25,5,I made this cake one morning needing a chocolate fix.  The ingredients were all stock items so it was a very simple recipe to follow.  I baked two 9 inch cakes for 50 minutes in a conventional oven.  They cooled quickly and were very easy to frost.  The cake was very moist and not too sweet.  I am looking forward to having a piece tomorrow (if there is any left over once my Hubby comes home!).  Just kidding.  The portion is huge!  This can easily be used for a family gathering and everyone will enjoy.  Thanks so much for the post.  :),,

779859,2496,2008-03-02,2,Not so impressed. Maybe I didnt add enough sugar (seemed like a lot) but either way it didnt task much like chocolate. Maybe icing will help but I think I might just start again with a new recipe.,,

I followed the instructions exactly except at the end I added 1 bag of chocolate chips to add texture to the cake.  After it cooled, I used chocolate mousse in  between the layers and buttercream frosting for the outside.  When we cut into the cake, though, it seemed to crumble pretty easily, although that could be my fault with the mousse.  Next time I try it, I'll be using a chocolate ganache and most likely leaving the chocolate chips out since the cake was flavorful enough and didn't need the extra chocolate.  Overall though, my co-workers thoroughly enjoyed the cake and they've requested it several times, so this is definitely a winner!  Thanks for such a great recipe!",,

It was very easy and although were lots of warnings about the thinness of the batter, I was still surprised and nervous (I used 3.4 cup boiling water) about just how thin the batter is.

I will be making this cake for many occasions, thanks sooo much for sharing this quick and simple recipe!

Addition: I made this a second time and replaced the boiling water with boiling strong-brewed coffee and man, it turned out twice as good as the first time around! This time I glazed it with Recipe #89594 using semi-sweet chocolate. Amazing, simple, and tasty!",,
773782,2496,2008-03-28,5,"This was very tasty cake! I was a bit worried when I added the water because the batter was quite thin. However, I poured it into the tins and it turned out fine. I did use 8"" tins despite the warnings and they didn't overflow (but almost!). I had issues getting one layer out of the tin but that was my fault and not the recipe's. This was very good!",,
503916,2496,2008-03-29,5,"yummy! thanks for a lovely birthday cake for my friend. used 3/4 cup boiling water, and it was lovely, moist and chocolate-y. =)",,
705794,2496,2008-03-31,5,"Really enjoyed the choc cake. and also the baking experience. I use 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 out of preference. and I like it that way. to avoid any sticking on the 13x9, i lined up parchments which get rid of the fuss of sticking batter, and baked for 45 minutes. i added in 2 tbsp of Milo which turns out to be great. The batter was thin after the hot water was added up. if you're scared for the batter to be too thin, then use 3/4 boiling water. beat it, and toss it in the oven. don't think about it. it will turn out great at the end.",,
528049,2496,2008-04-04,4,"it was good, very moist and soft. i replaced the eggs with 1/2 cup of applesauce and it was still pretty good.",,
226066,2496,2008-04-27,5,"One word - WOW!!  First off, I loved the ease of preparation of this cake!  Took me minutes to prepare!  Made this for my nephew's baptism and it was a hit!!  Used Marg's recipe #95416 for the icing.  Thanks Marg! :)",,
199657,2496,2008-04-28,5,"This worked great for cupcakes.  It made 24, the second 12 cupcake batch came out fine in spite of the batter sitting for about 20 minutes (the leavening still worked).  I frosted it with some ganache and got rave reviews.  Thanks for a keeper!",,
828068,2496,2008-04-28,5,"Usually I find cake made from scratch dry, however, this recipe is fantastic.  It's very moist and simple to make.  All I had was the Hershey's coco as the time, but it turned out just fine.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe. Love it.",,
792130,2496,2008-05-05,0,"I made a three layer version of this recipe yesterday and it was delicious!  
If you want the cake to turn out moist, be sure not to overcook the cake by even a split second.  I used the buttercream recipe #261024 and it was delish!  
This would also work very well as a cherries jubilee cake.",,
323832,2496,2008-05-13,5,"I loved this cake.  I made several other high rated chocolate cakes on the zaar and this one was my favorite, especially coupled with the chocolate butter cream frosting.  I gave my boyfriend's family a big chunk of this cake and they paid me to make another (whole) one!  Flippin' Sweet!",,
843959,2496,2008-05-20,0,"I am a 66 year old male.  I have never baked a cake in my life!  This was fantastic!  Tasted just like my mothers scratch cakes as a kid.  I impelished the recipe a little, by using butter rather then oil.  Also added 1 0z of bittersweet chocolate to the melted butter, and used a mix of coffee and water, instead of just water.  It was rich, rich, rich!  Took me 10 minutes to make.",,
609189,2496,2008-05-22,5,My 10 year old daughter makes this cake all by herself.  And she makes it over and over and over again because every time she does people RAVE about it and it is gone in a matter of hours.  She bakes it in a bundt pan and sprinkles it with powdered sugar. Amazingly delicious.,,
222970,2496,2008-05-25,5,"I can't believe I haven't written a review. This is my standard chocolate cake. I don't want to go back to boxed. Turns out rich and moist.

It just takes a couple of minutes more than making a boxed cake.",,
394865,2496,2008-06-12,5,"I baked this for a Memorial Day BBQ, served it with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream and it was delicious, moist and very rich. I made it with Kittencalâ€™s Chocolate Buttercream Frosting/Icing, Recipe #89207.  There was a little bit of the cake left over but that only lasted a few hours until people snuck back to polish it off. I am definitely through making cakes from a mix...why should I when I have a winner recipe.",,
742667,2496,2008-06-12,5,"I made this yesterday for my out of town family. Very easy to put together and very very rich with ""Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Frosting"". Every one loved it. I did use a full cup of boiling water and didn't have a problem with the cake falling.",,
770398,2496,2008-06-13,5,This was an excellent chocolate cake recipe. The cake was moist and worth the extra effort. I first made as cupcakes for my sons class and they loved them however there were alot of crumbs. Then I doubled and baked in my 18x12 pan for my sons birthday and it baked perfectly. Even with the large pan it did not rise to much in the middle. It was a hit from the kids to the grandparents. Thank you for posting.,,
95499,2496,2008-06-13,5,"This is a great cake.  Very rich and moist.  I baked it for my family and it was a huge hit!!!  Instead of boiling water, I boiled some coffee (not instant) and it was wonderful.  Thanks so much for this great find!!",,
221965,2496,2008-06-14,5,"A great, easy cake. My batter was thicker than most cake mixes, not thin like the description, but came out great. A little on the sweet side for my tastes, so I cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups, and used 3/4 cup of water. It took 30 min. in a 9x13x2"" pan lined with tinfoil for easy removal. I made four of them and iced them together for a huge double-layered cake for a goodbye party. It baked up into perfect 1"" layers with very little sinking in the middle. Thank you Marg! Will definitely be making this again when I want chocolate cake.",,
125640,2496,2008-06-15,5,"I made this for my sister's birthday and it was a hit. I used dark cocoa and reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also subbed coffee extract for 1 tsp of the vanilla. Nice, moist and tender cake. Easy to make and delicious. Thanks for sharing.",,
517443,2496,2008-06-15,4,"Thank you for posting this recipe! I wanted to take a picture of it but, the cake was gone before l had the camera out. I used 34 cup of coffee and thaught the cake wouldnt turn out but, yes it did and very well l might say. The frosting l just wipped up a gnauch. Very tasty and fast cake.",,
438326,2496,2008-06-24,5,"Wow!  This was such a super delicious cake.  My worry with chocolate cake is the texture and tendency to be dry.  This cake was moist, had a fabulous flavor, texture and richness.  I decreased the water to 3/4 cup as recommended.  I used a chocolate ganache filling and also used the dark chocolate buttercream frosting, 208959.  This was for my son's birthday party and it did not disappoint!  Children & adults both loved the cake.  My sister had a piece 4 days later and  said it was heavenly & unbelievably moist.  I concur!",,
141012,2496,2008-06-26,5,"Truly easy to make. Turns out light and delicious. Hard to believe only half a cup of oil is required for such a large cake. I was out of vanilla essence, so used 1 1/2 tsp of instant coffee powder instead. Thought that 2 cups of sugar would be too sweet in the recipe, so I cut down to 1 3/4, but I will go with the 2 cups next time. Needed to be a bit sweeter especially if there isn't going to be any frosting. This time I put on chocolate frosting and it was perfect. Thanks Marg for sharing",,
876946,2496,2008-06-30,5,This recipe is definately a keeper. I made the recipe twice exactly as per the instructions and used it as a cupcake mixture. First time mixture cooked out and over the edge of the cupcake liners so the second time I just didn't use the baking soda. They came out perfectly shaped as cup cakes second time round. Baked for 25min. Added cocoa chips once the mixture had cooled down after adding the hot water.Made a Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting and the two flavours really complimented each other.Had no complaints about this combination only praise. Will definately be using this recipe in the future. Thank You :-),,
536106,2496,2008-07-06,5,I have made this cake on several different occasions and it has turned out great each time.  The cake is moist and a chocolate lovers dream.  Thanks for posting :) !,,
229605,2496,2008-07-09,5,"this is the exact recipe on the back of the hershey's cocoa can. it does make the most fantastic chocolate cake, the one i return to over and over.  i've made it using 1/2 coffee and 1/2 water, and using all coffee.  the coffee gives it an even richer flavor and we prefer it over plain water. YUM!!",,
651269,2496,2008-07-12,5,Need more stars.  This cake was so good it didn't have to have frosting.  I just made a quick chocolate cream cheese frosting for the top and center of the cak.  My family and I loved it!!!  I did add about 2-3 tablespoons of Irish coffee liquer to the batter.  It gave it just a little extra ooomph!,,
881884,2496,2008-07-13,5,I have been making this chocolate cake as long as i can remember.  Fool proof and very moist. The best chocolate cake in my opinion.,,

352042,2496,2008-07-22,5,"AMAZING! This is the best chocolate cake ever... exactly what I was looking for... and delicious topped with some homemade chocolate syrup. I will admit, I wasn't expecting much because the recipe sounds so simple... but it is simply delicious.",,
314259,2496,2008-08-01,5,"This cake is wonderful. I made it tonight, and everyone in my family really thought it was delicious. It is VERY rich, and is a true, restaurant worthy chocolate cake. Best of all, it wasn't that difficult to make. Thanks for sharing!",,

905185,2496,2008-08-07,5,"I made cupcakes with this recipe and they turned out beautiful!  I didn't know how rich they would taste without butter, but they were moist and rich.  The cupcakes sprung back nicely when I took them out of the oven.  They weren't too dense and not too fluffy and airy.  It was a perfect cake texture and tasted so amazing, I ate 3!!  I love this recipe!",,
895628,2496,2008-08-08,5,"This cake is FABULOUS, half of it was eaten BEFORE the dinner party! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I added one teaspoon of cayenne pepper, as well as one teaspoon of cinnamon to give it a nice spicy kick!  If you are adventurous in the kitchen give it a try!",,

945124,2496,2008-09-05,5,"Absolutely delicious- just having another slice now!! Very moist even the next day. I don't really like icing, but my husband LOVES it and ate the icing off my cake and the rest of the contents of the bowl. Have decided to make the cake one with icing , one without!! yum yum yum. We used Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting/Icing made with whipping cream.",,
167046,2496,2008-09-05,5,"I swore I reviewed this already! Oh well, here goes...
This is my ""perfect"" chocolate cake. I'm a cake decorator (hobby, not pro) and this is my go-to recipe for chocolate cake. Perfect chocolate-y flavor and density. I don't know who made it ""first"" (I got it off cake central) but I love them! I've never had a problem with it sinking or cracking, and it tortes beautifully. Thanks!",,

323933,2496,2008-11-23,5,"Wonderful recipe!  Very easy to make.  I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil and made both mini cupcakes and a round cake.

Thankyou so much for the recipe!",,
824349,2496,2008-09-09,5,"I was looking for a homemade chocolate cake that was super moist and tasted more like a box mix without all the ""yuck-stuff"" (ie preservatives, trans fats, etc).  Something I could feed to children and not feel guilty about! I tried A LOT of recipes, and this was the winner.  I make them as cupcakes, and I do have issues with them settling a bit when cooling, so I will take the hint from Marg and reduce to 3/4 cup liquid next time.  A nice sub. for boiling water is hot, fresh coffee.  A flavored coffee, like hazlenut works well too.  No coffee? Swing thru a Starbucks and grab a tall (small) to go! I have topped these with my Crushed Strawberry, Raspberry, Chocolate, and Cafe Mocha Buttercreams... all have turned out yummy!  When making a batch for adults, especially for the office, they go nuts for the cafe mochas.  I top them with a chocolate covered esspresso bean... Gone in minutes!  It's funny to watch full-grown adults sneaking seconds and thirds with guilty little grins on their faces!!",,
927697,2496,2008-09-14,0,this was super duper simple and yet so wonderfully delicious....i can make this everyday...and i made it without using the mixer...i merely used the ladle and it worked really well...quite superb texture...i even added in some grinded peanuts to add some crunchy flavor....soooo easy....will be a keeper in my kitchen...,,
375776,2496,2008-09-15,5,"I made this for my son's 10th birthday.I doubled the recipe to get 2 large and 1 small cake to make a castle cake.Everyone loved it.I', making it again today for my kids and to take to darts tonight.Thanks for a fantastic recipe that is going to be in my ""make again"" folder :)",,
486680,2496,2008-09-20,5,Beautiful!  Rich and moist.  Going by previous reviews I was going to make a double recipe so the shrinking wouldn't affect the size of my completed cake.  Well I am glad I stuck to the single! It didn't shrink nearly as much as expected.  I filled it with a vanilla buttercream flavoured with boysenberries and juice and iced it with a chocolate ganache and chocolate curls.  Delish! Thanks so much!!!,,

749879,2496,2008-10-04,5,"This is the BEST chocolate cake recipe, and its soooo easy.  I loved not having to cream butter or shortening!  I think ""slightly longer"" is the right word to use in comparing this to a box mix, because you just have to measure 4 more ingredients out.  It is also very moist.  (I live at 7000 feet and reduced baking powder to 1 tsp, and used almost 1 cup boiling water)",,
80353,2496,2008-10-10,5,My kids were thanking me for making this cake for them yesterday - how could I possibly give it anything less than 5 star?  Very tender and moist.,,
613661,2496,2008-10-14,5,It is an easy recipe to make. The taste is wonderful and rich. Very chocolatey! I used Hershey's cocoa and am very pleased with the flavor. Kids and hubby liked it very much. I used Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting/Icing. The darkest version. The cake stays well in the refrigerator and is even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe.,,

1014315,2496,2008-11-04,5,"Sensational! I made this for my brother and sister's joint birthday and the family loved it. I used a chocolate glaze and decorated it with strawberries and blue berries, and served it with a thick quality cream. Very moist, and not overly sweet, or too rich. Will definitely use it again.",,
772912,2496,2008-11-17,5,"This is a really great cake. I was having a serious chocolate craving the other night and didn't feel like running to the store. This recipe was all ingredients I normally have on hand. I used dark cocoa and added some instant coffee to the boiling water. It was incredibly moist. Even now, two days later.",,
288704,2496,2008-11-18,5,"Finally found the perfect chocolate cake recipe!. My husband loves dark chocolate and most other recipes just end up too sweet for our taste. I used Hershey's special dark cocoa (dutch processed) and voila! nice texture, rich & delicious cake!. The only thing different that I did is I used orange extract instead of vanilla and added 1 teaspoon of rum & 1/4 cup of roughly chopped 70 % dark chocolate bar into the batter. This is definitely a keeper for years to come... I can't wait to make one for thanksgiving and show it off. 
Thank you so-so much Marg.",,
479051,2496,2008-11-19,5,This is by far the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I used this recipe a few weeks ago for my brother's birthday --everyone loved it-- and am planning on making it again today.,,

I made this for Christmas Eve and asked my family to rate it from one to five and it was unanimous that this was the best cake we ever had. Even my brother, who is a very picky eater and the world's biggest food critic said he would eat the whole thing if he could. My compliments to the creator of this recipe. Thanks for the best cake recipe ever! :o)",,
319854,2496,2008-12-26,5,"Excellent, excellent cake. Moist, tender, not crumbly. I am doing this for a wedding cake in January. The first time I made it, it fell, but I think that I just opened the door too soon. Just don't touch it until you reeeally think that it's done, then check it. This fit two 8x2 round pans just perfectly. Yields 4 and 3/4 Cups of batter, but that's deceiving. The 8x2 pans should take 3.5 cups to fill them once baked, but this recipe rises a lot, and split between those two pans it fits them exactly. 

To determine how much batter you need for specific pans, you should use 79% of the ammount the pan usually takes.",,
650373,2496,2008-12-28,4,"Good, easy, homemade chocolate cake! I am glad I read reviews that mentioned the thinness of the batter, because  I was doubtful about whether or not it would bake properly, and may have added some flour to thicken the consistency. I was pleased with the taste of the cake, although the cake cracked on the top when I baked it - maybe it was my technique?",,
1106321,2496,2009-01-01,1,"Awful awful recipe.  The water made the batter way way too thin, which caused my cake to completely overflow in the oven and make a huge mess.  But then when I took the cakes out of the oven, they completely fell to the point where there was barely any cake in the pan (less than a centimeter left in the pan).  I would use a bigger pan and no water, but I'm not even sure that would help.",,
60504,2496,2009-01-02,5,Awesome awesome recipe. Turned out beautifully for me. I also added a cup of chocolate chips in the batter. This is my go to recipe now for chocolate cake.,,

It is the best chocolate cake I've had and everyone who tastes it agrees.  I stuck with the 3/4 cup of water like suggested and it came out perfectly every time.  It does rise A LOT, so make sure you don't overfill the pan.  As for the 8 inch cake pans, I did use those once, too, but I used 3 pans instead of 2 and made it a 3 layer cake and had no problems with overflowing, although it did come close to the top of the pan!  Like others, I ice it with kittencals chocolate buttercream.  Delicious!",,
215641,2496,2009-01-11,5,"My family loved this cake, my son going so far as to call me ""the best cook ever"".  I made a lower-fat, lower-calorie version of this recipe by substituting splenda for baking (the one w/ half sugar/half splenda) for the sugar, egg beaters for the eggs, used skim-milk, and halved the vegetable oil, and it turned out very well.  It was moist and very tasty.  I will definitely make it again, and expect it will become my default chocolate cake recipe from now on.",,
1139655,2496,2009-01-22,5,Absolutely delicious! i would love to make it again and present it like in the photo (strawberries and nuts). what choclate sauce/icing is used there?? could someone pls let me know. thankyou,,
260911,2496,2009-01-28,5,"Very good, chocolatey cake.  The only substitution I made was chocolate milk in place of white milk.  I baked in a 9x13 pan and it took about 45 minutes.",,
546012,2496,2009-01-31,5,wonderful!! baked up well. i doubled the recipe and made 2 9x13 pans that baked around an hour. thanks so much!!,,

1101019,2496,2009-02-16,2,"First off-- if you do this as cupcakes be warned: it rises a lot.  I filled them up to where I normally do and it overflowed into my oven, causing smoke and then they fell b/c too much was in the tin.  Also, be sure to grease and flour well (perhaps with shortening) because mine stuck.  Lastly, it really wasn't very good.  I ended up tossing it all (and having quite a mess to clean up from the overflow) and making my traditional chocolate cake.",,

791416,2496,2009-02-18,5,As if this recipe needs another review! This cake was irresistable. I bought normal chocolate icing from the store and topped the cake with that and raspberries. I also used skim milk in place of whole milk to reduce the fat. Mmmmmmm.,,
1251627,2496,2009-06-23,5,Completely worth the extra prep time! I love chocolate and boxed chocolate just doesnt do it for me. I also like it with chocolate ganache and strawberries in between the layers. The strawberries are such a delightful touch of natural sweetness amist layers of richness. ,,
620763,2496,2009-02-20,3,"This cake tasted really good, but it completely overflowed in the pan. I only used 3/4 cup of water after reading other reviews about it overflowing, but it still did. I am so glad I placed my pan on top of a cookie sheet or the whole oven would have been smoking. Because it overflowed I had all dried up batter stuck all over the pan. What a mess!  I will not be making this recipe again.",,
1177043,2496,2009-02-25,3,"I cooked this for an hour and a half and the skewer still didn't come out clean. Turned the oven off and it was rubbery inside - no hint of crumbs or cake texture.

170206,2496,2009-02-25,5,This cake is great!  Very moist and very tasty  First time I made it we didn't have any icing and the 13x9 pan only lasted a couple days.  The second time we made a layer cake with a butter cream icing..wow!  I used a whole wheat pastry flour.,,
265956,2496,2009-03-04,5,This should get 10 stars!!! I baked it in a 9x13 pan and cooked it for 35 minutes. I boiled 1 cup of water and used what did not evaporate. My guess would be about 3/4 cup. My daughter and I almost decided not to bake the cake and just eat the mix. I'm so glad we did. I will no longer be buying those boxed cake mixes. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!,,
1120107,2496,2009-03-05,5,This cake made my Valentine's Day great!  This was the first recipe that was actually chocolatey enough for DH.  We used the frosting recommended and put fresh strawberries on top.  Just wonderful.  Thanks again!,,
522275,2496,2009-03-07,5,"Very easy, extremely moist, and went over well at my husband's birthday party!  I mixed up all the dry ingredients a few days early and stored in a ziploc bag.  When it came time to make the cake, it was easy to add the liquids and bake. I frosted with Recipe #33520.  DELISH!",,
933679,2496,2009-03-17,5,"I give this cake 5 stars, it was so good, not too overly sweet. My family loved it, even my son who does not even like cake raved about it. I have made it 3 or 4 times and I used 3/4 cup of water also. I iced it with Easy Chocolate fudge frosting by Laudee #32209! Excellent!",,
1203877,2496,2009-03-19,5,"I made this 2 days ago, and it was just finished. I was out of plastic wrap and it stayed moist the entire time.",,
651118,2496,2009-03-21,4,"This is probably the best tasting chocolate cake I have ever had, I am only giving it four stars though because I have noticed it is kind of a touchy recipe. I have probably made this cake about eight times, and only once has it turned out perfect. Most of the time it falls, or sticks to the pan pretty badly (but it's more my fault that it sticks!). I live in Salt Lake City at about 4,000 ft., but can normally get away without doing the high altitude adjustments. I'm not sure if my problems have been from that or not. I finally found that 2/3 cup water and an extra half cup of flour work perfectly for my elevation and oven. I have tried using cake flour in this recipe (I do for most cake recipes), but this one really doesn't need it. The cake is already really soft, if that makes sense. It really tastes fabulous and chocolately, though. It is really moist and fudgy too. Thanks so much for posting, it was well worth the work trying to figure out the conversions! Oh, just one more thing I noticed about it sticking- I can normally just spray my cake pans with non stick spray, but this cake always sticks when I do that even though I have pretty good pans. If I grease with crisco and flour them, they come out much better. Just thought I would point that out- Thanks again!",,
252316,2496,2009-03-22,5,O my - this cake was amazing.  I agree however that it falls in the center but it was so good noone cares.  I made chocolate frosting but it didn't need it.  This is SO MUCH better than the store stuff.  Very moist - almost like a lava cake.  I will be using this recipe from now on!  Thanks for sharing!!,,
845536,2496,2009-03-22,5,"Excellent cake!  

Perfect with the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting :)

Thank you ;)",,
1215696,2496,2009-03-26,5,"Amazing. I make it with the suggested frosting, and it's a hit every time. Wonderful recipe. Next time I make it, I'm going to try including some sour cream to make it even richer.",,
252814,2496,2009-03-28,5,"WONDERFUL! Best chocolate cake that I or my husband, and many of our guests, had ever had the pleasure of eating. But, do remove the cakes from the pan at 10 minutes. We did not, and ended up having to make another batch. (Oh, darn... eat the ""ugly one"") We salvaged one layer, though, and ended up with three. How delightfully decadent!",,
1055792,2496,2009-04-02,5,I love almost any type of sweet but I live in a family of chocoholics. I became supermom the day I tried this recipe. My husband practically ate the whole thing! I paired it with the Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting for the perfect dessert.,,
667692,2496,2009-04-03,5,"My families mouths haven't been empty since I found this recipe.  I've been cooking for 30 years and this is...by far...the BEST chocolate cake recipe I've ever found.   It's dark, it's moist, it's easy....it's fantastic !  Marg, you're a hero at my house...  LOL  Thanks for sharing !!",,
438204,2496,2009-04-23,5,It's the two cups of sugar.  That's the secret ingredient.  Nothing like refined carbs...yum:),,
1244262,2496,2009-04-23,5,"Beyond fabulous. Instead of the boiling water as instructed, I started with a shot of espresso and added boiling water to equal 3/4 cup. I also decreased the sugar just a hair (by around 1/8 cup). I'm sure the recipe is wonderful as written; I just like to tweak things my way :-)  It came out wonderful.",,
162158,2496,2009-04-25,5,"Made this for my son's birthday...SOOO easy!
My husband wanted me to use a box mix and I argued it was cheaper and as fast to make home made.He was amazed at how fast this came together and the taste was fantastic! Best of all it was so economical.
It took me less than 10 minutes to get it mixed and in the oven, including  the pans preparing pans!
The flavor was moist and a nicely  rich  chocolaty flavor and rose very nicely. I choose to use a whipped vanilla frosting with milk chocolate shavings on top.
Was a hit with everyone!",,
826796,2496,2009-04-26,5,"Moist, rich, delicious cake - exactly what I was looking for! I would definitely make this again. Very easy to put together and received many compliments all around. I topped with buttercream frosting and the sweet icing complimented the cocoa flavour very well. Thanks!",,
349458,2496,2009-05-01,5,great cake!,,
869184,2496,2009-05-02,5,Absolutely amazing! Moist and the flavour is astounding.This is THE chocolate cake. I made a double batch for 2 x triple 8 inch layer cake. I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar (x2 for the double batch) and this was just right for us. Used 3/4 cup of water. I made them in advance and froze the layers for a couple of days. I have not had the cake 'fresh' but I cannot imagine that it could possibly get better. So - it can definitely be frozen for GREAT results. Used Recipe #89207 which was perfect to go with it.,,
1227397,2496,2009-05-02,5,Fabulous cake.  I saved a bit back and cooked it in a mug in the microwave for a couple of minutes because I couldn't wait!  Absolutely delicious and really rich but not too heavy.  Took 1 hour to cook in a square tin but my oven is a bit erratic!,,
743602,2496,2009-05-04,5,Excellent cake. I have been looking for a rich dark chocolate recipe and this fits it. I made another chocolate cake last week and my husband said ther was no comparison. So I guess I will be making this one more than just the once.,,
43216,2496,2009-05-10,5,SOOOOOOO good. This was gone in a flash. It's the perfect chocolate cake in my opinion.,,
747477,2496,2009-05-12,5,Simply perfect.,,
104295,2496,2009-05-14,5,"Perfect for what I needed, a not too hard to make chocolate cake that I could make in layers and frost.  Thanks.",,
262966,2496,2009-05-16,5,This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe b/c it is so super moist!  I found it on the back of a Hershey's cocoa can and haven't used another recipe since.  I use it all of the time with different icings depending on whether or not I am decorating it for a birthday or just a casual get together.  Nothing beats this recipe!!,,
1270264,2496,2009-05-17,5,"This Recipe calls for simple ingredients and  is  very easy to make .  Super moist and Super delicious  , Thanks for the Recipe",,
801264,2496,2009-05-21,5,Super moist and delicious. Who would of thought the answer to moist fluffy cake was a cup of boiling water. Dare I say it but this cake has the same moist flavor you would get from a box but you get to take all the credit and there is no artificial addatives and flavoring.  I baked mine in a 13x9 pan and 35 min was spot on for my oven. I cant wait to try your frosting nex time I make this. Thanks fo posting.,,
1273273,2496,2009-05-30,5,Absolutely wonderful!  I really enjoy making my cakes from scratch and this one is very moist and flavorful.  I put strawberry icing on mine.  Will never go back to box mix again!  Thanks.,,
938859,2496,2009-05-31,5,I made this cake las night with the 261024 buttercream icing and Oh my gosh was it great!! The perfect chocolate cake. My boys really loved it too!,,
1275505,2496,2009-06-04,5,"Just made this cake for my birthday, only substituting the flour.  Great cake!",,
1147428,2496,2009-06-18,5,"Wow - so good!!! I was a little worried after adding the water, as the batter seemed so thin, but it baked up perfectly. So light, airy and moist, yet rich and chocolatey. I baked a cake in a 13x9 pan to test the recipe (took just about 30 minutes to bake) and in a couple weeks I'll be baking some 9 inch rounds for my wedding cakes. Excellent recipe!",,
1089106,2496,2009-06-20,5,"Mmm....I made it in two 9"" cake pans and it tasted great. One of the great parts was that it leveled off. Usually my cakes are puffed at the top which makes it hard to frost and I have to cut the top off the level it...but these came out flat. It was also very chocolaty and moist. Definitely the chocolate cake I'll be making again.",,
1207122,2496,2009-06-21,5,"I've never made a cake from scratch, and this recipe was not only easy but tasted amazing! The texture was silky, and the flavor was rich but not fake tasting. I made this with a strawberry filling for a friend's birthday, and already have a request for another!",,
1283335,2496,2009-06-22,5,This was sooo deliscious!!! Very easy to make..my only prob was when I went to take out of pans it fell apart but i think its because I had not put enought flour? But still it was great =),,
973349,2496,2009-07-01,5,"Worth every penny and time i spend to make this cake. I used this recipe to make a cricket cake for my neighbor's father in law. It came out awesome. She said the whole cake was finished in 20 min between 20 people. it was a 2 layer 13in by 9 in cake. Wonderful is what i can say. Moist, dense and rich chocolaty.",,
246162,2496,2009-07-01,5,perfect,,
1022468,2496,2009-07-05,5,"Well this definitely deserves its star rating. I used whole wheat flour and so reduced the oil accordingly. It was absolutely the best cake I have ever had, so will be making it for birthdays from now on. Thanks, Marg!",,
1133190,2496,2009-07-12,5,Excellent! I made it for my dad for fathers day (a dark chocolate lover) and he was highly impressed. I'll be making this again!,,
638808,2496,2009-07-17,5,This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I filled it with chocolate ganache then i put a butter cream frosting along the outer edges. I think out of the half dozen or so times I have made this this time was the best. I think the guys at 15th ces will love this. THANK YOU,,
173306,2496,2009-07-17,5,"Wow, dense, moist, chocolatey!  I did add chocolate chips like others said and they sank to the bottom so I don't recommend that (my fault).  It *tastes* incredible though.  I used frosting from Recipe #212496, and added some because it wasn't quite enough.  Great combination and very rich.  Thanks Marg!",,
1159335,2496,2009-07-20,5,I used the dark chocolate cocoa and it was SOOOO good. It was the best chocolate cake I have ever had. It was so moist. My husband said it was the best birthday cake ever and my family said this recipe is now a tradition!,,
311625,2496,2009-07-21,5,"Nom nom nom...This is so...nom nom nom...Yummy. Sorry, had to finish devouring the last piece while I was writing this. Made as directed, though with soy milk, homemade vanilla, and as Marg suggested somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 C. of boiling water. Used on recipe #42282 and they were unreal together. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Marg!",,
820326,2496,2009-07-21,5,"Wow!  What a wonderful cake!  Even as it was baking, my friend was sniffing the air in ecstasy.  The cake was light and moist and tasted great with Kittenca's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting and a nice strawberry filling (Recipe #10045).  I added about 3/4 cup of really strong coffee (rather than 3/4 cup boiling water), which did a beautiful job of enhancing the chocolate flavor.  I served this during a birthday potluck and my guests couldn't get enough of the cake!  It was gone by the next morning!  Thank you for such a great recipe!  I'm pinning it up as my official cake recipe.",,
581862,2496,2009-08-03,5,I just used regular cocoa and it was awesome.  I used a peanut butter frosting and it was so good.,,
1336324,2496,2009-08-03,5,"I have made this cake 3 times this week it was very moist and simple to make .I would say it was the best chocolate cake I have made , I doubled the mixture and it was still perfect, I highly recommend you give this cake a go",,
921940,2496,2009-08-04,5,"This is very similar to the chocolate cake recipe my mother has used my entire life for cupcakes.  Easy and tasty, super moist.  I doubled the recipe to make several different shapes in order to build a train cake for my son's birthday.  It did overflow the mini cupcake and the popover pans (BTW, I don't recommend using popover pans for taller cupcakes - it really doesn't work well.)  The small fire in the oven and the huge mess to clean up left the warning about overfilling permanently in my memory!",,
565592,2496,2009-08-10,5,"great recipe!  great flavor!  I halved it and baked it in two 6"" round pans for 30 minutes...made a great little cake--perfect for two people!",,
1022816,2496,2009-08-15,5,"This is Bellachef's daughter. I love desserts and I love this chocolate cake. Very moist and chocolately. As a substitute in place of the oil, use applesauce and subtract how much applesauce you use from the ammount of water. This is supposed to make it more moist.
sunshine and flowers :)",,
269198,2496,2009-08-18,5,"I am usually a devoted Duncan Hines cake mix fan so I tried this on a whim. I've never had much luck with homemade cakes, usually too dry for my taste. It was excellent, I might just give up cake mix. I made this with a fudgy, chocolate ganache type glaze. It really hit the spot! Son and BF loved it, too.",,
1354289,2496,2009-08-19,5,Simply Exceptional. Need I say more!,,
1102055,2496,2009-08-24,2,This cake is very coarse grained(like bread) and lacking in flavor and sweetness.,,
226989,2496,2009-08-24,3,"I found this cake to be easy to make but really, I didn't find the taste to be that great. It was a little dried than other cakes I've made. It wasn't bad, but not the best I've had.",,
318235,2496,2009-08-24,4,"Pretty good cake, I was looking for a richer chocolate flavor though. It came out well. It did rise a ton! I followed the 2/3 fill suggestion and I still overflowed. Also, I made one with no parchment lining and it got stuck to the bottom even though I sprayed it with Pam, so i would recommend taking the extra step to do the parchment lining. Cake was moist though and the recipe came together well.",,
638563,2496,2009-08-25,5,I made this this afternoon for my husband's and nephews birthdays today.  It turned out great.  I usually use my mom's black moist chocolate cake recipe but I do not have a copy and she was not home to get it and this was the closest I could find.  I should have added the whole cup of water because it was a little dry with 3/4 cup.  Thank u for posting such a greeat recipe.,,
1389322,2496,2009-09-20,5,"Amazing cake! ;D I baked for exactly 30 minutes, turning the cake at around 12 minutes 'cause my oven's hotter on one side. The result was a moist, fluffy, and delicious cake! I used a cream cheese frosting and covered it with toasted coconut....delicious! A keeper for sure - next time it'll be cupcakes!",,
496829,2496,2009-09-23,3,This recipe can also be found on the back of the container of Hershey's Cocoa - there is also a frosting recipe to go with it.  Very good if you like chocolate -- and who doesn't.,,
858501,2496,2009-09-28,5,"Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  I didn't have eggs, so I used applesauce as a binder like someone suggested.  Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and used about 1/2 cup of water.  I also made sure not to open the oven; though the batter seemed thin, the cake rose very nicely.  I finished it with a chocolate ganache and chopped walnuts.  Everyone who tried it couldn't believe it was 1- from scratch, 2-so moist!, and 3- so rich and tasty.  Will DEFINITELY make again.",,
1244045,2496,2009-10-02,5,Everyone loved it. Used Kittencals butter cream frosting. Delish.,,
248264,2496,2009-10-10,5,"This cake is excellent!  I admit it's the first time I made a chocolate cake :D even though I'm a long time cook and baker.  It turned out perfect and was also perfectly easy.  It will be my ""to go to"" cake whenever I want cake for any special occasion or anytime.  I used the buttercream icing recipe (not the chocolate one) and it was also delicious.  Everyone loved it, including my DH and soon to be 3 year old!",,
586022,2496,2009-10-15,5,"This is a winner!  Made this for a family get together and think it will get rave reviews!  I followed the recipe exactly and made a ""test cake"" for myself out of a mini heart pan with some extra batter ( I could only find my 8"" rounds!). The test cake was fab!  It turned out very moist and flavorful.  Next time I will use a deeper dutch cocoa, used Nestle's this time because that is what I had on hand and would love it with a deeper flavor.  I used Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream and made scrolls on top with white chocolate piped from a ziploc with the end cut off.  This is my new favorite chocolate cake!",,
283483,2496,2009-10-23,5,"You want chocolate? This cake delivers deep luscious chocolate in every bite. My son asked for a deep dark chocolate cake with rich dark chocolate icing for his 18th birthday. This fit the bill. I was one happy mama because this recipe made the birthday boy very happy. :) The icing I used was the one suggested. Mmmm, these two recipes go so well together. There is one little change I will make next time. I plan on replacing the boiling water called for with piping hot coffee. One other little thing...I'll be sure to use wax paper rounds in the bottom of my pans. It makes it much easier to get the cake out of the pan. To do this, just trace the bottom of your pan onto wax paper and trim away the excess.",,
73951,2496,2009-10-23,5,A delicious alternative to a cake mix!  Thank you!  I used 1 cup of brown sugar because I was low in white and  1/2 cup of water.  I loved the way that it didn't rise up in the middle and had a nice even top.  I iced it with mint icing and it was fabulous!  Thank you - your recipes are as wonderful as your pictures :),,

I made it using one of those giant cupcake molds and just baked it on a lower temp so it could cook all the way through without burning.  We will have the massive cupcake tonight, but i sampled a bit last night and it was wonderful. Crispy on the top a bit, and wonderfully moist and rich on the inside.  Thank you!",,
553933,2496,2009-11-08,5,"Full 5 stars of ease of preparation and taste.  I did use coffee rather than water and since I only had heavy cream, I used that instead of plain milk.  Very good and moist!  Will make again and again I'm sure. Love the dark chocolate taste!",,
1427401,2496,2009-11-11,5,"I used 1/2 C of water the first time and it was to much. The cake also fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan (but that is my problem). :) This cake is AMAZING to say the least. SO moist and just absolutely delicious.

489310,2496,2009-11-27,5,I have made this recipe several times now.  First as cupcakes and then as a cake for my daughter's second birthday.  I have found that adding an extra egg and about 1/4 cup flour keeps the cake from falling in a high altitude setting.  This cake has gotten rave reviews from everyone who has eaten it!,,
673444,2496,2009-12-11,4,"Easy and chocolate-y good.  I halved this recipe with success and made cupcakes out of the batter.  I wouldn't recommend this as the tops, instead of rising up like cupcakes, flattened, so that when I removed my muffin tin there was a flat layer of chocolate goodness.  Yummy, but not presentable. Next time I'd make it as an actual cake and maybe add some frosting. My bf says it tastes good as is.",,
325318,2496,2009-12-12,5,"Very please with this cake!  It's moist with a really nice chocolate flavour.  I just used regular cocoa and followed the recipe exactly (there's a first time for everything).  It wasn't as fluffy as others that I've made, but the taste totally makes up for it.",,
250031,2496,2009-12-13,5,"Made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was perfect. I bought dark cocoa to make sure it was a ""dark chocolate"" cake. I made a two-layer cake and frosted with Recipe #129329. No need to ever use a box mix when this is so easy and SO good.",,
606329,2496,2009-12-15,5,"Made this today....my first cake made from 'scratch'.  I made it with regular cocoa and used 2/3 cup boiling water, which I mixed in using my mixer.

1391104,2496,2009-12-26,5,No kidding! 325 reviews all saying the same thing and now make it 326. I made this cake for Jesus's birthday cake for our Christmas dinner and my family loves it. We had it with the Butter Cream Icing (tho i only made 1/2 the batch) and we're still enjoying it the day after. It may even taste better cold. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. You've made a baker out of me!,,

I was making it to use as the bottom layer of a Chocolate Mousse cake but I had to scrap it and make a different one because it just didn't taste that good to me. I did use Hershey's regular cocoa since that's all I had on hand but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe the dutch process cocoa really makes a difference. It seems most reviewers put some kind of icing on it too...so that might make it better. I made #31804 as the second cake and used some unsweetened chocolate along with the cocoa and I thought it was much better.",,
510624,2496,2010-01-02,5,"The perfect cake to indulge your chocolate craving. As suggested by other reviewers, I only used 1.5 cups of sugar and added dark choc chips to the hot water. I frosted it using the chocolate butter cream  suggested in this recipe.
Thanks Marg!",,

887970,2496,2010-01-06,5,Very dangerously yummy! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1 tsp of instant coffee granules with the hot water. First attempt at making a cake from scratch and will using this recipe from now on :),,

Thanks a million for sharing it!",,
632604,2496,2010-01-19,5,"Moist, tasty, and surprisingly simple. Even though the cake was made from scratch, it was not all that much more difficult or time consuming than making a cake from a box. Once I added the water the batter had a consistency of grainy chocolate syrup. Flavor has been fantastic. I used standard baking cocoa since I couldn't find dark chocolate cocoa. Cake has been stored in the refrigerator since I frosted it and three days later the cake is still moist and delicious. Frosted it with a peppermint flavored frosting and the chocolate/peppermint combination has been fantastic.",,
1471487,2496,2010-01-19,4,"Very moist, however a little too moist because I couldn't frost it without it falling apart! It has an excellent flavor.  I'll try it again and see what happens.",,
467741,2496,2010-01-20,5,"Very yummy cake.  Husband tasted a scrap piece (carved it flat for a layer cake) and said he thought it tasted like a brownie.

551498,2496,2010-01-27,5,"Perfect! Easy to make, even without a blender (I used a spoon). I forgot I had run out of vanilla so left that out, it was still amazing! It did exactly what the recipe said it would do. It tasted yummy and is HUGE!!!!!! The 20-24 servings is about right if lots of frosting is used.",,

This is a large recipe but last night I doubled it, and made two large ring cakes, which I joined together with cream then iced; it made a rather good looking birthday cake : )) and like usual was moist and delicious.   I have no desire to find a better chocolate cake recipe.",,

It comes out perfect every time...  And I've made it a lot!
I usually use only 3/4 cup of water. And mine always comes out moist and delicious!
I top it with ""Kittencal's Easy Buttercream frosting/Icing"". This icing is really easy and is a ""never fail"" icing...  I love it!!

After reading other reviews, I've decided to reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Turned our great, very moist. Used 9 inch round pan, and poured 1/2 into it. Took 35 minutes. Poured the rest into cupcakes, baked for 25 minutes. The cupcakes turned out a little dry, you might want to reduce the cooking time if you are using cupcakes instead.",,

A tip for newbie bakers who have difficulties getting a level baked cake, roll up a cloth napkin (do it on diagonal for the exact perfect length for 9inch pans) then drench in water. Wrap around the outside of the pan (secure with a cloth hair elastic) and bake as usual. You could put a level on top of baked cake and it would be perfect.

This is heaven. Truly.",,

Edited Feb '10 to say I have made this 4 times now and the recipe is actually foolproof.  Most recently made for my sons birthday - split and filled with sweetened cream and covered in kiwi and raspberries. See photo. Thanks again,,
1052827,2496,2010-02-27,5,This is a great recipe both dense and moist and easy.  I tried to bake it in one 9 inch springform pan and I don't reccomend it.  I had to leave it in the oven too long to cook it and that made the edges dry and they broke off.  Nothing that I could not fix with icing but the 2 pans recommended is the way to go.,,

This time I made it with cake flour to see if it helped with the center (1 & 3/4 cup + 2 1/2 tbls.)  It worked.  Love the recipe!  I pair this with Satin Chocolate frosting #12176.   Beautiful & Scrumptious!",,
1567641,2496,2010-03-14,5,I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was scrumptious!!! I can't have dairy so I used soymilk and I went the 2/3 C. water route. It's a super moist cake so be sure the grease and flour the pans well- I had so trouble getting it out in one piece. I frosted it with a marshmallow fluff and chocolate fudge- Heavenly!,,
199839,2496,2010-03-30,4,Very good moist chocolate cake! I used 2/3 cups hot water and made cup cakes with the batter and had no trouble with the centre falling.This was very good with a Vanilla Icing!,,

Thanks for such a great recipe Marg.",,

362983,2496,2010-04-25,5,"This took NO time at all! I read through sooo many of the reviews and got really excited to make this cake and it still went above and beyond my expectations! I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 3/4 cup boiling water.. also added a tiny bit of instant coffee for a little oomph. The cake is actually still cooling down right now, but I used a bit of the batter to make mini chocolate cupcakes and those are DELICIOUS! Only took 10 minutes for those to bake, then I topped those with some frosting (89207) and chocolate sprinkles and oh man, I am so excited to share both the cake and cupcakes with everyone. Baked the cake in a rectangular pan (mine was a touch smaller than 13x9 so it only took like 32 minutes to be perfect) The cake hasn't sunk at all! Rose beautifully and it's still ginormous! Can not wait to ice it and dive in. I'll have to try a round layered cake next time too! Thank you so much!!! :)",,

Turned out yum as usual;  I halved the recipe and made it in a glass 8x8 dish for 35 min. and subbed almond extract for the vanilla (as I usually do) and added just a splash of vanilla extract.  It turned out just as good as when I make it in a 13x9. Thanks for posting!",,

i tried the buttercream frosting with regular sugar since i didnt have confectioners sugar.. came grainy, so next time will be doing just as per the recipe.. great for a birthday cake too will  be making the same for my son's 2nd.. Thank you for the recipe",,

Instead of making a standard 9 in cake, I wanted to do them in individual small sizes so I baked mine in large ramekin cups and they turned out beautiful and very cute. This is going to be my go-to chocolate recipe from now on.",,
116137,2496,2010-06-06,1,I know that I'm in the minority but this recipe did not work out for me at all.  I made 48 mini cupcakes and 12 regular sized with this recipe and they turned out hard as a rock and crumbly.  I couldn't even get the paper wrappers off of them.  I didn't care for the flavor. That might have been the cocoa I used but I tend to think not as it tastes great when I make Recipe #32204.  I ended up throwing it all away and scraping my pans because of the overflow.  This may turn out if you are making a pan cake but I do not recommend it for cupcakes.,,
887863,2496,2010-06-14,5,"Great for cupcakes! It made 24 (slightly overflowing) cupcakes for my sons birthday party.  They turned out great.  I baked mine for 15min.  I checked them at 10 min.

802146,2496,2010-06-23,5,It was a hit! I took another rater's suggestion and used only 1 and a half cups of sugar because I layered the cake with chocolate mousse and covered it with chocolate ganache so I knew that the cake didn't need to be sweet with all the other components.  It came out great! My guests were impressed and actually complimented the cake part itself.  I forgot to take a picture and I really regret it because it came out beautiful for my first cake not out of a box.,,
1584154,2496,2010-07-06,5,This is an excellent chocolate cake! I halved this recipe and it made 16 regular sized cupcakes. Baked at 350* for around 14 minutes and they came out prefect and moist!

For cake batter from scratch, this was so easy! For me, they took a bit longer to bake (about 20 minutes at 350F) than some reviews said, although it might be my oven. Some sunk a little in the middle but that just meant I had to add extra frosting ;) Everyone is gobbling these up and raving about how good they are!!! Great texture, very moist. I will surely be making this recipe again soon!",,

1406893,2496,2010-08-23,0,"UPDATE 8/23/10<br/>I've been making this recipe everytime I want chocolate cake that's amazing :) The BEST is when Sprouts has their double dutch-processed cocoa powder in for the holidays, otherwise it's just the tollhouse cocoa powder.<br/><br/>I am making cupcakes for my diabetic father, and I tried this with Stevia in the Raw -- Noooo. It gives the batter an odd taste, which was very disappointing. <br/><br/>So I switched back to Splenda! I used 1/2 cup of the brown sugar Splenda, and 1/2 cup of the Splenda for baking. Plenty sweet and still fluffy and fairly moist. I went with a full cup of the boiled water, which is what I believe gives this the moistness. And so there you go! :) It can be made with Splenda, just take the total amount of sugar down to 1 cup. Like I said, very sad about the Stevia not working, but I've always heard mixed reviews on it. Maybe one day there will be a good sugar substitute without dextrose or maltdextrin and sucralose snuck in. I hate to think what this does to the body. <br/><br/>Till then, for me and my DH, it'll be just regular sugar in moderation. One day I'll try this with raw sugar and see how it does -- till then, STILL AN AWESOME RECIPE :D",,

Not this one though, it was perfect!! The only thing I'll do differently next time is be more generous with the pan prep.  I was pretty skimpy with the grease and flour and I had a little bit of a hard time getting it out (my own fault, not the recipes fault). Awesome cake recipe that I will definitely use again!!",,

This came out wonderfully. I used it with 89207  I think is the number, for the frosting.  Wonderfull, will make it again and again. <br/>Thankyou, next time I will try the dutch cocoa",,
826406,2496,2010-09-18,5,Wonderful cake. I used 2/3 C of strong hot coffee in lieu of the water. I also used Trader Joe's unsweetened cocoa powder. I filled it with a raspberry/blueberry filling (#152347) and topped with a chocolate buttercream frosting. Two 9in cake pans baked perfectly for 30 minutes in my oven.

I made it as 2 x 9 inch rounds and sandwiched them together with some of my favourite buttercream icing.

The top was very crumbly--hard to spread frosting on, and the taste just average.  I'm not trying to plug one of my own recipes, but Moist Chocolate Cake (#2766846) is hands down more delicate, tastier, attractive, and most important--pretty much fool-proof.

First of all, it was the first cake that did not come neatly out of my pan (yes, it had been generously greased, yes I let it cool first)...  so, I used one layer (in the pan) for my daughter's birthday cake, and ended up turning the other into cake balls because it came out in a million pieces.

Guests at the wedding also loved it and kept complimenting me. I made this cake again for a friend's baby's first birthday and several people said it was the best cake I had made to date!

However it lacks the richness that i look for in chocolate cakes -- owing i think to the fewer eggs used and no butter. Also, i substituted espresso coffee for the water, which turned the cake a bit more bitter, losing much of the sweetness. A tip to those wishing to use coffee -- add more sugar to the mixture, or substitute only half the water. Instead of a chocolate frosting, I whipped up a creamy chocolate sauce and smothered a cake slice with the warm sauce -- a fantastic idea, it seemed, and added the richness that was lacking in the cake.",,

I used new Hersey's Special Dark Chocolate cocoa powder because I didn't have time to get any good cocoa powder (I plan on ordering some from King Arthur Flour to try in this recipe) and it was good! But I can imagine that the cocoa powder makes all the difference in this recipe!! So don't skimp!! Get the good stuff!<br/>I added a tablespoon or so of instant espresso to the water to give it a bit of depth- next time I might even add more. And I used Chocolate Buttercream Frosting  from Mimi in Maine- which I also added some espresso to.<br/>This one is a keeper! Thanks!,,
1077898,2496,2011-06-05,0,I have made this recipe about 5 or 6 times now - all with perfect results!   Thank you for this yummy cake recipe! <br/><br/>Salt Lake City,,
1826030,2496,2011-06-05,5,"Omygoodness!!! This is ABSOLUTELY Delicious!<br/>I am so bad at making cakes, I've tried so many on this website and thought, why not make another one and see how bad it comes out, but NO! this recipie is so easy, so simple and Mygosh the cake is so MOIST and delicious, I am already planning on making another one, the one I baked yesterday is already finished.]<br/><br/>Thank you so much for sharing such a great recipie, highly appreciated!",,
142559,2496,2011-06-12,5,"Stunning cake!!  Incredibly moist and delicious - super easy!! I halved the recipe and made two 6-inch layers for my husband's birthday cake.  I topped with a light coconut buttercream and toasted coconut.  Thank you so much for posting!! Hands down, the best chocolate cake I've ever had!",,
944660,2496,2011-06-17,5,Great recipe! Made a couple tiny changes; used weak coffee instead of the boiling water and baked this in 3 8 inch pans due to me not having 9 inch ones. I baked for 25 minutes and the cake was PERFECT! My son is in heaven over his triple decker birthday cake and has stated that this is The Cake Recipe for his birthday from now on. Thank you very much for sharing!,,
1813380,2496,2011-06-17,1,"Haven't tasted it yet, but both layers fell while cooking. Made recipe as directed. Not sure, maybe this has to do something with our altitude. I am mile high. Bummer. I am sure it will taste good though and I am sure I can find a way to hide these sad little guys.",,
733461,2496,2011-06-27,0,"Awesome cake!! I have used this recipe over a dozen times now, to make cakes for family and friends%u2026I also use this recipe for cupcakes, because it is so moist and chocolatey. I use 3/4 C of water each time rather the the whole cup, have never had problems! Thanks loads for the recipe Marg, it is part of my permanent recipe book now :)",,
1365750,2496,2011-07-14,1,I have to say that I'm in the minority too.  My cake fell while baking and the batter was super runny.  Then when taking it out of my pans it stuck horribly.  So I tasted part of what was left in the pan and it just tastes like sugar.  No chocolate flavor at all.  This was my first attempt at a chocolate cake from scratch and I guess I'll be heading to the store to get a box mix because I don't have time to give another recipe a go.  Bummer...  I had high hopes given all the good reviews.,,
849812,2496,2011-07-24,5,"This is absolutely an excellent recipe. I will never, ever buy a box cake again. Easy and has a wonderful taste. I made cupcakes, everybody LOVED them. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.",,

817200,2496,2011-10-14,5,"This cake is so easy and delicious! I frosted it with cream cheese frosting, I will definetely be making this again and again!",,
126440,2496,2011-10-17,5,Very easy but delicious cake.  I made half a recipe using a 9X9 inch pan.  Turned out great but may have over baked it a bit.  Baked for 35 min.  I did use the choc. buttercream for the frosting which was also great.  Made for a very rich birthday cake.  Want to try it with coffee next time.,,
1049709,2496,2011-10-20,5,Don't mess with perfection!  When mine was done and it was perfect I decided to make a chocolate sauce; poked holes in both layers and drizzled the sauce over it before adding frosting to make it extra moist and chocolatey!!!! yummy!!!!!!,,
394077,2496,2011-10-30,4,This cake tastes better the next day. I used buttermilk for milk because that is all I had. The cake is moist and the crumb is tender.,,
1800022,2496,2011-11-03,5,I love this cake. I mix it with coffe and use just over 2/3 cup of water.I hope it will be a hit at my Debate tournament.,,
831052,2496,2011-11-17,5,"Perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly (including the note about the boiling water), and it turned out wonderfully.  Everyone complimented it.  My husband, who is more partial to lemon cakes, said it was the best cake he's ever had.  I've already decided that this will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!",,
2069877,2496,2011-11-19,4,I used 3/4 cup of water and it seemed just fine. My husband loved it! It's a Keeper!,,
1434446,2496,2011-11-21,5,Delicious cake recipe!  And the note about the batter being runny is not a joke.  I made it into cupcakes and baked them for 18 minutes.  Paired it w/ Recipe #111131.,,
2086058,2496,2011-11-28,5,I've made this cake four times now and even when I forgot to put in the one cup of milk last time it still came out perfect. Go figure! I've also adapted this with my own flare and made a chocolate mint cake and served it with a mint cream cheese icing and it was wonderful. If you do make a mint chocolate cake you should add one teaspoon vanilla and one of pure peppermint extract. :),,
606850,2496,2011-11-29,5,"I've been making this recipe for decades (I got it from the back of a Hershey's cocoa container), and every time I make a different chocolate cake recipe, I always wish I had made this one instead. The best tip is *not* to use the full amount of boiling water - it tastes EVEN BETTER with somewhat less water! I've tried it with coffee, less oil, double-sifted cake flour ... so many ways to vary it up and still have a fantastic chocolate cake!",,
2090395,2496,2011-12-03,5,"FANTASTIC! i can't keep this in the house, the moment it comes out of the oven i have swarms of people flocking to get some :) i can honestly say this is the best cake i have ever ever had!",,

601753,2496,2012-01-04,5,"OMG, this was amazing!  I made it exactly as written & it is delicious!  Will be making this again!",,
377070,2496,2012-02-11,5,Excellent recipe as the numerous ratings show.  I added a pinch of ground red pepper and used 2/3 of a cup of hot coffee instead of water.    I baked them in tiny silicone muffin cups topping them with a dollop of Decorator Buttercream Icing.  They took only 15 minutes to bake and were a wonderful bite sized treat!,,
1510644,2496,2012-02-14,5,"i just made this cake today and it is sooooo good! I quartered this (which would call for 1/2 an egg, but i used the whole) since i am dieting and dont want a whole cake sitting around that tastes this good! lol<br/><br/>I served it plain with just a little powdered sugar. It did fall a little, but that just made for an almost gooey center that was so good!<br/><br/>update: Its been over a year but i finally made this cake again (nothing against it i just rarely make cake). And it is delicious as it was last time, slightly less moist so it didnt fall (it did stick but i blame my self for not preping my pan correctly). Again i skipped frosting opting for powdered sugar, and an adorable heart and ""Be Mine"" stencil for Valentine's Day! (oh i cut it in half and used just under 1/2c of coffee instead of water)",,
1244997,2496,2012-05-06,5,"Awesome Chocolate Cake recipe, was a huge success and hit. In place of the Boiling Water, I used a 1/2 Cup of Mocha Nut Espresso, it is a nice compliment to the chocolate in this recipe and adds to the depth of flavor. Super easy, and will be my ""go to"" for chocolate cake"". Thank You Marg",,
636029,2496,2012-02-28,4,"I baked this for my husband's 55th birthday.  I made it exactly as stated adding almost the entire cup of water and baking it for 32 minutes.  I hate to say this but it came out dry and my husband and I were both disapointed as it has so many good reviews.  I would give it less stars but possibly it could be my oven as I already know that my oven doesn't bake up evenly.  Although only a couple of weeks prior to baking this cake, I had made some cupcakes from a box as I was expecting company with children and those came out nice and moist and my husband actually liked the cupcakes better than the cake made from scratch.  Maybe I should have taken the cake out a little sooner, I don't know.  Sorry :(",,
1017580,2496,2012-03-14,5,"Fantastic!  I thought I would be sweet and bake a chocolate cake for my husband for Valentine's Day.  The first one I made was awful (not this recipe, but a different one).  So there I was back in the kitchen for my next attempt and this receipe didn't let me down.  My husband took one bite and said now this is a cake.  It was so moist and I don't think I will ever make another chocolate cake again.  Thanks for a tried and true recipe. :)",,
141190,2496,2012-03-15,5,"A very easy to follow recipe, popular with the family, has become my go-to chocolate cake.",,
2214256,2496,2012-03-17,5,I actually shrunk the recipe for 5 people so that I wouldn't waste any cake if the recipe didn't turn out well..but it took me by surprise! It was one of the best chocolate cakes Ive made. Ive swapped flour for spelt flour.. and also used carotino oil instead of usual vegetable oil..used Low GI sugar instead of caster sugar. Turned out so well even without frosting. I was surprised by how thin the mixture was before you bake it.. but it was fine!,,
1760519,2496,2012-03-31,5,"NO FAIL and ALWAYS delicious! I use soy milk, cut the sugar a bit and use just over a half cup of boiling water. I have also made cupcakes and baked for about 20 minutes. They rose and were moist and didn't stick to the paper. My go-to cake recipe. I use Kittencal's Chocolate Icing to frost. I will never go back to boxed!",,
2227625,2496,2012-04-02,0,This cake turned out amazing.I added chocolate frosting to the top of the cake after it was done.I will definitely try this recipe again !:),,
765437,2496,2012-04-08,5,"Wow! This cake is phenomenal. I used instant espresso in place of the water, and baked it in 2 9"" rounds for my mother in law's birthday cake.<br/>We used the mocha butter cream frosting recipe from the Joy of Cooking, and it was the perfect compliment. The outside we decorated with slivered almonds and chocolate covered espresso beans. <br/>Everyone at the party RAVED about the cake. I will definitely be making this one again.",,
2152886,2496,2012-04-10,0,indeed a very splendid chocolate cake ! Yummy!,,
113535,2496,2012-04-13,5,I don't know how I managed to forget rating this recipe (Like you need another 5 star rating ;)) I made this recipe into cupcakes for my dear friend's baby shower. This is easily the moistest (is that even a word) most delicious chocolate cake I've ever had in my LIFE! And I've eatten a lot of chocolate cake. It really doesn't take that much longer than a box mix and for the difference in taste and texture it's so worth it! I'll be making this for a cooking contest tomorrow in a 13x9 and I just know it will give me good scores! ;),,
542624,2496,2012-04-14,5,"Yum, so tasty!  I used Gluten Free flour blend (2:1 rice flour to tapioca starch   xanthan gum) and it still turned out good.  The cakes did fall in the middle a bit, so next time I would probably use just a smidge less water.",,
2242869,2496,2012-04-19,5,I've never baked a cake before and I did not have any vanilla but it was still excellent! I shared the cake with my friends and they loved it! I am so inspired I will bake some more. :),,
868551,2496,2012-04-29,5,"made this last night..very moist and chocolately!! the last 3-4 min of baking, i threw on top a handfull of choc chips and chopped walnuts",,
2268461,2496,2012-05-19,5,We had a big family party and I chose this recipe as one of the many desserts we served.  This cake blew them away!  Everyone loved it.  I'll be keeping this one to make again and again.,,
1906011,2496,2012-05-24,5,I have been searching for a recipe like this.  This cake was great and everyone loved it.  I can't wait to make it again.,,
971256,2496,2012-06-03,5,"I wasn't sure about this cake after it baked up. I followed the recipe exactly but had to undercook by nearly 10 minutes when it was ready, and it just seemed... different.  It was incredibly difficult to get out the pan as well and seemed very crumby.  I had to freeze it solid to get it frostable so it would fall apart in crumbles when I frosted it.  I was quite nervous because I made it for a large group for a good friend's birthday party, but figured they would at least appreciate the attempt.  Anyway, I frosted it with Kittencal's Chocolate Frosting recipe and everyone ate in silence because it was THAT good.  Incredibly moist and chocolately without being too sweet (though I did eliminate just a bit of sugar).  I cannot emphasize how delicious this cake was with the buttercream frosting.  WOW.  Everyone asked for the recipe and I was recruited to make the identical cake for another friend's cake a few weeks from now.  There was not a single piece left.  YUMMY!",,
2318466,2496,2012-07-05,5,I made several cakes from this recipe and froze them. One was eaten a week after freezing and the other was eaten 2 months after freezing. Both were simply delicious!!! Thank you for this recipe. It is a keeper.,,
138795,2496,2012-07-05,5,"In a word, ""Delicious!!!""  This cake is more rich and chocolatey than anything I've had out of a box.  Definitely worth the extra effort to gather up and measure out all the necessary ingredients.",,
2258816,2496,2012-07-19,5,This cake was theee best! It's moist and rich!! It's exactly what a chocolate cake should be- I used buttermilk (vinegar and milk) instead of milk and hot coffee instead of hot water. .... I will use this recipe over and over. Thanks!,,
2216812,2496,2012-08-12,3,"Decent, bare bones chocolate sponge. Tastier than a mix and quicker than a more sophisticated recipe. I suspect children, people who grew up with fond memories of sponge from a box or view cake as simply a frosting delivery device will like this. I used boiling hot espresso and added a bit of creme de cacao to deepen the chocolate flavor. I won't make this for anyone I'm trying to impress, but for kids and the easily pleased, this is speedy and virtually foolproof.",,
2366691,2496,2012-08-17,0,Tried this for my chocolate loving husband's birthday.  BIG HIT.  Easy to make.  Will definitely make it again.  The hints and notes from others helped.  I did add instant coffee to the water for an added boost.,,
2550699,2496,2012-12-08,1,"Completely upset with this recipe.  I haven't even had a chance to taste it, but (despite using the recommended size!!!)  my batter overflowed 10 minutes into the baking process.<br/>How in the world was this not corrected on the original recipe?<br/><br/>Advice:  forget the 2/3 full advice.  If it is over halfway, it will go over!<br/>Delicious burnt cake smell for days. Enjoy!",,
2161703,2496,2012-12-13,0,OMG delicious!!!! I took some suggestions from other reviews.  Normally I do it with butter but this time I decided to go for the veg oil. LOVE IT!!!,,
1499098,2496,2012-12-13,5,"Moist, delicious, and simple! I used the dark chocolate like the recipe recommends and the family is in love! I'm going to try next time with seven minute icing!",,
868098,2496,2012-12-23,5,Made it three times in three days and the family still wants more. Awesome recipe . Thanks for sharing !,,
1088637,2496,2012-12-24,5,"Wow - just served this for Xmas Eve dinner and it was a HUGE hit! I was a little worried about (the handful) of bad reviews - but I can confirm that a) this cooked beautifully in two 9 inch pans in exactly 30 mins and b) came out of the pans easily and in one piece, c) didn't sink after cooling, d) didn't overflow while cooking and e) was totally delicious!<br/><br/>I used just over 2/3 cup of boiling water (didn't try subbing coffee instead) and in fact followed the recipe exactly, to the letter. The cake came out really light, moist and the perfect sweetness.<br/><br/>We used Kittencal's chocolate frosting between the two layers and all over the cake - and that was amazing too.<br/><br/>Last but not least, we ran a vegetable peeler down the long edge of a milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate bar to cover the top with tri-colored chocolate curls - and voila! Better than any chocolate cake that I've ever had from a bakery, restaurant . . . or anywhere!! Seriously!! Would give this six stars if I could!!",,
269575,2496,2012-12-28,5,"very nice, easy to make and tasty, very moist. It had a bit of an oil taste to it which was the only thing I didn't really love, so next time I will try it with melted butter instead.",,
2599386,2496,2012-12-30,4,This was my first ever cake. It's delicioussssss. I think the best cake i've ever had with the right amount of moisture. I'm Miss Chef at home now :D,,
2481929,2496,2013-01-15,5,I did add an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa but other than that I followed the directions. The end result was a luscious & chocolaty cake that paired perfectly with http://www.spectrumorganics.com/shared/recipe.php?rid=108 .,,
771965,2496,2013-06-04,5,Fabulous cake!Made it for my hubby&#039;s birthday and he loved it. I got complimented on how well it tasted and I can say that this is the chocolate cake I will be making from now on. I did add coffee to it instead of just boiling water as some reviewers mentioned this gave it an extra kick. I believe it worked.Thanks.,,
323107,2496,2013-01-24,5,"Whoa! I used this recipe for my first attempt at making chocolate cake from scratch, and, I kid you not, my results were as good or better than a professional bakery's?!?!?! My husband and I have gotten chocolate cake and cupcakes many times from lots of bakeries over the years, so to have something come out of my oven that I whipped up on a whim one afternoon is incredible.<br/><br/>As suggested by other reviewers, I used only 2/3 cup boiling water and mixed in 1 tsp of espresso powder for the coffee flavor. The batter was thinner than I'm used to seeing with boxed cake mixes but it baked up fantastic!<br/><br/>I made cupcakes and my total baking time was about 25 minutes -- however, I did overfill the liners so the 20 minute estimates from other reviewers might be closer to the mark when I next make these.<br/><br/>They tasted kind of bland when they first came out of the oven, even with icing smeared on it (I couldn't wait.) However, once they cooled for 2 hours or so and I piped straight all-butter buttercream they tasted better. Then once they had a chance to sit overnight in a container and the icing crusted up just a bit? OMG, PERFECTION. Richly chocolatey but not overwhelming, not too sweet so biting into it with icing doesn't make you feel instantly toothachey, and the density and crumb are just right.<br/><br/>Seriously just blown away how this recipe is professional, bakery quality. And not much harder than a box of cake mix, just requires a few more measuring cups and spoons. Total keeper!",,
903194,2496,2013-02-01,5,Cake was delicious and moist.  I substituted coffee for the cup of water and it was great.  Family members loved cake. I've made it twice and it is gone within an hour.  I must admit the batter was thin just as you said but it made. I was afraid it wouldn't bake but boy when it was all said and done it was fantastic.  This is my go to cake now.  Thanks for sharing.,,
2674127,2496,2013-02-02,5,This was my first homemade chocolate cake! It came out perfect although I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2!....GREAT RECIPE!,,
2696185,2496,2013-02-16,5,My family made this cake with Kittencal's chocolate frosting for me as a Valentine's day gift and it was AMAZING! It rivals a very popular local restaurant's chocolate cake and I highly recommend that you try this recipe. My family used a 13 x 9 pan and there was a very slight fall in the middle of the cake.,,
2544655,2496,2013-02-26,5,love this cake!!,,
2714084,2496,2013-02-27,5,"The perfect classic chocolate cake!  It is so tasty, moist and not overly sweet.  I made it for my dad's birthday party and all the guests loved it.  Perhaps this is the best of this type of cake that I've ever tried.",,
715963,2496,2013-03-10,5,"The moistest cake we have ever had. Sinking was not a problem, but frosting such a gentle cake was. Anyhow, I've never been foot at it and the taste was all that mattered to me and everyone else eating. Followed the recipe to the letter, using boiling water at a level halfway between 2/3 and 1 cup. (5/6? Lol). Will try espresso substitution next time. And adding cream of tartar, too.",,
161265,2496,2013-03-10,5,"My new favorite chocolate cake!!!  This was a hit for the party where the birthday boy requested chocolate cake.  Very moist.  I used Penzey's Dutch processed cocoa and it was so yummy.  As a strict believer that you follow every recipe as written the first time you make it, I admit, I cheated.  When I had my cup of boiling water ready to pour into my batter, I grabbed the bottle of instant coffee and stirred a tablespoon or so into it.  YUM!  I will always make this cake w/ coffee instead of water now.  To die for.  Now, to find the perfect frosting....",,
2768821,2496,2013-04-03,3,I had a recipe much like this in my &quot;wheat days&quot;.  I altered it only with my gluten free flour and followed the recipe as written.  A great gluten free cake.  Came out perfect.  The hard part was waiting for it to cool so I could frost it and then eat a slice.  Great chocolate flavor.  And certainly no harder than a box mix to make and soooooo much better taste and texture.,,
590189,2496,2013-04-19,5,"This is the recipe on the back of the Hersheys Special Dark Cocoa container.  It turns out fantastic.  Keeps great covered on your counter for days (retains moistness) so you can eat it at every meal.  Trust me, you&#039;ll want to!  The cocoa container also has a frosting recipe that turns out great.  I like to make the cake with dark cocoa and the frosting with regular cocoa.

My new go-to chocolate cake.  Easily converted to gluten free using my favorite gluten free flour. I also added 2 T of ground flax seed and used buttermilk instead of milk as is my standard practice for converting recipes.  Thanks for posting this Marg.,,

I baked it for Christmas and I have a household of chocolate lovers. Will be adding to my permanent recipe box.,,
1104605,2496,2014-02-16,5,"Made a double batch, thinking I&#039;d need it to make the giant cupcake cake I planned for my daughter&#039;s birthday (which required 6 cups of batter). Well, no need to double - I ended up with the giant cupcake, a dozen regular sized cupcakes, two dozen mini cupcakes, and a 8x8 square cake. Doesn&#039;t bother me a bit - never enough chocolate cake! I made it with Ruddy Red Cocoa which is 24% fat as opposed to regular cocoa (12%). Fabulous. Very moist. TIP: Fill only 2/3 of the way in your baking pan, whatever shape you choose - it rises beautifully. I filled my large cupcakes too high and they overflowed the cups and sank in the middle. My fault. I added Raspberry Jam Buttercream for a fabulously decadent dessert! http://www.food.com/recipe/raspberry-jam-buttercream-426448",,

1802666119,2496,2014-04-13,0,"I would give you 10 stars if I could.  The first time I made this cake I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. The second time I made it somehow I looked at the recipe wrong and added 1 and 3/4 cups boiling water.  It REALLY  looked thin (LOL). Since I had done everything but bake it, I went ahead and put it in the oven.  Unbelievable but it was as good as the first.  Oh, and did I mention I did it both times with gluten free flour blends.  This cake is awesome!! Easy, delicious, and foolproof.  My non gluten free friends love it as well.",,
2001725191,2496,2017-09-22,5,It turned out amazing thank you for the recipe,,
736247,2496,2014-04-20,0,"Worked perfectly by following the recipe exactly as is (one of the easiest recipes too). Made two 9-inch round pans and baked at 350F for 30 min. Used between 2/3 and 3/4 of boiling water as suggested. I haven&#039;t tasted it yet but it smells like rich, dark chocolate and it looks very light and moist, not crumbly. I am sure it will taste good!",,

1056692,2496,2014-07-06,5,Wonderful! Used the 3/4 boiling water as recommended and it was perfect. Hubby wanted chocolate cake for his birthday and I&#039;m anti box mixes. Slathered this in Kittencal&#039;s dark chocolate butter cream frosting off this site. Rich dark chocolate perfection. Thanks for sharing. My husband thanks you as well!,,
1802927618,2496,2014-07-14,1,"Maybe I&#039;m missing something, but this cake was meh at best. It completely sunk in the middle; the flavor was nothing exciting, and the texture was just ok. I made sure to use high quality dutch cocoa and felt like it was a waste of ingredients. &lt;br/&gt;A box mix of brownies would have been the same for me.",,

41754955,2496,2014-10-28,1,"I used whole wheat organic flower and the cake had an awful taste and the dough stuck to the pan. It also didn&#039;t rise much.  I couldn&#039;t get  the end product out of the pan, it just crumbled and broke apart.   Maybe it was the flour I used.  I will use plain white unbleached flour next time to see if I get different results.",,

The cake came out perfect the first time.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Now village and city folk from Yunnan, China are enjoying your cake as well.",,
2000346977,2496,2015-07-18,0,Hi this looks so amazing...but I wanted to know..as you have varied between 2/3 and 1  cup for the hot water can you give me a little more help...as in what consistency should I be looking for before adding less or more water. Thanks can&#039;t wait to try it!,,

1605792,2496,2015-09-06,5,"With the slightest of variations, turned ot into a great gluten-free cake just by substituting an equal volume of g-f all-purpose flour and a mere &frac12; tsp of xanthan gum. I thought I got a hint of bean-flour when trying a tiny bit on a finger, so added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract. My family loved it; they went through the entire 9x13 cake in one day. Since my son &#039;hates&#039; cake generally, and I&#039;m the only one who must eat gluten free, this is quite the accomplishment. It&#039;s my first (and only, so far) g-f cake that was as good as those I used to make with regular (wheat) flour.",,

Taste wise I could sit and eat this cake &quot;as is&quot; because it&#039;s flavor is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. I took the advice of another reviewer and used coffee instead of H2O. This is my new go to recipe!!",,

Made this for my daughters birthday and everyone loved it! I made two batches, one with water and one with coffee, they were both awesome, but will use coffee from now on. 

Definitely putting this one in the recipe box!",,
314532,2496,2016-02-15,5,Totally yummy and moist.  Used coffee in place of water for that richness.   I am very fussy about cakes.  Once I actually made three cakes in one day for a birthday.  This recipe is a definite winner.  Thank you for sharing.,,
1802849661,2496,2016-02-15,5,"A lovely rich, moist chocolate cake. I was surprised how easy this was to make and it was certainly decadent!

2001121581,2496,2016-08-09,5,Best chocolate cake recipe ever !,,
2001124991,2496,2016-08-12,5,Perfection describes this cake. I've been searching for the perfect chocolate cake over the years and this one became my all time favorite. The rich chocolatey flavor and moist texture makes it an awesome option for all occasions! Ps. I exchanged the 3/4 cup of hot water for 2/4 cup of hot strong coffee + 1/4 cup of hot water to enhanced all flavors and it turned out great!,,
2001209676,2496,2016-10-28,5,"Halved this recipe, subbed in almond milk, and used half coffee and half water as per other reviewers recommendation. The batter was SUPER thin and adding in boiling water to mix with raw egg in it freaked me out- it went fine, just be sure to go slow! haha! Used a bundt pan as well. Came out of the oven all pretty, glossy, and dark. I let it cool and went to flip it-----NOPE this thing was stuck in there- a pammed out pan. WAY too moist and light for a bundt- my own fault really. BUT WHATEVER I just tried a piece and it was delicious! The texture is excellent, the flavor could be more chocolatey but not a huge deal (even with dutch cocoa). As others said this cake is really sweet- reduce the sugar some and you'll be good and it should help the chocolate flavor pop out more. Overall I would recommend this cake and will make it again.",,
1581225,2496,2017-02-05,5,"Wow, I used this recipe to make cupcakes, and they turned out so tasty, soft and moist. I used kittencal's chocolate frosting recipe for the frosting. Perfect! Everyone loved them.",,
794029,2496,2017-05-01,5,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this before now. This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I've made it several times with &quot;normal&quot; cocoa powder, but today made it with the Special Dark that is recommended. Really a lovely cake. Turned out almost black and I was afraid I'd overcooked it, but no. It was perfect! Topped it with Kittencal's Chocolate Frosting (#89207), also made with Special Dark. Used the lowest amount of cocoa in the frosting and it was a delicious compliment to the cake. Used a cake pan that creates cavities to put goodies inside each piece and filled the cavities with fluffy chocolate and vanilla (alternating) pastry creams. The dark chocolate goodness contrasted with the fluffy light pastry cream was heaven! Just FYI - As the author states, the batter is *very* runny - pretty much liquid. It's weird and seems wrong, but just go with it. Bakes up wonderfully!",,
2001559549,2496,2017-05-29,5,"I love this cake! I use 3/4 cup of coffee in mine. This time I did the recipe as a Bundy cake, baked 40 minutes and used bakers joy with flour on the pan. The cake came out perfect. As soon as it cools it will get a chocolate ganache glaze.",,

My son always requests this cake and I make the Chocolate Buttercream Recipe by Mimi (many times medium to dark chocolate frosting). I suggest using a really good cocoa - I usually use Rodelle from Costco (They only have it Holidays so I stock up! I learned my lesson when I ran out.) The Special Dark by Hershey is also a good choice.,,

Excellent recipe that we'll make again!  Thanks.",,

170333,2498,2004-10-30,0,"I will never make pumpkin pie again!!! It just can not compete with the taste of this. I do agree with Sisty Gin in the fact that 1/2 to 3/4 of the cake mix  would be sufficent. Just a thought; to use the remaining portion of cake mix, use apple filling or cherry pie filling in a 9x9, pour remaining cake mix over the filling, drizzle with butter and bake. Two desserts in the place of one..... yummy.",,

The only change I made was sprinkling cinnamon and sugar lightly on the crust after it had cooled to give it a little more of a kick. I will definitely be making this again, thanks!",,
643883,2498,2008-11-29,5,"I made this Thanksgiving Eve. I followed the advice in the reviews and used about half of the cake mix and 1/2 cup butter. This turned out great and I will be making this many more times, I'm sure. Thanks, Marg!",,

1239026,2498,2009-04-14,5,I love this recipe. I made this for my 1st time this past Easter and my family ate 2 whole pies.  I did however only use 1/2 of the butter and 1/2 of the cake mix and put the ingredients into 2 pie shells. It still tastes GREAT and I will make it many more times.,,
1246445,2498,2009-05-05,0,"This was definitely a 5.  What a great recipe.  Made it for a party and it was a great success.  I did cut the butter in half and used half of the cake as suggested by other people.  It was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe, it is one I will keep and make many times.",,
167527,2498,2009-08-11,5,I cannot believe I forgot to rate this last year!  This is so delicious.  I made this for dessert on Christmas Eve and got rave reviews.  A lot of my guests did not like pumpkin pie or pumpkin.  I am an avid lover and was looking for something to win them over.  This did the trick!  It is not too sweet and is so incredible.  Thank you so much for sharing!,,
962073,2498,2009-09-10,5,"I've made this a few times now.  My father will only eat pumpkin pie for dessert at every holiday until I brought this over and he tried it.  Now he won't eat my pies anymore!!!  This was very good!  I've tired it with 1/2 the cake mix called for and with the full amount.  My mom with the sweet tooth loved the full amount.  I like it better with a little less, about 2/3rds.  It just depends on the level of sweetness you prefer.  Great recipe!  Thanks for posting it!",,

198129,2498,2009-11-01,5,"WOW!! I made this for my Thanksgiving desert, and this will be served in place of pumpkin pie from now on.  It helps to reduce the cake mix and butter or margarine by half, so it's not overwhelmingly buttery or sweet, and it leaves more of a pumpkin layer instead of a bar type dessert.",,
149415,2498,2009-11-27,4,"I have to agree with using 1/2 the cake mix and 1/2 the butter. This is basically a pumpkin pie ""dump"" cake-- and for dump cakes I also use the 1/2 box cake mix and 1/2 cup butter.

1405412,2498,2009-12-11,5,"Wonderful dessert! Nobody in my family, myself included, cares much for nuts in dishes such as these; so I left the pecans out. I have given this recipe out to people every time I have made it for a gathering. My mother even had people calling her for the recipe after she took it somewhere! I'm going to start just bringing copies of it with me! I use half the butter and cake mix called for. Good pumpkin dessert!",,

358796,2498,2010-12-03,5,"I've never made a ""dump cake"" before and found it very odd to sprinkle the dry cake mix on top and then stick it into the oven. However, it turned out great! I only used half of the cake mix based upon reviews from others that it was too sweet and I think that was a good call. I also only used maybe only 1/4 of the butter in the recipe. The full amount seemed insane! Even with the alterations it was great. Everyone loved it and raved about it and the entire pan was gone within an hour.",,

I did it differently than most reviewers. I figured cake mix has the right amount of sugar if you like cake so I cut the sugar added to the pumpkin to 3/4 cup and used 3/4 of the cake mix and a little over half the butter. It turned out perfect!!",,

I use spice cake,  about a cup of sugar, a stick of butter (we prefer rich desserts during the holidays), and walnuts. This is indeed a forgiving recipe, so by all means adjust to your own tastes.

It didn&#039;t come out as thick as I had hoped, so I just layered the pieces on top of each other (looks like a layered pie, crust and nuts on the bottom with crust and nuts in the center) and added whipped cream on top.

155607,2501,2005-08-14,5,"This was fabulous! My kids gobbled it up and then friends dropped by and all said it was delish! When I said it had pumpkin in it, most were surprised and the kids even wanted more",,

I used only three eggs and it still was quite moist (maybe I will add a bit of milk as a substitute for the egg next time to keep the moisture in a bit better). I loved the golden raisins and will add more than a cup next time. Also, I had extra batter left over and made some muffins which only took 30 min. to bake instead of 45. Turned out great as well.",,

230460,2502,2009-02-08,5,"Great recipe! I didn't follow it exactly (I omitted the walnut pieces because I thought it had enough fat with 1 1/4 cups of oil!), but it turned out SO well. Loved it, and so did my guests. I'll be making this again.",,
977616,2502,2009-09-29,4,Wow!  So much fat in this!  But very yummy!  I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts because I didn't have any.  I also used all whole wheat flour instead of half whole wheat and half all purpose.  It was very moist (most likely from all that oil!) and delicious!  Next time I'm going to substitute applesauce for half of the oil and make it a bit less fattening.,,
172684,2502,2010-10-19,5,"Perfection. It called for the perfect combination of spices to pumpkin. The batter was so yummy I almost didn't want to bake it!  <br/><br/>Instead of 'either/or"" on the cloves and allspice, I put 1/16th teaspoon of each together to make the 1/8 tsp called for. At the last minute I found that the only cinnamon I had was some cinnamon-sugar hubby had put into my cinnamon jar (argh!), so I had to""guesstimate"" that about a 1/4 cup of that would make enough cinnamon. It was after I'd added the sugar so my cake ended up with an extra 1/4 sugar. I also didn't have wheat flour so I used regular bleached all-purpose<br/><br/>I also added a handful of sweetened dried cranberries instead of the nuts since hubby is allergic, I think I could have added a lot more as well.<br/><br/>Otherwise I measured and assembled it precisely as written. It was easy and I loved that I just could do it all in my new Kitchenaid mixer! It went very fast and easy. I just let the mixer run on ""stir"" while I asssemble everything as I went.<br/><br/>For the glaze I didn't have powdered milk. So instead of the powdered milk/water combo I used 3 Tablespoons of milk and 3 Tablespoons of buttermilk. The buttermilk overwhelmed it but it did taste good on the cake, but it overwhelmed the cream cheese a tad.. Next time I'll skip the buttermilk idea. (If you use real milk of course you should refrigerate the cake)<br/><br/>Be sure to watch it very closely it will overcook so easy if you leave it even a minute or two longer in the oven than necessary.",,
36803,2509,2003-11-01,5,These were delicious!  Quite a hit with my grandchildren.  I would recommend refrigerating them for at least a day after baking before serving them--much more flavorful than right out of the oven.  ,,
104295,2509,2005-10-18,5,"These are so tasty!  I actually used a squash that had been recommended to us at the pumpkin patch as having a better pumpkin flavor then pumpkin.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour.  My muffin tins tend to be a little small, but I got 36 regular sized muffins and 12 mini out of this recipe.  I sent 12 to school with my son for class snack and we enjoyed the rest.  So glad I chose these for the photo swap #4!",,
394592,2509,2007-10-04,5,Absolutely wonderful!!  These are the perfect taste of Autumn...the lovely pumpkin with the bit of chocolate and just the right touch of cinnamon spice...so very nice!! :)  I cut the batch in half and got a dozen regular sized muffins and 1 giant jumbo muffin cake (for extra Fall time FUN!!:)  I used the mini chips as Marg (CaymanDesigns) had suggested in her recipe#3564 & LOVE the effect!!  I also added a bit of vanilla flavor to heighten the yummy factor (also suggested in the other version of her recipe) - Fantastic...my favorite muffin of the moment!!! - Great recipe - THANKS!!,,

I made a couple of changes to make it fit my gestational diabetic diet: Splenda and Stevia Plus powder in place of sugar, and all whole wheat flour. Normally I only subs. 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat, but these were so moist that going all out didn't seem to make a big difference. Amazing- and now my new favorite. :)",,

282672,2509,2008-11-11,4,"I made several modifications.

I used one large can of pumpkin instead of a small one and a cup of applesauce.

I substituted 3/4 cup Splenda brown sugar blend for the 1 1/2 cups white sugar.

I used 2 cups white flour and one cup whole wheat instead of 3 cups white flour.

I used a cup of chopped pecans instead of chocolate chips.

I also added some nutmeg, cloves and vanilla in addition to the cinnamon.

I made a dozen large muffins, a pan of ""gems"" (mini muffins), and I scooped out the last six dollops (about 2 tablespoons each) onto a cookie sheet - these became ""pumpkin-pecan scones.""  People liked 'em!

I use a combination of whole wheat flour, flax meal and oatmeal for the flour and a combo of mashed bananas and maybe only 1 tbps of canola oil.  I add blueberries, walnuts and a small amount of chocolate.  Sometimes I also add shredded zucchini.  My kids, husband and all of our friends love these!  Fail proof!",,

Honestly, I was torn between whether I should make these (the healthier version) or the originals...but I'm very glad I went for these because I honestly couldn't tell that they were made to be on the healthier side.  I halved the recipe and the yield was 16 muffins filled approximately 1/2-3/4 full.  Bake time for my oven was about 18 minutes.  Very easy and quick to throw together with good results and a nice flavor.  My 3 year old had two of them already this morning.

I use half whole wheat flour for the flour and cut the sugar to 1 cup.
I used Recipe #78579 for nonstick coating and it works like a dream.  I used the rubber muffin pans and cooked 6 in the microwave for 3 minutes.

I would recommend adding 1/2 the oil recommended and grease the inside of the papers. I like more spice, so i add nutmeg. Try substituting Butterscotch chips for an Extra yummy treat!!! I also do agree about the amount of choc chips- although i love chocolate- it does overpower the pumpkin flavor a bit, so for a more ""grown-up"" fall flavor, I would suggest halving the choc chips.

Like other's suggested, I added a little oil with the apple sauce (about 1 tbsp).  I used cinnamon apple sauce & also added in about 1 tsp extra.  I added a little nutmeg and allspice as well.  About 1 tsp. vanilla flavor and 1 tsp. butter flavoring were added-it's what I had on hand.  Like others said, I only added 6 oz. of chocolate chips-i think any more would have overpowered the flavors of the pumpkin.  Oh, and I mashed up half a banana and mixed it in as well...   I experimented with this one and it really paid off.  Please guys...feel free to play around with this recipe-it is super versatile!",,
2361867,2509,2012-08-12,5,"I love this recipe, It is so easy and delicious! <br/>I also add one teaspoon of nutmeg as I find it gives it more flavour.<br/>The first time I used this recipe I used white chocolate buttons as that was all I had and it really was good, almost better then brown chocolate.<br/>For cooks outside of the US or where canned pumpkin is unavailable  I have used 1cup of crown pumpkin and one cup of butternut pumpkin diced and heated in the microwave and then stick blended, if you cant find butternut try 1 1/2 cups of crown and 1/2 a cup of kumara or sweet potato. Always cook the veges in the microwave or oven rather then boiling them as the extra moisture will give you a (unwanted) thinner puree",,
1052873,2509,2012-11-21,5,Just as good as the full fat version. Made in Wilton silicon cups - made 28. 400 degrees 16 minutes. Mini chips would be better but all I had was the big ones.,,

I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, a few good shakes of cloves, and at least 2 tsps vanilla to the double batch. Thank you - I&#039;ll make these again!",,

I substituted 3 Tbsp. of wheat bran (for a bit of a fiber boost) for 3 Tbsp. of flour. I used my own canned pumpkin and weighed it out on a kitchen scale. Added 1 tsp. of vanilla since I canned my pumpkin without any spices.  I made a half recipe so I put all the liquid ingredients in the food processor with the pumpkin chunks. It worked out beautifully. Give this recipe a try. It is simple and will make everyone hungry just smelling it cook. Jim in So. Calif.,,

I'd advise that you make sure your baking powder is not old (like mine most likely was) before baking this bread. In addition, even with extra spice added, the bread was not as spice intense as I'd hoped. After a day of trying to let flavors meld deeper it was still not as flavorful as I like it. However, it was still good! Thanks for posting.",,
745545,2510,2009-09-14,5,I made the low fat version with applesauce and less sugar - and the bread came out fantastic. I made a full size loaf and a dozen muffins (the muffins I baked for about 22 minutes) They turned out extremely moist and very tasty.,,

166294,2510,2009-10-20,5,SO yummy!  I also made 12 muffins and 1 loaf of bread.  I had planned on freezing the loaf but the family went through 8 muffins at dinner so I think I better keep the loaf out for breakfasts and snacks tomorrow!  :),,

I would give it 10 stars if i could. only other change i did was to add chocolate chips for my husband :-),,
45512,2510,2009-10-28,5,I substituted non-fat plain yogurt for the oil and it came out perfect-very moist. I also doubled the cinnamon but left the other spices as written and it was perfect for our tastes. So good when still warm from the oven!,,

793472,2510,2009-11-18,5,"YUM, YUM, YUM!  This is fantastic.  I made the bread, but I also made mini-muffins from the recipe (cooked in about 12 minutes).",,
635744,2510,2009-11-22,5,"This was great - I reduced the cloves as I'm not too fond of them, added 1/4 tsp ground star anise, and a package of Nestle chocolate chips.

Put 1 scant cup brown sugar and 1 scant cup white sugar, used the 'alternatives', doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup oats instead of the last cup of flour, all of which was whole wheat.

But the kicker was when I forgot to add the eggs and baked them into muffins, and they still turned out delicious! A little dense, but I certainly surprised myself!",,
708032,2510,2009-12-01,5,I did exactly what the recipe called for and it turned out AMAZING!  It's great for a sweet tooth or for breakfast.  It's so moist and delicious. Best pumpkin spice bread EVER!,,

Our kiddos are disgustingly healthy (thank God!), so I don't worry about the cup of oil...we don't make it every week, and olive oil works perfectly well. <br/>I do make these changes: I use half regular flour and half white whole wheat flour. It adds a mice nutty texture, and some health benefits. I also tend to bake it in a 9x13 pan, since I have bad luck getting it fully bakes in loaf pans. <br/>Our recipe calls for 2/3 cup water. I'll try cutting it to see if loaf pan baking works better- so thanks for that! :)<br/>This bread is quick and easy to make, and sooo delicious!

I've made this recipe several times and this is what I do:  I use 1 1/2 c sugar, add a bit of vanilla to the pumpkin mixture, and in addition to the spices listed in the recipe, I add 1 (heaping) teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  This gives it a bit more flavor and a little ginger, too.  And, I find that 60 min is too long--50 minutes and then letting it sit in the pans for another half hour seems to work with my crazy oven.<br/><br/>I also add a pkg of milk choc chips and it's so delicious!",,
498451,2510,2012-09-16,4,"I used this recipe to make little pumpkin ""muffins"". You'll need about 3 muffin pans if you plan to do it that way, and they get a bit more of a ""crust"" if you don't put them in the little cupcake liners, which IMO adds a bit of extra depth to the overall taste/texture of the muffins.<br/><br/>While we like the recipe ""as-is"", I'd definitely make some changes. I think I'd add a tad more spice, as it seems rather bland, although, some of this is cured after it fully cools and has time to sit--no eating them warm from the oven!<br/><br/>Also, I don't know if anyone else noticed, but mine are a bit sticky to the touch even after being baked...I'm debating on adding a touch more flour next time to help reduce that so that they store a bit better. I also definitely plan to make the the healthier way next time, because I'd bet that really adds to the texture of the bread.<br/><br/>Thanks for the recipe Marg!!!

My first attempt at this receipe was ok but not completely successful, never the less the taste was what I remembered and that earns it a five.  Be sure to use THIN cuts of boneless chicken so it fries up crisp.  Too thick a piece makes the coating soggy and therefore less edible.  This sauce will work best with rendered chicken fat.

I used to order this every week at my local Chinese restaurant, and still do whenever I visit Michigan.<br/>This recipe is good. The sauce is right on but the batter is wrong. First of all, forget the baking powder. Instead of using water, try clubsoda. It will give your chicken a crispier tempura like texture.Make sure the batter is on the thin side so that it dredges off easily. Use peanut oil or don't make this dish! Regular veg or corn oil cannot get hot enough to really crisp the chicken without setting off smoke alarms!<br/>Also, the sauce does require 1/4 teaspoon of real Almond Extract to give it the authentic restaurant flavor we Michiganders know and love. Forget the mushrooms. They just water down the gravy. Use Iceberg Lettuce. It is the coldest, crunchiest to offset the warmth of the chicken and gravy.<br/>I know this works because I experimented with this recipe until it was just like my favorite Chinese haunts in suburban Detroit.<br/>Also, change out the chicken for duck and make it Wor Su Opp!",,

I actually used half olive oil and half rice bran oil for the oil and the olive oil added a really nice flavor as well.  I think that this might be nice with some spicing added as well- maybe some basil or italian seasoning or onion or even cheese or whatever.  I think  some sunflower seeds would be really nice.  Really lovely as-is.  I did find that the texture was pretty crumbly and it did not slice very well.  The batter seemed a little thin to me, and I wonder if maybe it would be better with the milk reduced slightly (say to 3/4 cup?).  I may try this again with the reduced quantity of milk and report back.  Certainly not a bad recipe by any stretch, though!  Really great flavor, and absolutely delicious hot out of the oven.

416292,2537,2008-07-14,4,"I thought there was way too much cinammon so I knocked it down to a tablespoon and still thought the flavor was overpowering. Didn't have a whole lot of time so I bought refrigerated pie crust (kind that's rolled, NOT frozen) Didn't add the lemon either. Pie would have been 5 stars and EXCELLENT if it wasn't for the mucho cinnamon taste.",,

We came home to a house that smelled fabulous and a gorgeous looking apple pie complete with lattice top which tasted as good as it looked.  Very juicy and with a tender crust.  He wasn't sure about the lemon zest so used a mix of lemon zest & juice.",,

They just never turn out right but this recipe is a winner.  So easy and the pie was just oozing of flavor!!  My family loved it and all gave it 5 stars.",,
349750,2537,2008-09-27,5,"Thanks you! This is an awesome recipe! The seasoning is just perfect. I have never made an apple pie before, but I will be again. This was just delicious!
Oh, and if no ice cream is handy, fine shredded colby or cheddar is yummy!",,
586301,2537,2008-09-28,4,Very good pie!  I like that it is very moist and very easy to make.  There is no dimension for the pie pan provided so the apples were overflowing (luckily they cooked down).,,

So easy to make and a great recipe for rookie pie makers, like myself. Thanks for posting!",,
835632,2537,2008-10-16,5,This is a HUGE hit!  I used this recipe for the apple filling in several pies that I made over our Canadian Thanksgiving week and have had the recipe requested numerous times!  I adjusted the cinnamon to just 1 tbsp and didn't have lemon zest so left it out and everything was delicious!,,
873277,2537,2008-10-19,5,"The best apple pie we've ever had!! The only change we made was slightly cutting back the cinnamon and lemon zest. However, the lemon zest made this recipe amazing... making the flavor of the apples very complex. This will be our recipe of choice from now on.

626503,2537,2008-10-26,5,"this pie is AMAZING! Just made it for my b/f as he is an apple pie fan!! he is on his third slice and jumping around the kitchen.  I added rasins, and only 3/4 cups of sugar and 3/4 tablespoons of cinnamon...YUMMY thanks Dancer^!!!!!  This pie RULES! :)",,
343958,2537,2008-10-26,4,"This is the first time I've made an apple pie before.
Like other reviewers I cut the cinnamon down, to 2.5 tsp, I used some lemon juice not zest since we don't care for it.  The crust came out well, but my rolling job wasn't the best.  It smelled wonderful, next time I'm going to put sugar on the crust.  I dont know if it was the types (used a variety) of apples but it came out watery, maybe add more flour next time. This is good and will make it again.",,
245429,2537,2008-11-20,5,"This is our favorite recipe for apple pie.  I usually use store bought pie crusts,I use one for the crust itself and I roll out the other one and make a lattice decoration out of it to lay across the top.  For the pie I use one extra tablespoon of flour, more cinnamon and also more nutmeg.  I also sprinkle lemon juice all over the sliced apple which makes the spices and flour and sugar stick better.  I haven't tried the lemon zest, I figured I had enough lemon flavor with the juice.  Very easy and delicious!!",,
185113,2537,2008-11-28,5,Smashing recipe!  The only change I made was I used a bit less than a tablespoon of cinnamon instead of the full 1.5 tablespoons.  It was a hit for Thanksgiving!  Thanks!,,
721832,2537,2008-11-28,4,I used this for Thanksgiving. I would have given it five stars except that the lemon made the pie more sour than we cared for. However the other flavors were good and I'll definitely try this one again without the lemon. (I'll also try mixing in some sweeter apples. As a new pie baker I'm never quite sure what apples would be best.) Thanks a lot for an excellent recipe!,,

422013,2537,2008-12-11,5,"This was a wonderful pie!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I didn't have nutmeg, so I just left it out, and it turns out, I like it even better without it!  I especially loved the lemon zest...it gave it that something extra.

it's amazing. i messed up horribly with the crust because i kept on not adding enough cold water, and then i added too much cold water **slaps head** BUT IT STILL TURNED OUT GREAT
as the other reviews stated, i turned down the amount of cinnamon
oh, and i left out the lemon just because i forgot",,
534062,2537,2008-12-21,5,The perfect apple pie.  I've made this twice now and got rave reviews both times.  The only change I made to the recipe was removing the butter since we eat kosher-style and need dairy-free desserts.  Even without the butter this was still juicy and delicious.  I use a mandolin to slice the apples very thin which makes a nice texture inside the pie.  Thanks for such a great recipe!,,
202640,2537,2008-12-23,5,We could not believe how wonderful this pie was. I will not have to look for another apple pie recipe again. Perfect every time no matter what apple I choose. Thank You,,
1097235,2537,2009-01-03,5,It was a really good apple pie. I used 3 yellow delicious and 4 granny smiths. When i read the recipe I wondered about the cinnamon it seemed to be a lot so I used only half. I think it was just right.,,

1389601,2537,2009-09-20,5,"This pie was so perfect & delicious!  The crust was the highlight.  It tasted like a sugar cookie :)  To make the pie less runny, I have read that you can add cornstarch.  I have also heard that it is good to stick with Granny Smith's and (Eastern) Golden Delicious apples.  I took everyone's advice and used only 11/2 teaspoons of cinnamon & lemon juice instead of zest.",,
253965,2537,2009-09-26,2,"Good base, but way too much cinnamon for our taste.",,
20064,2537,2009-10-10,5,WOW - What a great recipe. Finally - an apple pie with some flavor. I will be making this again without changing anything.,,
1139501,2537,2009-10-14,4,"The pie turned out really good, there was so much sauce though? Did we do something wrong?  

Caution! This is an extremely sweet pie! If you don't like sweet stuff, lower the sugar content to maybe 2/3 or 1/2 (depends on you). I loved that the pie was so easy to make, the crust is perfect! will use it again in other pies. I also followed the advice of others and used less cinnamon, barely a tablespoon. We also used less lemon zest, less than 1/4 teaspoon because others had stated that this pie could get kind of bitter! It was perfect! We also only used five apples, they were big though! We used granny smiths and golden delicious! Perfect with a hint of tartnes and sweetness.  

Can someone explain why my apple pie has so much sauce? It was overfilling and extremely sweet!",,
66448,2537,2009-10-19,5,"This is just about the same recipe I use. I bought 7 Granny Smith apples for the pie & followed the recipe except for the lemon zest, I felt it didn't need it. I added a tiny bit more flour as it was quite soupy, I love cinnamon so I added the whole amount. Very good pie, we had it while it was still barely warm the some vanilla custard ice-cream on it, ummmmm!",,

5060,2537,2009-11-02,5,"Made for DH's birthday, apple pie instead of a cake he wished and was very pleased with this one!!  I used splenda instead of sugar and just used a half cup, also cut back on the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon and  used becel marg for the butter.  The pastry was fine, i used shortening, it made enough to fit easily in a 9 inch aluminum pie plate.  The only problem I had was that my apples were so juicey that when i took it out of the oven it was sitting in juice, so I quickly, while it was hot slipped it onto a plate, surprizingly it landed in one piece!!  It did stick to the plate but did come away ok to lift with a wide spatula.  It was delicious topped with a slice of cheddar cheese.  thanks for posting.",,
1326703,2537,2009-11-02,5,"I used a mix of Gala and Granny Smith, they didn't turn out how I liked so I will have to play with the apples and see what suits my taste best, thinking Spartan might be good.   I absolutely loved the flakiness of the crust, it turned out perfect!  Spicing was done extremely well to my likings but if you aren't big on cinnamon I would suggest adding less.  I added a bit of cinnamon sugar to the top crust before baking to add a bit more sweetness.   Thanks for a great recipe.",,
800480,2537,2009-11-16,2,"After reading the reviews I decided to use less cinnamon (reduced to 1 tablespoon). This was still way too much even for cinnamon lovers like us. The apples were ""brown"" from the cinnamon rather than a nice apple color. I think if the cinnamon was reduced to teaspoons instead of tablespoons it would be a great pie but for our tastes, I think I'll keep searching.",,
1456044,2537,2009-11-21,5,"This was sooo good!! I but the exact ingredients in it and it was awesome!! Best apple pie ever.  I have also never made an apple pie before.

After reading the review, I decided to reduce the cinnamon and sugar by half. Skip the lemon zest. Drain the excess liquid from the ingredient after mixing them up.  

Serve the apple pie last evening at a Christmas gathering. Little did I expect it was the men who love it. One of them asked me for the recipe so that his wife could bake it for him, the other friend wanted nothing to be brought home except the apple pie... Thank you Dancer for this wonderful recipe. I'm gonna bake this for many more occasions.",,

I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, as I had read reviews declaring the pie too-cinnamony, and I left out the lemon zest.  I have used this recipe twice, so far, one time using gluten-free flour.

Did use the lemon zest, but was careful not to over do.  My pie ranked right up there with the chocolate Easter Bunnies that were running amok at my daughter's.  Thanks, Dancer^, for this wonderful recipe.",,
1247315,2537,2010-06-03,5,"To start I should say I've never made a sweet pie before without using store-bought crusts.  This recipe is not only easy but also delicious!  The crust is super easy to make (used about 3 1/2tbsp of water) and turned out VERY tender and flaky.  The only changes I made was to use 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar, 1/3c regular shortening and 1/3c butter shortening (not actual butter, you can find this at any grocery store).  Other than that I used just 1tbsp of cinnamon and instead of the zest I used about 1tsp of lemon juice.  Thanks a mil for this recipe, it's a keeper :).",,

I've have never made an apple pie that worked for me, the crust was always either horribly wrong or the filling would be wrong or SOMETHING would always happen and it turned out awful. THIS one, however, THIS finally made me feel awesome because it turned out AMAZING! I used our own apples we grew, they're very, very tart and firm so they are excellent for baking. Everyone has their own tastes, and for me, this pie was not too sweet at all, but it might be because of the apples I used and because I happen to like sweet stuff. Anyway, the crust is awesome and I can believe how simple it is to make!! Tender and flaky and delicious ^_^ I did go on other reviewer's advice in using just 1 1/2 TSPs of cinnamon, and it turned out fine. Love this, love this, love this!

The pie had the perfect amount of syrupy liquid. Lemon zest was a nice touch. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",,

I also ran just short on maraschino cherries so I used the leftover CANDIED cherries from my Christmas baking and they worked great here!  It's REALLY hard to not eat the entire batch!!!

844160,2561,2008-05-26,5,EXCELLENT!  I doubled the fruit and marshamallos (BIG FAMILY) and used the 8 ounces sour cream and 8 ounces of cool whip.  Also added a cup of coconut.  LOVED IT!!!,,

125325,2574,2006-03-16,5,This is now one of my family's favorite dishes. I followed the recipe except I used 3 anchovies. Served with orzo and we ate til we couldn't breathe. LOL.. Thanks!,,
72254,2574,2007-03-10,5,"I've made this several times since I first rated this. Always having used either venison (once having used lamb). I forgot to mention that I did substitute white wine with red table wine, when using wild meat. Makes for really rich juice. As I've mentioned before, this is simply delicious. Easy to make. Even if you have a busy day planned. Put it all together in the morning. Cover and let it braise on low heat for several hours, while your doing shopping or whatever errands etc, then come home pop some rice in the steamer, then you have a very nice dinner in no time.  This particularly works well with venison or any wild meat, as it tenderizes the meat really well and turns out moist instead of dry, like wild game tends to be at times.
This is a good recipe to impress friends with, too.  The name itself is exotic sounding (We're having, ""Osso Bucco"" tonight.  Oooh? Sounds interesting. What is it? Here. Let me plate you up some:-) and the flavors are like no other, with very little effort involved. And most of the ingredients, people who love to cook from scratch, would already  have on hand.

2001367790,2583,2017-01-27,5,"Thank you thank you. I lost my Camellia Grill card and I've been trying to find the real recipe for a while. After I moved to New Orleans their pie was worth the wait for a seat :) And it was the closest pecan pie to the one my grandmother used to make. Not sure why people have mixed results - it's like making a custard pie so timing can vary in the cooking for many reasons. Just check for doneness and give yourself an extra 30 min in case it takes longer. Plus it's better when it is not right out of the oven. BTW at the Grill they would put it on the grill before serving to both warm it and also it makes sure there's no soft crust. Using real butter, real vanilla extract, dark instead of light brown sugar, and free range eggs if you can find (they are darker colored and add more richness). Also my grandma used half light Karo and half dark just to make it more flavorful. (I grew up thinking there was a nut called &quot;karo&quot; since she called this Karo Nut Pie!) My oven is futzy so I usually put a foil rim over the exposed crust toward the end of baking time. And like others posted, personally I prefer to dump the pecans in first and pour mixture over. I am transplanted to California and I noticed the pecans we get here (not local) seem more dry than the ones I would buy in the south. That might cause issues if you are putting the pecans on top if they don't have enough oil in them then they could possibly burn a bit. If that's the case just put them in before the filling and let them rise throughout the cooking - they will be more protected and also glazed at the end.",,

I baked mine in three bread tins -- the two tins with two inches of batter for an extra ten minutes. These latter two browned very nicely in the extra time.",,

and omitted the cornflakes (only because I didn't have any on hand).  Instead of the lemon 
drizzle icing, I used a pastry bag to pipe melted chocolate in stripes across the cookie & 
a big rosette in the middle to stick a whole peanut on top.

But be warned, it is possible to blend the dressing too long so it emulsifies into a gelatinous goop, something like mayonnaise.  Guess who did that one?  The first time I made it, i wanted to use the blender to chop up the onion ... oops!  Now I still put a chunk of onion in the blender with the vinegar, but hold the rest of the ingredients until the onion is pretty much pulverized.",,

30382,2625,2008-03-23,5,Very good and easy too.  Added 1/4 t. of salt and used grated parmesan instead of mozzarella.  The dressing is best added to salad as soon as you mix it.,,
141284,2625,2009-09-15,5,"Delish! had it pretty much as is, though the bacon I had had gone sour, so we didn't have it. I reduced the sugar in the dressing, and added a little salt. Will make again!",,
341513,2625,2010-06-27,4,"I made this without bacon. I feel that there was way too much mozzarella cheese. The dressing recipe can be halved given the amount of salad this recipe has as well. May just be a preference, but using it all would've been WAY heavy. Thanks for posting!",,

I was a little worried because the dressing smelled a little overpowering and I really didn't think I would like it but it tasted really good on this salad. My husband was really leary but he loved this also. I don't think it needs the cheese so I will skip that next time. I also used the ready made bacon because I really don't like cooking bacon.

this with many comments about scaleded fingers as she took it out of the pan.  She 
also made the same dough and rolled it out and added rashers (bacon) parsley and

Anyway, there are a few problems with the ingredients and directions.  Even though the salt, pepper, parsley (1 tablespoon dry) and garlic (I used 2 cloves) they still should be listed on the ingredient list.  It says to preheat oven but does not say to what.  I set the oven to 350 baked 40 minutes and the turned it up to 375 for another 15 minutes.  I did like the moist bread in the peppers.  You need to cover this as it bakes as the stuffing top gets a little dry.  We added the salt and pepper at the table to each our own taste.  Still I would make this again with the changes I stated.

One thing...I wondered what the 'orange' was for as it lists 'one orange' in the ingredients, but its not mentioned in the instructions!  I omitted it and used the entire zest and juice of a honey tangerine...it worked just fine, and tasted delicious.",,

I put a pan directly under the chicken to do indirect cooking in my gas BBQ and kept the pan filled with water.

I put half an onion in the neck to help keep the steam in. Next time I will use a rub and try putting some herbs in the beer can. By the way, I hate the taste of beer but the beer flavor cooks away and you end up with moist flavorful meat. I used hickory wood chunks and the meat had a wonderful smoky flavor.

She added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce to make it a bit more saucy and then, as her standby in her goulash, added 2 slices of cheese (Velveeta).  Oh, and I noticed she put in a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chilis in place of the canned whole tomatoes.  A very nice hint of a kick.  HOLY MAMA it is the best sauce I've ever had by far.

704950,2659,2009-04-13,5,"How can anything with Italian sausage in it be bad???  This is great-tasting and easy to make! I cooked this in my dutch oven instead of a saucepan.  I used 3 (instead of the 1 1/2) cups of chopped celery and made sure that I used the hearts then the rest of the stalks.  I think that this type of stew or dish is best when you layer the seasonings so I really sort of sprinkled the salt and pepper and other seasonings each time I added vegetables instead of putting the salt (especially) and other seasonings in all at once.  Also, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I used 1 red bell pepper and 1 green and I thinly sliced my zucchini on a mandoline.  Used 12 oz fresh cherry tomatoes, halved and 2 cans of fire-roasted tomatoes slightly drained.  Finally, I reversed the order that I put the peppers and zucchini into the dish.  I added the peppers after the celery had cooked down a bit because I thought they needed more cooking time than the zucchini then the zucchini was my last vegetable that I added. Served with a little orzo pasta. We really enjoyed this Italian dish, thanks for the recipe Pipman!!!!",,

541453,2662,2007-09-05,4,"Great recipe, tastes awesome...I made, what I think, are a few improvements:  frying the tortillas in olive oil(they just weren't the same when placed in the oven as recommended), and heating the tuna mixture so they were WARM.  Otherwise, this recipe puts another face on tuna out of the can.=)",,

I would absolutely never leave out the chilies. The combination of these flavors was absolutely great. I tried spraying one tortilla with Pam butter flavored and I brushed the other with melted butter before baking. Both turned out wonderfully, so I will stick with the 0 calorie Pam.",,
526411,2662,2010-08-02,3,"I love tuna fish sandwiches so I thought I would try this.  I didn't add the chilies because we don't like them.  I tried putting the shells in the oven and also I tried frying some in the skillet with Pam.  I felt that the oven was the best way. I halved the amount of sour cream because I thought it was too runny.  I also added cheese in the mix to thicken it up some, plus I added some salt and mustard to give it more flavor.  I think I would have liked it better made with mayo instead of sour cream so it would have had more zing.  My review might not even be fair because we didn't use the chilies, so keep that in mind when reading this.  The chilies would have given it much more flavor.  I made this for the Cookbook Tag game.",,

90295,2663,2007-08-26,5,"Absolutely delicious! This soup was just what I was looking for, Carole.  It contains two ingredients I'm fond of, but wouldn't have thought of putting together: lentils and bulgur.  It also allowed me to use up some fresh spinach and parsley that I didn't want to go to waste, as we're going out of town in a few days. I had everything I needed, except the beef broth; so I substituted beef flavored ""Better Than Bouillon"" for it. Your directions mention garlic, but it's not listed with the ingredients.  I put in 1 tsp. of minced garlic.  I always keep a jar of it in the refrigerator. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.  I will be making it often.",,
179721,2663,2007-11-08,5,My husband is very picky about soup and says this is possibly the best soup he has ever eaten!  It was wonderful.  I had to substitute vegetable broth for beef broth as my daughter is a strict vegetarian and found the lentils were tender after only simmering for about 15 minutes.  Also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic.,,

I made this vegetarian for my daugther & me and had my non lentil/onion/veggie/soup eating hubby try it.  He came back ""don't tell me what's in it, just give me another bowl!""  My dad who hates lentils, bowl and a half!  I made as written except used canned chopped tomatoes, dried parsley and veggie broth instead of beef.  This will be a repeat soup in my house.  I will post a photo tomarrow when I reheat for lunch!  Thanks Carole!!",,
130219,2663,2008-03-01,5,"Thought I would try this soup since I had all ingredients on hand to make it and ...... boy, am I glad I did! Wonderful flavor, different from the lentil soup I'm used to. The addition of spinach and bulgur really ""bulk up"" this soup. Filling, nutritious and very easy to make. You didn't specify  the amount of garlic so I used 3 fat cloves sliced very thin. The soup has an odd aroma (must be the bulgur) but you forget all about that once you taste it. So much fun finding a tasty new way to fix an old stand by (lentils). Thanks for posting Carole.",,
526269,2663,2008-05-09,5,"I had spinach and I don't like it raw.  I wanted to make a soup and had no white beans...I did have lentils.  
So I made this not at all excited.  
But, I should have been.
The soup was delicious.  It does need to  be salted heavily though.  My kids looked at it and said they wouldn't eat it so they were allowed to dip their bread in it and all of them decided to eat it.  the most exciting part is I made the soup yesterday and had the leftovers today...and they were even better.  The tastes all became so deep with the rosemary.  I did make this with chicken broth but since there are so many flavors I thought the broth taste would get lost.  Super recipe, doesn't take much time and a beautiful soup.",,

We had to substitute vegetable broth, wild rice for bulgur and no tomatoe paste due to our ""21 day cleanse"" requirements - BF added crushed red peppers - turned out perfect!

377070,2663,2010-04-12,5,Very tasty recipe with a wonderful aroma. I used Better than Bouillon vegetable broth (used almost 8 cups total and let simmer longer at the end) and swapped the bulgar for barley. Used 3 cloves of minced garlic and added a generous 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. Will definitely be making this again and again!,,

Next time I might add some lamb and will also garnish with a good yogurt. It's a keeper...thanks for posting.",,

Everyone I&#039;ve ever served it to has raved about it. One time I made it with buckwheat groats instead of bulgur because that&#039;s what I had. Not as good, but still tasty!

425242,2677,2009-08-15,5,So good...sometimes I don't even do the first rise.  I just fold them straight into biscuits and let them rise once before baking.,,
168462,2677,2009-08-16,5,These were almost too easy to make. The dough was very easy to work with and my family loved them. Next time I may add an extra tablespoon of sugar as we do like our biscuits a bit on the sweet side. Thanks for the recipe.,,
1328942,2677,2009-09-23,5,"I made baked about 20 of these tonight and there's only 3 left...haha! They were soo good. I didn't have regular milk so I used Almond Milk and it worked just fine. I think next time I'll roll them out to 1"" because I rolled them to about 1/4"" and it wasn't that tall/big, if that makes sense. They were flatter than normal biscuits. So, I think it'd be nice to state how thick to roll out otherwise newbies such as myself won't know otherwise. Overall, thanks for sharing the recipe. It's fantastic! I'll definitely be making these again.",,

Btw, another key to get it to rise big is to knead it VERY lightly and not overdo it. I got the tip from Alton Brown's biscuit episode. It works wonderfully!",,

125808,2677,2010-02-06,5,"At last!  No more will I bother trying to make biscuits with biscuit mix, which turns out dry crumbly rocks.  These are so easy to put together, easy to cut out and handle, and taste amazing.  I used butter because I didn't have any shortening on hand, and then brushed the tops with a little butter mixed with garlic powder and parmesan before baking, since I was serving them with spaghetti.  DD2 took one bite and said ""MMMMMMMM!!!!""  Will definitely be making these again SOON!  Thanks!",,

I used butter and as recommended, left sit out on the counter overnight covered by a towel.  Made the mistake of rolling some of the dough too thin, from now on, will roll about 3/4 inch thick, because we like tall, flakey biscuits. I am going to try freezing some pre-cut dough so I can take out a few, let thaw and then cook as needed. Hopefully that should turn out really good too.",,

1861496,2677,2011-03-21,5,"These are, without a doubt, the absolute best biscuits I have ever had! I don't use shortening (hydrogenated fat is evil), so I used butter. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used kefir. After cutting out the biscuits, I cut the remaining dough scraps into 1/4"" pieces and tossed them into a pot of chicken soup. They made excellent dumplings.",,
178427,2677,2011-12-29,5,Wonderful! These were easy to make and tasted great. I used butter and the milk/vinegar option. I got 16 large fluffy biscuits that baked up perfectly. Thanks for sharing.,,

It is a very shaggy dough, but with the addition of about 1/3 cup flour while kneading, it became perfectly soft and pliable. The biscuits were soft and tender.

2286089,2677,2014-06-01,5,"I just made these today.........AND, I used my bread machine.  They came out perfect.......golden, fluffy and delicious.   I used half the amount of salt called for and didn&#039;t have shortening so I used unsalted butter slightly softened......  I set the machine on the dough setting and took out at the 50 minute mark right before the second rise........rolled the dough, cut them out, let rise for 30 minutes, brushed the tops with melted butter, baked for the 12 minutes and brushed the tops with melted butter again when they came out of the oven ........DELISH!!!!!!!!!!!

2001548430,2677,2017-05-21,5,"SO EASY TO VEGANIZE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used 1 cup soy milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar in lieu of the buttermilk and they were SO FLUFFY AND tasty!! Sometimes texture comes at the cost of taste, but these have BOTH the desired texture and taste. I was also making sweet potato fries so I allowed the dough to rise for about 2 hours the first time and then probably an hour after being cut. I always heat my oven to 40 degrees above the cooking temperature and then turn it to the baking temperature when I insert the baked goods because an oven will lose 30-40 degrees when we open the oven. So I do not know how any of these impacted the biscuits but these knocked the socks off my family and will now be the cholesterol free family favorite!! Thanks for sharing!",,

327281,2678,2007-06-26,4,"We enjoyed these.  They were very light and quite fresh-tasting.  The dough was very fragile, so I shaped it into a square and cut it into nine little squares (easier than cutting rounds and reshaping).  The scones didn't rise quite as much as I expected (but still fine), and I had to cook them for 15 minutes.  Useful recipe, and one I will make again.",,
570804,2678,2007-10-06,3,"I  make similar biscuits to these but I add about 1/4 tsp. baking soda.   This helps them rise a little more.  They are healthy, but a little flat without extra leavening. Haifax Liz",,

My father wanted an alternative Christmas dinner compared to the traditional turkey/ham of the states....thus began the tradition of standing rib and yorkshire pudding.  Since then I've had a difficult time finding a recipe that works as well as the one my mother followed.  This one even got British approval from a friend from England.

I made my fritters with fresh curry leaves, parsley, and mint as the herbs. Suggest using more oil than 1 tbsp, though, especially for subsequent batches -- it's easy to burn the fritters a little if you're not careful, but if you turn too soon, they fall apart.

56061,2684,2007-05-24,5,"We really liked these muffins.  I believe I followed the recipe, but because the measurements are mixed between weights and measures, it's a bit difficult to tell.  I weighed out the cornmeal and found it to be a bit more than 1/3 cup, almost 1/2 cup.  I felt like this needed more corn flavor, so I would probably go with the 1/2 cup.  The apples amounted to about 2 medium granny smith apples.  I just a little more than 1/2 cup of the cheese.  I found the batter to be very stiff and it worried me, but the result was very moist and very tender.  I felt like they needed a bit more salt, even though I rarely add extra salt to recipes, but I'll probably sprinkle in a 1/2 teaspoon.  I needed an extra 5 minutes to get these baked through and the tops were starting to broach the line between golden and dark brown, but it was okay.  We'll make these often!

Anyway this was something a little different from your ordinary hot pepper jelly. Love the colour using the cranberry juice- I used cran-raspberry as that was what I had. Also added a couple of cloves of garlic when I was processing the peppers, and added a couple of red chili peppers from the garden for added colour. I don't bother putting jellies in a water bath and they sealed just fine. Just remember to rotate the jars as they're cooling to distribute the solids. A lovely addition to my store of preserves- thanks!",,

1222360,2686,2009-07-21,3,"Followed directions but found there was not enough zip (hot pepper) flavor throughout. Was dissappointed because it sure sounded great. I think I would add alot more chopped jalapeno, 1 to 1 1/2 C,  next time. This was very mild jelly.",,

I followed these directions to the letter right down to timing the minutes for boiling and it came out perfect.  I think the flavor will develop more bite as it sits so I'm eager to see that.  After reading other reviewers I did add some of the seeds to the mixture to get that extra bite that my family loves.  Served over cream cheese with crackers on the side and so yummy.  I'm addicted to, but think it'll be even better with age.  If i can find some small jelly jars I think this will be perfect in my gift baskets this year.

I recommend that you use 2 pectins instead of one. It is very runny, not jelly like at all. It will be ok for marinades and mixing with things but to put on toast, crackers or cream cheese it is like water. So try this recipe it really is good just use two pectins and you will love it.",,

My first batch I made exactly to the recipe, everyone loved it and I had to give my first batch away.  Second batch I kicked up the heat with more peppers, but that overpowered the cranberry flavor that makes this so special.  Hotter was not necessarily better.  I will stick to the original recipe but use 2 pectins.",,
1378713,2686,2009-11-27,5,Have to give this a 5 just for the easy part alone. I added 2 pouches of liquid pectin like others recommended and I added extra jalapeno's. Oh and I also added a few drops red food coloring because the juice didn't quite make it red enough. I used Ocean Spray cranberry juice. It looks beautiful. I maybe only used 1 extra jalapeno over half cup so I hope it tastes great as I didn't taste test if while making it.,,

Initially made for Mr 4 yr old who has numerous food intolerances and allergies. As I was checking that it was not too hot for him as he was eating I was blown away by the delicious taste.  I used 375mls Campbells Chicken stock plus the water measurement with 2 tsp of Rapunzel Vegetable Bouillon which doesn't contain any artifical colours or flavours.  I also didn't blend / puree it, just put a potato masher through to sort of break the mixture down a bit, while it still, remained slighly chunky.  Can highly recommend.",,

53859,2692,2004-06-23,0,"Growing up very near the ""Armenian relocation capital of America"", I have had lots of opportunity to eat lavash.  I have never heard of it referred to as a ""cracker"", and it's always been about the texture of a pita and foldable (not to mention much bigger than this bread seems like it would be) when I got it.  However, this might be good if you don't have access to real lavash, or if you just like to bake at home.  I would suggest whole-wheat flour instead of white, though, for a more authentic taste, and you could try leaving off the milk/sesame topping and see if that makes it not so crispy.  (Lavash does not usually come like that.)  Lavash is good for making ""Armenian burritos"" by folding up burrito-style with beans, veggies, and/or meat, or for wrapping around your kafta with some shredded lettuce and fresh squeezed lemon juice or maybe a little bit of tabouleh.  You can also make appetizers by spreading lavash with yogurt cheese or cream cheese, topping with meat and/or veggies, rolling, refrigerating, and slicing into pinwheels.",,

She didn't use sesame seeds, but there's no reason why you shouldn't use them...She made dozens at a time and they lasted quite a long time in a big plastic bag.  Thanks for this recipe!  It brings back alot of memories of my childhood!",,
846050,2692,2008-06-16,0,"Looks great! When I was younger I remember my dad coming home with many bags of it. It was a special treat! I loved to eat it with cream cheese. Ketchupqueen, you are right. It isn't supposed to be like a cracker at all. Everytime I've had it, it's melt-in-your-mouth soft. I'm so glad I found this recipe!",,
23336,2694,2002-07-23,2,"I couldn't find threebe or even what would be a good substitute.  The chicken turned out fine of course but there was nothing special about it.  
The potatoes are a mystery.  I am a relatively new cook anf I followed the instructions exactly.  When I took the potatoes out an hour later I still had  stock and some potatoes that seemed boiled rather than what I was expecting.  I thought they would be flavourfull potatoe wedges with a bit of a crust. But they weren't.",,
128047,2694,2004-08-02,4,"I looked up threebe in my herb books and used half oregano and thyme as a substitute.  Iused boneless skinless chicken breasts (10 in a double recipe) and they baked in about 20 minutes.  I had problems with the potatoes as well.  I did microwave the mixture to start it and basted them every 10 mins or so.  They should have been covered the whole time and cooked in a single layer so they would get more coverage from the liquid.  Using new potatoes cut in half they took around 15 mins. in the oven after 10 in the microwave.  We loved the flavor, using the juice from the potatoes over the top.  We forgot to mix the sour cream and garlic ahead of time so left out that garlic,  If we had had any leftovers they would make great salad.  But between a hungry teenager and lunch today there isn't anything left.  We'll be eating this again soon.",,

101275,2695,2004-09-19,5,I have made this twice now. Once with the lemon jello as I had an extra packet from bought for an earlier recipe and once with orange jello for my son's birthday and both were excellent. Made the yellow cake from scratch (we are not that big on box mixes in India :D) Topped with the jello and the lemon glaze for the lemon cake  and with whipped cream and orange slices for the orange cake.

We are all for making things easy and we are very satisfied using Duncan Hines Supreme Lemon Cake Mix, and we cook it at 350F for 25-30 minutes, using the toothpick caper. We frost it with juice and zest of one lemon, and 1 cup powdered sugar - more if needed. Puncture the cake many time and pour over cake.

I also had an 8-oz. carton of soymilk that was about to expire, so I used that instead of the water, and cut back a bit on the oil.  I had more liquid in there than the recipe called for, so I thought it should have mixed up easily, but it didn't really; I had quite a few ""chunks"" of cake mix left in the batter bowl!  It didn't affect the taste or texture, though; it had a subtle lemon flavor.  I skipped the icing, because I went to the supermarket to buy lemons... and forgot to buy lemons!

His classmates came up to me a few days later when I was there to help with something and told me how much they loved it. One even asked for the recipe for her mom. I'm here today because that son is about to have his 30th birthday and I needed to find a copy of the recipe. So glad it's here and looks exactly like I remember it. Side note though--I tried to decorate the cake a little for his birthday one year. I tinted the glaze with blue food coloring. Big mistake! Blue food coloring on a yellow cake looks green. My poor cake looked like it had mold growing all over it. lol Still tasted good though!",,

 My cake was also a crumb cake! I really think the last part should be deleted or remove the cooled cake from the pan then pour the glaze over the cake. The glaze causes the cake to stick to the pan. To much sugar! This is a very very lemony cake. My opinion would be skip the concentrate and sugar and sprinkle with powdered sugar. If done this way it a good no fat recipe! I hope this review helps. Sorry I can`t give any stars because I know this is an adopted recipe and it does need to be tweeked. Please keep me informed on what you decide to do with the recipe.

One of my complaints is, they were too salty. I would definitely recommend cutting that back to 1/2 tsp. like a traditional chocolate-chip-cookie recipe calls for. Apart for the saltiness, I also found the flavor a little 'bland'. I would like to try adding another tsp. of vanilla or maybe even almond extract.  I didn't have any nuts so I used 1 1/2 cups M&M's. I made them for a meeting the week of Valentine's so they were the red, pink and white combination. I needed to bake mine about 8 1/2 to 9 minutes or they were just too gummy in the center.

391048,2708,2006-12-31,5,Thanks! Great recipe. Very yummy!,,
201972,2708,2007-01-25,4,This was very tasty but we added a few drops of Chilli oil to give it a bit of a kick.,,
176481,2708,2007-01-29,5,"This recipe was easy to do.  5 stars might be a bit much, maybe 4-1/2 would be better.  It lacked a bit of flavor for me.  I'm used to a guacamole with zest.  I didn't use the olives, but did use fresh lime.  I will keep this recipe for the basics, but think next time to use a spicy salsa to kick it up.",,
284695,2708,2007-02-08,5,"Really enjoyed this. Very quick, very simple. I used some red pesto instead of salsa and creme fraiche instead of our cream. Turned out really nice. Black olives are definitely essential to the taste.

Had it with spicy home made sweet potato wedges and some Baklava Salmon (salmon with honey, mustard and walnuts)

Really went down a treat :)",,
365274,2708,2007-04-03,4,I used this recipe last night but felt it needed something so I added a little sugar and chili powder and its great now!  I also added medium salsa which kicked it up a notch!!!  I did not add the black olives though.,,
302283,2708,2007-04-05,5,This was the best guacamole we've ever had!  Thank you for the recipe - we'll be making it again and again!,,
440112,2708,2007-04-05,5,loved it ... yummy!! It's a good thing that we had guests over to share it with us or else me and the hubby would have eaten all of it!!!  MMMMMMMMM,,
348402,2708,2007-04-24,5,"This was my first time making guac...and it was a huge hit at our bbq!!!  I left out the olives (my DH and I don't eat them) and forgot to put in the onion.  I also used ""light"" sour cream as well...and it was still delicious.  I could eat this stuff all day long!!!  Yum.",,
329671,2708,2007-06-13,5,Loved this recipe!  I used cilantro and lime juice and left out the olives.  I used about 1/2 tsp salt for one avocado.  The flavor was perfect with our fajitas.  Thanks!,,
121985,2708,2007-06-20,4,"awesome recipe, i loved the overall flavor and will make this again.  Thank you!",,
513294,2708,2007-06-27,5,I make guacamole all the time and this is the best yet!,,
545483,2708,2007-07-25,5,Great! I left out the olives and added lemon pepper. It was a nice creamy consistency and a hit with the party!,,
333017,2708,2007-08-16,5,Lovely!,,
134289,2708,2007-08-22,5,Yummy!! The only thing I did different is I added roasted garlic to the recipe.  Delicious!!,,
270514,2708,2007-08-28,5,"Woohoo!  Finally found one that I like.  Maybe even too much because I ate the whole thing.  I didn't have black olives, but everything else was perfect.  This will be the only one I make from now on.  Thank!",,
247362,2708,2007-09-01,5,"Without a doubt the best I've ever tried!Ileft out the black olive, used low fat sour cream and dried parsley.Sinfull!!!!!",,
140132,2708,2007-10-31,4,This was good.  DD and I made this for us when we were having tacos for dinner.  I left out the cilantro as DD doesn't care for it otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Thank you for a good guac recipe.....Stephanie,,
545825,2708,2007-11-30,5,"Yet another 5 Star review.  I made it without the cilantro or parsley, for no other reason than you said it might be vile.  I don't want vile guacamole.  :-)",,
674993,2708,2007-12-03,5,Great recipe. I brought it to work and everyone loved it!,,
576448,2708,2007-12-26,5,Wow! I served this for Christmas and everyone asked for the recipe. What a delicious guacamole!,,
229524,2708,2008-02-02,4,"Good basic dip.  Followed the directions, except for the black olives and lemon juice.  Test tasted it and found that the flavor needed to be kicked up a few notches.  I added some chili powder, more onions and tomatoes and more sour cream to give a creamer texture.  I also added some salt.  The flavors really need to blend and the best way to keep the guacamole from turning brown is to add the pit into the dip. You won't need to add the lemon juice or lime juice if you add the pit and then remove it before serving.",,
385999,2708,2008-02-23,5,"I doubled this recipe, I know it will disappear. I made this for our t.v. night at home.  I added some sun dried tomato spread and black olive tapenade.  I divided the lemon and lime juice and balsamic vinegar and used all three.  I didn't put any salt in this at all, don't think I needed it because there was some in the sun dried tomato spread and the olive tapenade.  The flavour of this is really good.  I can't wait until later and scoop it onto my tortilla chip.  Thanks for a great post.",,
148361,2708,2008-03-06,5,"VERY EASY to make. Works great in a large batch also. I tripled the recipe and left out the sour cream and olives because I didn't have them on hand. I also used minced garlic instead of pressed.
I will definately use this recipe again and never again will I buy guacamole!!!",,
454149,2708,2008-04-03,5,"We loved this! I didn't have any black olives and would only have been able to put them on mine anyway. Also I didn't have any fresh cilantro or parsley. I can't find fresh cilantro in my area, so used dried and it worked fine. This was just about the right amount for dinner. Thanks for a great recipe! I will make this again (I have another avocado in the fridge)!",,
431813,2708,2008-05-17,5,Fantastic guacamole recipe!  I doubled the lime juice and added quite a bit more cilantro.  This was devoured!  Thanks maenad!,,
805179,2708,2008-05-18,4,"This was my first time making guac. I added 6 jalapeno slices, finely chopped and a bit more cilantro. I'm going to keep looking for my favorite guac recipe, but this was an good first start.",,
862754,2708,2008-06-15,5,I amalgamated this recipe with another on Zaar by adding 1/8 tsp cumin and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  The result- all time best guac recipe!!,,
867561,2708,2008-06-20,4,I made this last night and I love it!! I didnt use olives but the rest was great!!!,,
289412,2708,2008-06-23,5,"This deserves 10 stars if it could!  My first time making guacamole and it was delish!  I had three med avocados so adjusted the ingredients accordingly, also did not have olives on hand.  Thank you SO much for posting :)",,
577249,2708,2008-07-01,5,SOOOO GOOD!!  I love it!! I didn't add any cilantro (I am one of those people that find it vile)  I added my own home made salsa and this came out delicious.  This is a keeper! The sour cream just makes it so nice and smooth.  Thanks,,
358391,2708,2008-07-03,0,This was very good!! Will make it again. I too left out the cilantro.,,
369047,2708,2008-07-10,4,"Really good.  Very similar to my own recipe but I wanted some measurements to go by.  I didn't add cilantro (find it vile.) or the black olives (also vile.) and instead of the tomato and salsa, I added 2 tbsp of tomatoes with green chilies which gave it a nice heat.  Very tasty, and it yields quite a bit (nice to stretch out those expensive avocados). Thank you!",,
567219,2708,2008-08-21,5,great recipe- free form is the best when it comes to guacamole! We served this in our fajitas and it was delicious!,,
207176,2708,2008-09-08,5,Terrific- Dh and I are loving it.  I left out the salsa and olives.  I used white onion.  I used lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. of salt .  YUM!,,
630287,2708,2008-09-22,5,My fiance and I have made this several times now. This is the best guacamole we have ever had! We will never buy the pre-packaged again. Even our favorite mexican restaraunt doesn't compare to this. Thanks :),,
141590,2708,2008-10-17,5,Made this for a family golf tournament. Omitted the onions as I did not have any on hand. It was a big hit. Made 5 times the amount for 14 & it disappeared quickly before dinner was served. Thank You.,,
426903,2708,2008-10-26,5,"Very good, my new favorite guac. I omitted the cilantro because there are many of my guests that feel it is vile, and I omitted the olives, because I think that might be weird in a guacamole. Otherwise...very tasty. Thanks for posting.",,
978517,2708,2008-11-08,5,Wonderful!! I made ours without the onion and olives bcuz we don't like that here. But it was EXCELLENT! Thank you.,,
240668,2708,2009-01-11,5,"I'm not a fan of guac, but my BF is and he really raved about this guacamole.  I omitted the sour cream.  Glad to know that whenever I have some extra avocado this recipe can put it to good use.  (UPDATE: I am converted.  I love this stuff and it is a must whenever we have tacos.  The canned guac they serve at restaurants is toxic waste by comparison.)",,
884948,2708,2009-02-05,5,"This is fantastic! I would have never thought to add black olives to guacamole, but it really gives it pizazz. The only thing I changed was to substitute sour cream with plain non-fat yogurt for a healthier option.    I also used both lime and lemon juice instead of one or the other.",,
60124,2708,2009-04-20,5,"made this heaps of times, keep forgetting to review! here it is, a review! its brilliant, try it!",,
512205,2708,2009-04-21,5,"This was excellent!
Made it last night with hubby. I love the addition of the sour cream.  We were a little bit more generous with the tomatoe, onion and salsa... it's very hard to do just 1Tablespoon of those items.  Also we used FRESH salsa.  You could smell the yummy freshness of it all! Hubby added a couple dashes of Old Bay and it was tasty!",,
414153,2708,2009-07-30,5,"This is so good, I have made it weekly this summer! The sour cream makes it smooth and the salsa gives it a little zip. I prefer mine with added salt.",,
1107471,2708,2009-08-02,5,"This is an absolutely wonderful recipe.  Even those in my household that don't like guacamole love it!  I make this recipe at least once a week and even doubling it, there are no leftovers.  Yummylicious!",,
232190,2708,2010-02-28,5,"This the best guacamole I've ever made!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  I doubled the recipe, and there was not one little bit left.  Fabulous!  Thank you maenad!",,
312577,2708,2010-03-31,5,"I loved the sour cream.  I followed the chef's advice and let my guacamole be free-form.  I added extra garlic and omitted the black olives, just because I didn't want to open a whole can for a couple of olives.  Great recipe.  I will definitely be buying more avocados for this FANTASTIC recipe.  THANK YOU!!",,
853136,2708,2011-04-05,5,"absolutely delish. love the addition of black olives. i add a touch of sweet chili sauce too, the second time i made this. so versatile!",,
881977,2708,2011-07-14,4,"Didn't make this exactly as written - free-form and all.  It seemed to be a little bland as we made it, but as the avocados we had (the great big huge ones) pretty tasteless, so that probably didn't help.  Next time we'll use a different kind.  I don't care for black olives, so skipped that - but might use green next time.  We used some fresh pico de gallo that we'd made, which was nice.  Also will definitely use some extra garlic.  The sour cream adds a different dimension to it - great for a spread on BLTs or for homemade chips.  Thanks!",,
126440,2708,2011-09-01,4,Very good guacamole.  I didn't have olives but added salsa verde.  Great with our Mexican Cobb Salad.,,
285039,2708,2012-01-30,5,Delicious! I didn't add olives because I am the only in my family that likes them.  Will be making this often!,,
846778,2708,2012-07-14,5,"Awesome recipe! I minced the garlic, instead of pressing and was only estimating quantities, and it was fabulous! I also omitted black olives, just because I don't like them. Really easy and quick, too!",,
383346,2708,2013-07-02,5,This guacamole is so good.  A lot of ingredients but so worth it.  Thanks maenad :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game,,
298447,2708,2015-09-03,5,"Ding Ding Ding Ding..we have a winner folks!  DH loved it (think the sour cream won him over!)  I didn&#039;t have everything on the list, so i subbed mild taco sauce for salsa, left out olives, cilantro because i had none on hand...as well as the onion (cos DH doesn&#039;t like raw onion).  He has already requested I make it again.  Thank you!",,
2001550139,2708,2017-06-04,5,"I've used a similar recipe for a long time, learned it in Albuquerque, but I add about half a can of diced green chiles and leave out the olives.",,
2001684252,2708,2017-08-23,5,This is the best Guacamole I have ever had. I used 3 avocados instead of 1. Here is a way to make it healthier! I used 2 tablespoons of key lime Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Also saved time and used 3 spoons of chunky fresh sweet onion salsa. Added garlic salt and a few drops of concentrated lemon juice. You can alter yogurt/salsa and garlic to your taste. Give this healthy version a try! You won't be disappointed!!!,,
20754,2710,2004-09-08,5,"Well, I have to say this is a definite 5 star here!  Recipe served only 5 because they didn't stop.  Two DD's had 3 sandwiches each and I lost count with DH!  The meat was so moist and tasty!  Definite keeper here, thanks Dancer^",,
86072,2710,2006-05-30,4,"This wasn't a favorite in our house. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but there was just something that didn't work for us! It was a very easy recipe and I thank you for sharing it. Maybe I'll try the basic recipe again and tweak it a bit to make it work for us!! ",,
66321,2712,2004-04-26,5,"Chris and I REALLY loved this recipe. We used the zest of the whole orange, and it wasn't at all overpowering...in fact, it was very subtle, and didn't take away from the true flavor of the fish. Each bite would have these little bursts of orange flavor from the zest, and it was just wonderful!!! We used tilapia filets, and followed the recipe as written. This was incredibly quick and easy to prepare, and baked in 20 minutes. We had this with steamed broccoli and rice, and we couldn't be more pleased...thank you so much for this delicious recipe..we'll be making it many times in the future--this is definitely a 5 star keeper! 
Teresa",,
4470,2712,2005-05-23,0,I cannot award stars as I am not sure what went wrong.  I used frozen sole and I think it had a slight after taste that sometimes frozen fish has. I cut the recipe back to two servings. When the crumbs were mixed with the butter and orange juice they were clumped together (I did measure when I cut back the recipe) i could not sprinkle them I had to spread them with a knife. I love garlic but did not care for the combination with the orange for the sole.  This recipe has received two 5 star reviews so I suspect the problem is not with the recipe but rather this cook. and the chosen fish. Sorry Doreen the recipe did not work for me.,,
198129,2712,2007-02-03,5,"This was very easy and very delicious.. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used store bought UN-seasoned bread crumbs instead. My Husband loved it and so did I! A nice change from the lemon I usually put in my baked fish.  I also seasoned the the breadcrumbs with approx. I tsp kosher salt & fresh ground pepper, and browned the mixture before spreading on the fish. (another poster had mistakenly added the juice to the bread crumbs), and I would like to  stress the part of the recipe that says (POUR JUICE OVER THE FISH AFTER THE BREADCRUMBS) .  What a nice & different surprise this dish was!! Will make again & again",,
56003,2712,2007-09-10,4,Nice different flavor.  Will use again as a change of pace to lemon!,,
955173,2712,2008-11-01,5,Quick & simple. I followed the recipe and used fresh Albacore. I will make this again.  YUM.,,
768828,2713,2011-02-18,5,This was great.  I didn't have tomato juice so used two cups of home frozen tomatos and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I cooked in the crock pot and added some dumplings.  Yum.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.,,
1531249,2713,2012-03-23,5,"This is a very nice, simple soup.  I only put one-third the amount of tomato juice called for, and substituted water for the remaining liquid.  Also, I used veggie crumbles instead of hamburger meat because we try to eat mostly vegetarian meals.",,

30488,2713,2002-02-06,5,"I made this soup and Brenda's ""Homemade Bread"" today for dinner. Both were great. I used homemade tomato juice and it was too tart for my taste so I added a can of tomato soup plus a can of water. That toned down the tartness, but, now it had too much tomato taste. So I added a can of chicken broth. I also put a big clove of garlic through a garlic press and added that too. That did the trick for me. I simmered it for about two and a half hours because I wanted it thicker. Today was a very cold day and it hit the spot.",,
20076,2713,2003-02-25,5,My husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  It was very good.,,

47761,2713,2003-05-11,4,"Made this for dinner last night,  and well . . I had to jazz the flavor up a bit.  It was a little too bland for my family, so I added (to already inclusive 46 ounce V-8 juice) two cups of Spicy Hot V-8, two T. of Pickapeppa sauce and 1/2 cup quick pearl barley.  Next time, I will add an extra 1/2 lb. of hamburger, and 4 potatoes instead of three.  I had made some classic white bread in the bread machine, served it with this soup, and man o'man, was it ever good!!

It was a great supper, and I'll definitely make it again!  Thanks, Bob Ross!!  :-)",,
95057,2713,2004-01-28,5,"Excellent!  I served it with fresh-baked French bread. . .yum.  The only thing I would change next time is (carnivore that I am) I'd probably double the amount of meat.

145960,2713,2006-01-07,5,"I chose to spice this soup up with cayenne, a little montreal steak seasoning, chili powder and crushed chili peppers. Couple of changes: added a cup of chicken broth and only used 2 med potatoes which I thought was plenty.  And, after hearing ""this would be good with mushrooms"" 200 times with other recipes, I automatically included them for my husband - some quartered, some sliced. Cheese is a good topping and I bet sour cream, bacon and green onions would be too. I will definitely be making this again.",,

I added 1 chicken cube and about 2 cups of water, to thin it out.  I was really pleased with the results.  I highly recommend this recipe",,

169166,2713,2007-09-18,4,Very good. I added a few other spices including red pepper flakes and worcestershire. We ate it with nacho chips.

To answer a simple question here, pasteurized juice is fine, you just can not have ""sorbates"" in the ingredients, it's what cheap companies put in juices to prevent further fermentation, which makes making further fermentation nearly impossible.

283390,2724,2006-08-02,5,"I really enjoyed this sauce. It is basically pesto sauce with spinach and pecans instead of basil and pine nuts, and the substitutions were nice. Thanks for the recipe!",,
59064,2725,2003-04-22,4,Very quick [about 15 minutes all up]. I used basil for my herbs and quite enjoyed this. It definitely needs the salt and I omitted the cayenne because I was out. My toddler was happy to try this too.,,
585430,2725,2007-11-02,4,"So yummy!  I ended up adding another cup of cornmeal, because I wanted it a bit thicker, and I subbed Silk Soy Creamer for the whipping cream.  It was delicious!  I used it to stuff acorn squash. :D

Oh, and it makes a big batch.",,
31803,2726,2002-03-22,4,"The texture was great, but I think I added too much lemon juice. It was a bit too tangy/bitter. Otherwise it was very easy to make in my food processor.

157102,2727,2005-05-14,5,"Mmm...this was so good! The cake is soft, spicy, and just sweet enough. I love that it has no sugar, since I used 100% fruit raspberry preserves. Instead of sandwiching the jam layer between the cake layers, I just heated the preserves a little bit in the microwave (so as to make them more ""spreadable"") and drizzled them over all the batter. Next time I think I'll do the sandwich thing and use half whole wheat flour. Thank you for a great breakfast treat! Even my whole wheat coffee cake recipe has sugar in it, but this doesn't. :-) I'll definitely be making this again.",,

I substituted ground turkey (thanks Norm!)and it was great. I used a 32 oz can of enchilada sauce mild and a 8oz can of tomato sauce. Next time I will use a bigger can of tomato sauce like 16oz plus. I subbed in sharp for mild cheddar inside and used a Mexican cheese mix for the topping (Asiago, Cheddar, Jack and another Mexican cheese -See Kraft's 2 cup Mexican cheese package).

My Dad is German from the Alsace region, and my mother was French from the Alsace/Lorraine region. The recipe was passed from my fathers side.We always made them with ground beef and pork with the parsely and egg, but added chopped onion and celery to meat paste. then we spread the meatpaste onto the dough and made pinwheels and cut them and dropped them into simmering/just below boiling broth, of beef broth with canned tomatoes and celery, onion , and garlic. Like the recipe says, you eat them with broth the first day, then the second day, you fry onions and pour the onions over them, and serve them with German mustard. Just remember... roll the dough fairly thin , otherwise they are really ""doughy"" and loose the balance of meat with dough in broth. We also made a vegetarian version with a spinach paste and boiled in tomatoe broth and it was wonderful. Either way, the original or vegetarian, is sooooo good , everyone should try to make them at least once!",,

They didn't want to eat grape jelly any more afterward. So of course I had to make it again this year, but I tried something new.  After rinsing the berries, I ran them through my juicer (without cooking them).  I then followed the recipe using the three cups of juice. I was told by a county extension agent that I would still have to strain the juice through a jelly bag.  I did for part of the batches, but got lazy for the rest and used the juice straight from the juicer.  They both set up perfectly and I couldn't tell the difference in taste.  I put some in pint jars. Those jars took about two weeks to completely set up. The smaller jars set up more quickly.  The bottle of liquid pectin is equal to two pouches if you buy it that way.",,

Next time I would use the smallest mushrooms I could find, or add a few more, but we're mushroom fiends.  I did do a variation though.  We just bought some fresh sourdough bread, so I made it open face sandwich style.  The sourdough went great with the gravy.",,

I would still recommend this recipe.",,

I omited the ketchup and used white wine since I didn't have any sherry.  Delicious gravy! I made this in my crock-pot and added a few peeled carrots toward the end.  I served it over mashed potatoes. Thank you, Julesong, for a great dinner!",,

I think the sherry really tipped the scales toward fabulous, thanks for posting a real keeper I will be making again.

418366,2772,2008-07-07,5,A great way to fix pot roast!   The gravy was everything you said it was.   I added about 1/2 of a 14 oz can of beef broth to give it more liquid to simmer in.  this made plenty of broth for gravy.  We'll be making this again.,,
1036199,2772,2008-11-21,5,"Absolutely delicious and great for the whole family! The meat was soo tender and the gravy was seasoned to perfection. 
I followed the recipe except for three tasty diversions:
1. Used beef stew meat (cubed)
2. Whole peeled pearl onions + a shallot instead of 2 c onion, and
3. Mashed potatoes for starch instead of egg noodles. 
Everyone said to double the gravy, so I did, and the extra liquid helped carry it through the two hour cook time nicely. Also, made enough gravy for the potatoes. 
Idea! Try adding baby potatoes and carrots to the beef & onions to make a savory stew.",,

I will add to Molly's review that this bread is meant to be topped. I don't think anybody expects pizza dough to have a lot of flavor either. 
Most cultures have some kind of flatbread and/or fry bread. 
This is one variation. The various Indian nations each have their own popular version, but all of them are basically the same in every culture - flour, water, salt, simple or no leavening. I put a little hole in the middle of mine.

955161,2781,2009-03-27,5,"These were just what I was looking for! I made it even easier by doing it in a food processor. Added all wet and sugars together until creamy, then added flour mix and pulsed until mixed. Then the grape nuts and cranberries and ran on slow for ~30 sec.(helps to break up the craisins a bit). I transffered it to a  bowl and mixed in the oats. Took maybe 5 minutes to make!! Love all the great textures and how soft and chewy they are. Thanks again!",,

I get abut 42 cookies, 16 rouned teaspoons per baking sheet on which they don&#039;t melt together as they bake.

I will say it does not taste like the Olive Garden version, but is is very good and everyone at the BBQ wanted the recipe...so that is always a good compliment.

I debated about adding minced garlic, as some reviewers did, but decided not to add it.  I was glad I didn't, even though, my family loves the ""stinking rose"", the delicate flavor of the artichoke, spinach, and parmesan would have been lost.

I followed the directions to a ""T,"" and the chicken came out dry with no liquid to make a ""gravy"" out of.  Why I'm giving it two stars as opposed to one, is that I was able to salvage some of the chicken breasts adding teryaki sauce and ""steaming"" in the microwave with a few TBs of water, used the rice I had made and served chicken tacos AND the fact that I live in Arizona and the hot weather we're having may have played into it drying out.

I doubled the recipe, used homemade chicken broth, and only used 3 cups onions instead of 4 cups. I did not double the white sauce, only the soup ingredients. Served it with crusty buns.

799439,2791,2008-03-23,5,"After finding about 3 different popular recipes for Outback's delicious Creamy Onion Soup (a.k.a. Walkabout Onion Soup), I decided to go with this one.  Am I'm glad I did!  

I made this for my wife and me, and we both loved it.  Taste-wise, it is pretty much identical, best I could tell (and I've eaten this soup at Outback quite a bit).  Texture-wise, it was slightly thinner, and slightly greasier -- but not enough to make a difference.  I was more concerned with taste than texture, and in that regard, it exceeded expectations.

Another note, I added a bit of sage, per comments from another review of another recipe (by an ex-Outback employee).  I think this made a difference, and possibly made it more like the original.  I also added a third oz. of Velveeta.  Lastly, while the ingredients call for 2 tbsp. of butter, the instructions call for 3 -- I went with 3, which may have been why it was a tad greasier.

Thanks, Molly, for the great recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again, and for a bigger party!",,

But delicious nonetheless! I also left out all the salt since I thought it would be too much with the bouillon cubes. (I subbed cubes with water for the broth.) Also used skim milk since that's all we keep around here!

I used low sodium chicken broth(safeway brand's has less sodium than Swanson's low sodium), and a lower sodium chicken boullion that came in a packet..I can't remember what it's called it has the word herbal in it.  That didn't make a too delicious flavor though so I added one chicken boullion cube without any water to match it.   I have made this recipe twice in the last week, it is delicious!

It was way too salty for my boyfriend and my taste and had too many onions.

I'm not a big onion fan, but I do appreciate the flavor they can give a dish. I chopped up only about a 1/4-1/2 a cup of onion and that was muuuch better.

I recently fixed it for my wife's family and we all agree that it tastes exactly like the original. The only thing I did different was to let it cook at least an hour longer on low heat. Also, I don't really think it's possible to use too many onions since they cook into the soup. I use about 4-5 medium sized onions for this recipe.

Normally I advocate following the recipe exactly as it is or else I don't review it but these were small changes.  I omitted the first 1/4 teaspoon of salt, used Knorr reduced stock (1 tub) in place of the bouillon and used Velveeta Queso Blanco rather than regular.  Those substitutions were due to what I had on hand.<br/><br/>The directions were very clear and I ended up with a creamy, oniony soup that was delicious just as it was and I'm sure I will make it again.  <br/><br/>If I were to serve it as a main dish for more than just myself, I would serve it with bowls of croutons, cooked potato cubes, diced ham, cooked corn, shredded cheese, etc...  so that people could dress it up themselves.

Didn&#039;t use the bouillon cubes, and maybe that&#039;s it.  Next time, I will try to prepare exactly to directions.  Even still, it&#039;s a flavorful soup that&#039;s very satisfying.

You do NOT need to do anything special with the &quot;white sauce&quot; - I know the other recipes you find on YouTube go into some detail about thickening the white sauce in another pot, but you DON&quot;T need to. I just put all the white sauce ingredients in a blender (flour, butter, whole milk) and blend until it is totally incorporated and actually foamy. This method completely eliminates the &quot;chunky&quot; uneven mix you get if the white sauce doesn't like the temperature of the chicken broth. Try it, it'll save you some time and cleanup.",,

283390,2797,2006-07-22,3,"This was pretty good, but it needs a bit of tweaking. Strangely for a recipe containing blue cheese, the taste of the cheese is overpowered by other flavors in the sauce (namely, the onion), even though I added extra cheese.  I roasted the onion at 350 for 40 minutes. It was tender (so I think I roasted it long enough), but the onion flavor was very strong and dominated the dish. Sauteing the onions in olive oil might make a difference; also, I think that 1/2 of a medium onion would be enough. This was a fast, easy meal...just not quite to my taste. Thanks for posting!",,

385661,2806,2006-11-21,0,"Hmmmmm it's very hard to decide what to rate stars wise as a battenburg has a lot more then 5 things needing to be judged. Let me start by saving i made half the amount as the recipe states it makes 2 cakes.
  The cake: No fault of recipe or instructions but because i made half it was hard to judge half so I made far more white cake then pink, if making full amount would be quite easy just do half amount in one bowl half in other.Was surprisingly eggy; surprisingly because I have very small eggs, other then that it tasted fine  - if making battenburg it mite be wise to make your fave maderia or sponge cake instead of the recipe suggested ( although prepare like instructions, half with red food coloring) unless someone works out how much egg should be used instead as it would be very nice if it wasn't so eggy. 
 The jamming together was easy - i used rasberry jam because that was what I had.
 The almond paste - or marzipan was delicious and tasted like brought marzipan but this was ware I had the trouble I forgot to but caster suagr on my surface before I attempted to roll it out and it stuck to the rolling pin so I used my hands to smooth it and cover the cake - it made just the rite amount and you really must put the caster sugar on top to  make absolutely delicious marzipan turn into wonder marzipan, maybe it's because it has egg yolk in it, my mum makes it for passover but only uses egg whites hmmm...
  So my Battenburg is stuck to the surface i made it on and it doesn't look so good because hands don't work as well as rolling pins unfortunately but other then that very good.
 Hmmm actually had a slice now, before I tasted the cake separate to the marzipan but together the marzipan takes away the cakes eggy taste. My dad just had a piece and really liked it as well although he was disappointed to find out the pink and white cake were not different flavors, also when sliced, marzipan went with slice which is good and it looks good slices - despite my very poor efforts on rolling marzipan.

I just made this recipe and found the directions easy to follow, and the cake delicious. It did not take as much time to make as I thought: 15 minutes to mix cake ingredients, 15 minutes to mix almond paste, 25 minutes to bake cake, I allowed cake to cool to room temperature, actual construction with jam and rolling almond paste, which has a thick marzipan consistency, was about 30 minutes. The cake tastes very similar to pound cake. I followed the recipe exactly. I heated the apricot jam in small amounts as I used it, in the microwave on low for one minute. I ended up using about 4 or 5 tablespoons of lemon juice in the paste to give it a consistency i could work with. I had a bag of sliced almonds which I put in my small food processor to grind to a fine mealy consistency, and I used electric mixer to mix first the cake, then the paste. I did end up having to knead the almond paste by hand as it became thicker consistency. I used LOTS of confectioners/ caster sugar on my counter and on top of the almond paste to roll it and had no trouble with it sticking to the surface. I refrigerated the cakes after construction, and will try freezing the extra cake. I did it! I think Mrs. Next would be proud!",,

8629,2808,2003-09-27,5,"As good as any gourmet spread I've tasted.  With a food processor to chop the nuts and then mix the butter and honey, this spread can be put together in about 5 minutes or less. I made my spread using unsalted butter.",,
133174,2808,2009-01-04,5,This spread makes an excellent addition to fresh baked bread.  The butter and honey were whipped in the mixer and then the chopped pecans stirred in.  Ready in a flash.  The recipe was cut in half without a problem.,,

It was just a teeny bit yeasty tasting, so next time I will either cut the yeast by half a teaspoon, or dilute the beer with water.  This batter would also be great for pineapple rings and bananas.  We had it on fish and onion rings, which were amazingly yum!!!  Thanks!",,
31083,2814,2002-04-02,5,My 3 boys loved this. I had some plain bagels to cut up and dip. I did use jarred pasta sauce instead of the pizza sauce-but I would have used the same to make pizzas. This was easy to make and I will make it again!,,

I took jar'd spagehtti sauce and put it in an electric fondue pot and dipped prepared meatballs (thought meatballs would be more fun since we could use the dipping stick more often) and garlic breadsticks in it. Very yummy and a big hit. Not sure how to rate this, since I didn't use many of the ingredients, but wanted to give you the credit because if I wouldn't have seen this recipe, I would have never thought to do a Italian/pizza fondue. Thanks!!! :-)",,

451456,2814,2007-04-15,5,"Inspired by this recipe, I created my own vegan version.  I used about 8 oz. of Smart Grounds (ground beef alternative), about 1/2 cup leftover spaghetti sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, 10 oz. of Vegan Gourmet brand mozzarella ""cheese"" (cubed), onion powder, garlic powder, basil, and oregano.  Since Smart Grounds are already cooked, I just plopped all the ingredients in the fondue pot, covered it with foil, and stirred frequently until the ""cheese"" melted.

I made this dish as you directed, but I did add one seeded, deveined jalapeno with the other peppers.  It wasn't that noticible.  Maybe next time I will add some pepper flakes instead of the jalapeno.

Some portobellos can be so thick they don't get cooked all the way through,  so I found that if I grill them first (about 2-3 minutes a side) before stuffing them, they are cooked better. I add fresh chopped hot peppers from our garden to spice things up because that's what we like.  We eat 2 each as a main meal with a salad and we're completely satisfied.  I added fresh garlic but only after the mix is sauted.  The flavour of garlic comes through much stronger when it's not cooked.  We LOVE garlic!  I also added salt & pepper.  This is a real nice and easy meal.",,
198154,2815,2014-07-18,3,"While I thought these were pretty good, the rest of the family wasn&#039;t as impressed.  A couple of things I would do differently next time: Pre-grill the mushroom before stuffing so that it cooks all the way.  Add some more seasoning, at the very least garlic, salt and pepper. Cut back on the oil, you just need enough to keep the peppers from sticking to the pan.  I guess I should have read the other reviews before making these, most of them mention these points.  If I make these again, with these changes, I will up date my review.",,

In my area powdered sugar is not sold in boxes anymore, its bags, and I think they are bigger. They are 2 lbs. So I attempted to double your recipe using two potatos and one 2lb bag of sugar. I have no clue how much sugar was SUPPOSED to be in it because you didnt specify, but I did not think I would need more than 2lbs for only 2 potatoes. It liquified instantly and turned into a soupy mess. I had an extra 1 lb of confec. sugar on hand and added that and no good. As a last resort I added all the regular sugar in the jar in my kitchen, still a soupy mess. Any candy that requires that much sugar will probably kill you anyway.",,

I only used 1 pound of ground beef ( two pounds of meat is to much for just two of us LOL) So I cut back on most of the other ingredients ( I did add most of the onion,pepper and garlic but they were smaller) I used a Jack Daniels barbeque sauce instead of chili sauce. We wanted a nice thick layer of potatoes so I probably added more. I did add some butter on top of the potatoes to keep them from drying out. All is all a lovely meatloaf. I did not use fat free cheese. Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag as a Host Andi special Definite keeper.

Instead of pouring tomato sauce in the dish before cooking, I added butter to tomato paste and then split the pepper, covering with that paste.

Thank you for giving me so many ideas about potatoes and peppers! I will follow your instructions next time I have the proper ingredients!",,

My kids said the veggies made it a little difficult because snapper has a few bones, which are a litter easier to manage with a simple garlic, lemon and butter recipe.  I noticed our dinner guest did not use much of the sauce, olives or feta, all of which are served separately with this recipe, nor did she eat all of her portion of fish.  My husband had no comment, and he usually compliments recipes.",,

This was easy and the flavor was okay, but not spectacular. Who knows if it didn't turn out like it was supposed to or if it did and we just weren't wild about it though. I tried it with just under 1 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup olive oil, 2 1/2 tbsp thyme and 2 tbsp rosemary. If that's considerably off from what it should have been and the recipe's poster would post the correct amounts, I would consider trying it again.",,

That said, I wasn't sure why I needed water while browning the sausage, but did it...will not next time.  Will - and think this is critical - run cold water over the sausage b4 mixing w/egg - it was so hot it punched holes in the dough in some places.

I also used oyster sauce like one of the other reviewers for the same reason.  I didn't brown my garlic either because I've heard the garlic can get bitter if it's browned..so, just sauteed for a bit. Served with broccoli and egg drop soup. Thanks so much for this recipe.

I went ahead and used them and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour to compensate.  I thought that other than baking in 2 stoneware pans that I hadn't made any other changes...then discoved before reviewing that I had forgotten the vanilla.  I never missed it at all.  I felt that the applesauce really blended the flavors nicely.  Since dinner I've already eaten 3 pieces with butter on top...and am having to force myself to leave it alone.  Absolutely will be making this again.  Very good recipe.(By the way I suspect that the person who created this recipe was trying to cut down on fats and cholesterol...but you can use whole eggs if you wish, I did only because I didn't want to have leftover yolks.)",,

I substituted yogurt for the applesauce since the best (fattening) recipe I know calls for sour cream.

I only had three large bananas and it was perfect.  I made a tray of mini-muffins and one loaf that was a little on the small side.  
One thing to watch- I used a no-stick pan and it browned really quickly, I thought I was burning it.  I took it out at least ten minutes early and it was perfect and very moist.  The muffins stayed nice and light and were ready after 15 minutes (and hubby literally inhaled about 6 of them in one sitting, I've never seen him do that...).

Uses all the basic ingredients, but the results are incredible! The only thinkthat I did differently was use brown sugar instead of white sugar. But just remeber that if you are using overly ripe bananas...like I did, minimize the amount of sugar because it was a bit too sweet. Other than that, theres no complaints from me!

Baked the muffins for about 25 mins and I'm sure they'll be singing for more tomorrow.",,
26711,2886,2004-06-20,5,This was the best!  I didn't use a loaf pan but an 8x8 disposable cake pan.  I had enough left over to also use 2 small round tin pans (the ones the size of chicken pot pie pans).  I added about 1/4 Cup walnuts which was just enough so it didn't taste nutty.  I think the 4 bananas and the vanilla made it taste just right.  Also creaming the butter and sugar rather than just stirring made a major difference from other banana breads I have tried.  I will definitely be making this recipe again and will pass onto my friends.  Thanks!,,

121852,2886,2004-07-23,5,This is the best banana bread we've ever had. I did have to increase the baking time about 20 minutes to get it done in the middle. The bananas I used were huge! Thanks for sharing this very good recipe.,,
10033,2886,2004-08-07,5,"Terrific bread! Made this this morning to use up LOTS of old bananas I bought on sale. I made three mini-loaves, so I only baked them for about 35-40 minutes. They were so gorgeous and brown! Thanks for posting!",,
122175,2886,2004-08-29,5,"I was looking for a banana bread recipe to use up 4 over-ripe bananas and this fit the bill for all the ingredients I had on hand.  I was nervous, as it was baking, as I did the dishes because I discovered that I only put in 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup as directed.  The bread's taste and texture turned out great, however, and I look forward to making it again with the right amount of sugar!",,
155595,2886,2004-09-04,5,Even better the next day!  It was even more moist the next day and it really does keep well in the fridge.  I will be using your recipe for the holidays.  Thanks!!,,

155675,2886,2005-01-21,4,"Lovely taste. The best I've tried and I've been experimenting a lot lately.  I may try reducing the butter to 1/3 of a cup, as it was a teeny bit greasy, but absolutely delicious.

91655,2886,2005-01-29,5,"Very moist and great flavor.  Followed the recipe to a ""T"".  I'll probably bake the bread less than an hour next time...the edges were slightly overdone.  (My gas oven may be a little warmer).  Overall great recipe!",,
196111,2886,2005-02-15,5,This was a fabulous banana bread recipe.  So many of them use too few bananas and too much butter or oil.  I made one batch with the butter and one batch substituting 1/2 cup of apple sauce for the butter and both turned out wonderfully.,,
201064,2886,2005-04-03,5,the name says it all 'the best banana bread ever'!! my family loved this bread!! thanks for a winner lkadlec! ,,

Even if putting batter upto the rim, they formed a ""saucer"" top.  But they still tastes fabulous with black ""lines"" that i am looking for in a banana bread. I use 6 (5-6"") very black/ripe bananas and added only 3/4 c sugar, and 1/3 c margarine.  Next time i'll reduce the sugar more if i am using a VERy ripe bannas coz they turned out too sweet for us.",,

184081,2886,2005-07-06,3,This was good bread. It may have been the really overripe bananas I used but I had to bake mine for much longer than the time given. When I took it out it was still a little underdone but was gobbled up all the same. I think I'll attempt this again in the future with regular bananas to be on the safe side! Thanks for sharing.,,

237758,2886,2005-08-21,4,"This is a great recipe - the bread has a great flavor, and it is extremely easy to make. I often add a handful of chopped walnuts to give the bread a little something extra, and it comes out delicious! The reason why I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 has nothing to do with taste. It has to do with cooking time. At 350 degrees for one hour, the loaves have come out dark brown and dry around the edges and completely uncooked (not just undercooked) in the middle. I have a brand new oven with very precise temperature settings, so I'm confident that my oven is not causing the problem. I'm still working on a way to make this bread bake evenly, and I think it's worth the time spent experimenting. If you do make this recipe, you might want to check it several times during the cooking process and/or check out the cooking times and temperatures listed for some comparable banana bread recipes on this site for better results.",,
176831,2886,2005-08-31,5,I also made muffins using this recipe and added some walnuts.  It was so simple to make using 'cups' and my son loved helping me.  Definately the best my muffins have ever turned out!,,

This simple recipe is outstanding!! 

I used 2 HUGE bananas , I can only imagine the taste with 4! 

I also didn't have a loaf pan, so I greased and floured an 8x8 square pan , set the timer for 20 minutes and kept checking after the 20 minutes was up. It took about 40 minutes to be done. 

MOIST!

Oh , I also used Almond flavoring instead of vanilla, only because it's my new ""thing""  LOL

I only had 3 bananas so I put in roughly crushed walnuts with the bananas and garnished with walnut halves on top after pouring into the loaf tray for a good texture. And I didn't have baking soda so I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead.",,

This was absolutely delicious.  I did add a can of blueberries, because I had them.  I doubt that made much difference.  It's a really ""banana"" flavor.  I took the hint from another poster, and let it sit on the counter (in the pan and before I put it in the pan) for about 20 min.  

I think this would work nicely in muffins, and just check them a while before the hour is up.  An absolute keeper.

I forgot to time it, and I believe I took it out early, because after cutting a few slices (hot from the oven), the center was oozing.  I hope I don't forget to get the remainder out before it's burned, but at least I got two slices.",,

335713,2886,2007-12-01,5,WOW WOW WOW!!  This was the BEST banana bread I have ever eaten!!  I just about ate the whole loaf!!  The butter is what makes this bread.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.  I'm sharing this one with my family and friends.,,

357323,2886,2007-12-08,5,"Loved it! I used 1/3 less fat margarine, and added chopped walnuts, cinnamon and nutmeg. I don't think the extra spices made much difference though. This is a great, easy bread!",,

218535,2886,2007-12-16,3,Tried this recipe but was disappointed. Not as flavorful or as moist as Sour Cream Banana Bread (Recipe #9351).,,
612873,2886,2007-12-16,3,"the flavor was very good, however i found it a little too greasy,i will cut down on the butter a little and add a tsp of baking powder to give it a little lift.  All in all it does taste very good and will be using butter instead of shortening that called for in my other recipe.",,
140806,2886,2007-12-31,5,"I should have waited a little longer before cutting into the loaf, because it was still kinda mushy. Next day it had set up really well and was delicious topped with crunchy peanut butter. I might reduce the banana ever so slightly next time, maybe to 3 1/2. Great recipe. I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor.",,
717436,2886,2008-01-06,5,"i have gone thru many banana bread recipes that were a huge letdown...either too mushy in the middle or too tough, etc.  this one is simple and delicious and it comes out PERFECT every time!!  to keep the edges from getting overdone i cover the bread in foil and then cut an opening in the center of the foil so that the middle of the bread gets fully cooked.  i have played around and added/substituted  to this recipe like using plantains instead of bananas, adding shredded coconut, and using almond extract instead of vanilla...it had a very 'Caribbean' flavor and was a big hit!!  but, you really cant go wrong with this great basic recipe-awesome job ikadlec!!",,
725883,2886,2008-01-13,4,"Normally I make a low-fat moist banana bread. This recipe was more of a bread. We enjoyed in our home but will probably go back to substituting applesauce for butter. It also was much sweeter than we were use to... that being said, it will not last long in the house!",,

Thanks for the recipe!",,
777092,2886,2008-06-09,5,"Yum-me! Yummy!!!

I was in search of a banana bread to sneak in fruit for my 15 month old.  Next time I'm going to do some substitutions to bring the sugar down.

I did follow one reviews suggestion to let the batter sit for 20 minutes.  I have no idea if that helped or why it would help.

I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.

I love that thi recipe is so basic and the ingrediants are all pantry staples.  I can see making this weekly.  Walnuts would make it even better.  But, we are holding off on nuts until my son is a litle older

I was worried about the time being too long from other reviews.  I think that it was about 40 minutes when I took it out of the oven.  I for sure suggest checking on it at 40 minutes.",,

I do change it up a little to (try) to make it a little healthier-- I use whole wheat flour,  reduce sugar to 3/4 cup, and add 3 TBS of flax seeds, and sometimes I sub apple sauce for half the butter.

So I subbed buckwheat, threw in all six frozen bananas, added another 1/4 cup of buckwheat, and used oh my chai tea powder for flavoring.

I added some allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon for some extra flavor the 2nd time I made this and it worked great. It was a little too sweet the first time I made it, but I think it was because I used extra-ripe bananas so if you use very ripe bananas, use less sugar (like 1/4 cup less).",,

765437,2886,2008-07-22,5,"Not that this recipe needs another sterling review, but here's mine...
This bread is incredibly moist with a great banana flavor and a nice crust. I've tried other recipes and the part that touches the pan is a little too thick and overcooked tasting. The crust was as good as the rest of the loaf with this recipe! Mine stuck to the bottom of the pan, even after sitting for 10 minutes to cool initially. Next time I'll use butter and flour rather than spray and flour to grease the pan. 
I also was out of all-purpose flour, but had whole wheat and cake flour. So, I used 1 cup + 2 T cake flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I think the whole wheat flour gave it a nice deep flavor, and it didn't make it too dense or dry at all.  
This is definitely something I will make regularly, and a great recipe to fiddle around with!",,

This recipe was quick and easy and I really needed that with 3 small children.  I did let the batter sit in the pan for 20 minutes, but not on purpose.

I found 2 bags of overripe bananas at the store for only 99 cents, so I used them all up this evening with this recipe.  This is the perfect banana bread recipe - great banana taste, very moist and not spongy like some other banana breads that I've tried.   I covered the full sized loaves with aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes of bake time so that the tops wouldn't be too browned.  I also substituted butter flavored Crisco for the butter because I found I didn't have any butter on hand.  This is now the only recipe I'll use.",,

I covered it with foil for the last 10 minutes like another reviewer suggested, but that didn't seem to do the trick for me.  I don't bake often, so I have a feeling that this is my error and I'll have to see what I need to do differently next time.

I also tossed in a jar of carrots and apples because I am an undercover healthy food freak.  I doubled the recipe and used half wheat flour.  I resisted the urge to use splenda for the sugar, but I did use Smart Balance for the butter and you couldn't tell the difference.  I thought about adding some walnuts or craisins, but I didn't have any in my cupboard.  The carrots and apples are not noticable flavors in the finished product.",,

760929,2886,2008-12-12,5,"Yummy! These were perfect, not gummy and sticky like some other recipes I've tried.
I made 12 muffins and baked them for 18 minutes.  Here are some changes I made:
- only used 3 bananas
- added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon
- substituted Splenda for 1/3 of the sugar
- added about 5 very finely crushed walnuts
- spinkled a cinnamon sugar topping on before baking.",,
465524,2886,2008-12-14,5,"Outstanding. Easy, quick, and most of all...delicious. I doubled it and made two loaves, (because I had a lot of bananas) and it's a good thing I did. Thank you.",,
975947,2886,2008-12-27,5,"Wow- so amazing!  My husband even said that he never had banana bread this good! I will never use another recipe again!
I did everything as directed, but I did add cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.
Sensational and absolutely delicious! THANK YOU!!",,
517410,2886,2009-01-09,5,"This is a simple, sure-fire recipe for banana bread. What great flavor! For extra flavor and texture, I added a topping to the crust:  crushed pecans (walnuts would be good, too) and brown sugar.  No need to measure for the topping.  Just sprinkle it evenly over the top of the batter and bake as usual.",,
1131834,2886,2009-01-16,5,"Wow!!!  Easy & the tastiest banana bread I have ever had!  I threw everything into my big mixer including the sliced banana.  It mashed it up very well.  And threw in the whole eggs.  I followed someone else's recommendation & let the mixure sit in the pan for about 20 before putting it in the oven.  Yummy!!!!   I will be making again, and again!",,
622554,2886,2009-01-16,0,I triple loves this one just like it is.  The second time I made it I put in 1Tbl. Cinnimon and 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  The family liked it even better!,,
130513,2886,2009-01-21,5,"Oh MY!  I used up my stock of old bananas I had in the freezer and mmmm mmmm mmmmm this was fantastic.

How I altered this recipe:  
First, I doubled it.  
I split the sugar:  half turbinado, half granulated.  
I split the flour:  half whole wheat, half unbleached all-purpose. 
I didn't pre-beat the eggs or pre-crush the bananas.  It all went in the mixer together.
I added chopped walnuts.

Baked for an hour and turned out beautifully!  Thanks Ikadlec!",,
1102734,2886,2009-01-24,5,I made this for a scrapbooking event and everyone loved it!  I'd never made banana bread before and this was so simple to make.  The bread was very moist.  My kids sampled it and have been bugging me all day to make more!  I added a tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg and also took the advice of another reviewer and left the batter sit for 20 minutes before putting it in the oven.  Heavenly!!,,
385423,2886,2009-01-27,5,"I've tried many banana breads, well over 30 different recipes.  So far this is the VERY best one!  I add a little banana extract to it though if the bananas are not black enough yet.  I have 3 batches baking right now so we have some for breakfast and the rest will go in the freezer to be used later.  Thanks for posting.",,
1029127,2886,2009-02-01,5,What an easy recipe and tastes great too!  I made it lower fat by only using 6 T of butter and added 2 T of applesauce.  My family could not tell the difference!,,

22655,2886,2009-02-07,3,"I thought this was okay, nothing special. The oven temp and length of time is either too hot or too long. You need to keep an eye on the loaf or it will burn. I added walnuts. My husband ate and he liked it alright.",,
742029,2886,2009-02-08,3,"I thought this was good, but not the best. There is another recipe on this site for Crumb Topped Banana Muffins (#43509) that is much better than the ""best banana bread"" recipe.

281187,2886,2009-02-23,4,I am surpised to see a few low ratings.  I think this is an AWESOME banana bread recipe and I consider myself a bit of an epicurean especially when it comes to baking.

808648,2886,2009-03-07,5,"This bread smelled wonderful cooking and it was so easy to make. I did have one problem though, it browned real fast.

Not only did it take 5 min (which is very important for someone like me ,being that i have a 3yr old and 18mth old) to make but it was delicious!!!Came out super moist. The other reviews were right about it not cooking all the way in the middle,for me not a big deal. I just turned off the oven and left it in there untill the oven cooled down.came out perfect. Good Luck!!",,
815198,2886,2009-04-14,5,"This is an awesome banana bread recipe. I made it into muffins and they were so moist and they cooked up great!! No complaints here, thanks for the great recipe!!",,
1225715,2886,2009-04-19,2,good but nothing special.  this recipe is cool because it doesn't require buttermilk which i rarely have on hand.  i think i'll try out the other banana bread recipes after this.  i baked two 3 by 6 loaves and they were toothpick test done in 30 minutes.  UPDATE:  I've decided to downgrade this recipe from a 3 to a 2 because I realized the following few days that I really don't like this banana bread and instead of eating a piece here and there I let it sit and get moldy.  This recipe is really really bla.,,

I chose this recipe because it used 4 bananas, and I had 4 way-over-ripe bananas sitting on my counter after I returned from vacation over the Memorial Day long weekend.  Plus, it had some great reviews.  I made the recipe exactly as directed, except I poured the batter into a muffin tin rather than a loaf pan.  This made 18 muffins for me.

This version is better.  My very slight alterations are that I used ""brownulated"" light brown sugar and doubled the vanilla measurement to 1 full teaspoon.  Another reviewer mentioned covering the pan with foil & cutting a slit all the way down the middle to prevent the edges from over-browning - a very good tip which worked!",,
1294597,2886,2009-06-26,5,Awesome! I made some for myself and shared it with my co-workers and they were gone in less than an hour. I should've made more.,,

My Grandma used to make the BEST banana bread, unfortunately, she's past but the memory of the bread still lives on, and this recipe is a very very close running to tasting the same.  My mom and I have been searching for years to find one that compares and finally we found it in this recipe-thank you.  The only difference I make, which my Grandma did, is put black walnuts in it.  Thanks again-you've brought back some great memories!",,
1310292,2886,2009-07-16,5,"A lovely recipe. I made it exactly as specified except I lined the pan in cooking paper AND, most importantly, I cooked it for 30 minutes and then covered the bread pan with foil and continued cooking. Perfect!",,

777453,2886,2009-08-11,5,"Yum! Just ate it fresh from the oven, and my 2 yr old is also devouring it! This si what I did different- I used nonfat yogurt instead of butter,  3/4 cups sugar, only had 3 bananas but they were well over ripe, I used half whole wheat flour and half white and that worked out great! They loaf seemed a little dense but once I tasted it, it was great! Ive never made BB and this turned out really good! I think with the whole wheat flour, it helped alot that I sprinkled some brown sugar and cinnamon on top before baking- SO GOOD with that topping! Yum. 50 minutes did it in my oven and left it nice and moist! Next time I'll probably cut down on the sugar as it was very sweet and hopefully I can get away with less sugar. Thanks !",,

1246335,2886,2009-08-17,5,"these are sooo good! I made them with my nieces and they had a blast making them.. The only things I changed were the bananas, instead of 4 I used 3; and i also baked these in a muffin tin. it made 12 muffins and I baked them at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes (until a toothpick comes out clean).",,
314481,2886,2009-08-30,5,Simple yet delish.  My 4 and 5 years old daughters enjoyed helping out with this treat.  We used margarine in place of butter and baked it 15 to 20 minutes less than the time given in the recipe for that cake-like softness.  Thank you so much for sharing.,,
287084,2886,2009-08-30,5,I love this recipe for bana bread it is very moist and yummy. I don't make mine with nuts as I'm not a fan but I'm sure if you added about 1/2 cup it would work well!,,

139487,2886,2009-10-19,5,"This was DEELICIOUS! We absolutely devoured the thing--51 minutes at 350 in a convection oven was perfect.  I used 3 ripe bananas and 6 super ripe mini bananas--I think the mini bananas added a bit of sweetness that was excellent! I also added a few shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg, and used brown sugar instead of white....we'll be making this weekly! (or, daily at this rate!) Thanks for the awesome recipe, lkadlec!",,
1219701,2886,2009-10-25,0,"I have made this bread on numerous occasions, my b/f went for a fishing trip with the guyz, I made 2 loaves, (easily done, doubling the recipe) they arrived Friday afternoon and the bread was gone Saturday morning!!!! Was definately a hit, my Son just came home from B.C. and the recipe is on the fridge he said ""Best Banana Bread?"", well I made it and he is a believer!!!

1328942,2886,2009-10-25,4,"I give this a 4 out of 5 because although it tasted great, the texture was a bit oily for us. It seemed almost too moist. If I try this again, I'll be sure to use either 3/4 or 1/2 the amount of butter. I did add some walnuts and that could have made it oilier due to the oil that seeps from the nuts. So, to be fair I'll have to try this without nuts next time. But, overall the taste was great!",,

But, this weekend, I refused to go to the store to pick up ""sour cream, chocolate chips, nuts, blahblahblah"" that so many other recipes require. I wanted a BASIC no-frills recipe that turned out a stunning loaf: that's not asking too much, is it?  So, How.Good.Was.It??? The 1st batch was gone in 22 minutes: some of the kids even had to blow on them to cool them down! The 2nd batch, the little scamps will have to wait until after supper!

526379,2886,2010-10-05,5,Unbelievably yummy bread for not having any fancy ingredients like heavy whipping cream or buttermilk or whatnot.  Simple and great!,,
471300,2886,2009-12-30,5,"This is really great banana bread.  The recipe is really easy, and it came out really well, lovely dark brown crust, moist inside and great banana flavour.  I was worried that it wouldn't come out because my oven can have problems with bigger baked goods like bread and cakes but it was perfect.  Will make again for sure!  There is a reason that this has so many great reviews!",,
1117099,2886,2010-01-03,4,"Great recipe1 Although with 4 bananas it was really wet when done, I may try with less banana next time. All in all great tasting!",,

696459,2886,2010-01-17,5,Made this around the holidays and it has excellent moist flavor.  I even tried a lowfat version of this with the egg substitute and light margarine and it still came out tasting wonderful.  I am adding this to my collection.  Thanks for posting it!,,

Not sure if it's my stupid oven's fault, but I fear that if I left it another 5 minutes, burning results would follow. Such a simple recipe provided the yummiest banana bread I've ever consumed. BRILLIANT!",,
1218405,2886,2010-02-09,5,Very good. I only had 3 bananas and I didn't have vanilla. I added a little nutmeg and some chopped pecans. I checked it after 55 minutes and it was done. Hubby said it was good. Recipe seems to be adaptable to what you have and still come out good.,,
1408007,2886,2010-02-10,5,Fantastic recipe!  The bread was very moist and flavorful.  I also added walnuts to mine.  Thank you for posting!,,

I added Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Walnuts and decreased butter to 1/3 cup as another review said it was too greasy and used 1/2 sugar & 1/2 brown sugar. Nice to have a basic recipe in which I don't need to go to the store to buy an ingredient",,

519896,2886,2010-03-25,5,"This was a very good and easy banana bread recipe.  I used a glass loaf dish, which may have contributed to it being a little more well done (bottom 1/2"" was browner than rest of loaf). Very tasty - thanks!",,
1591131,2886,2010-04-03,5,Seems to burn in my gas oven if I bake for the full sixty minutes. I go about 45. Best banana bread I have ever had and I have tried many varieties. This recipe is used over and over. It keeps well for several days as well.,,
1235696,2886,2010-04-09,5,"i made it with 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and 2 TB of milk--cut back on saturated fats a bit. worked just fine!",,
68941,2886,2010-04-16,0,Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  I have made it many times now. I usually double the recipe and add 2-3 cups of chopped walnuts.   It always comes out moist and delicious.,,
261194,2886,2010-04-17,0,"I'm dubious that letting the batter stand before baking (Chef #307501) increases the banana flavor; when the bananas are pureed to begin with and then baked for an hour, all their flavor is going to permeate the bread anyway.  (Moreover, letting a baking-powder-based batter stand before baking can dissipate the rising power.)  There are better ways of getting more banana flavor.  One is to use overripe bananas: their skins should be black all over, past the speckled stage, and the flesh inside should be soft, sticky, and somewhat golden.  Or, simply use more bananas: the standard proportions are 4 medium bananas to 2 cups of flour, but the bananas can be increased by 50% without throwing off the other ingredients.  And competing flavors should be avoided; vanilla tends to tone down fruitiness, and lemon rind (as in ""Joy of Cooking"") is ridiculous.",,
1590994,2886,2010-04-21,5,I had 3 overripe bananas that I need to use so I looked here and found this recipe.  I only used the 3 bananas I had and it still worked fine.  I also added chopped pecans to mine (since that is what I had in the pantry).  My husband and I LOVED it!  I will make this one again and agian!  Thanks!!!,,
1495014,2886,2010-04-21,5,I'm not sure WHY this recipe is so good... but it really is. Maybe because it calls for 4 banana's instead of only 2-3? Try it... you won't be sorry.,,
1604078,2886,2010-04-25,5,"This bread turns out great, it's a simple and easy recipe to follow.  I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar and it was still moist and delicious.  I will probably use less sugar next time as it was already so sweet from the bananas.",,
1602122,2886,2010-04-27,5,"I made this last night and it wasn't until I was taking it out of the oven that I realized I forgot to add the eggs.  I went ahead and tasted it anyhow.  Between my husband and I, we demolished that loaf.  I baked 2 more loaves today, this time WITH the eggs.  After tasting both batches, my husband decided he liked it better withOUT the eggs.  It left the inside with a doughier texture yet it was thoroughly cooked.  (It did take longer to bake though.)  This recipe is a keeper!",,
759407,2886,2010-05-02,5,"This banana bread is excellent.  In case you are short on bananas, I've used it with 3 bananas with no problems.  I find that I usually have to bake it for an extra 10 minutes (i.e., 70 minutes total) to make sure it is cooked all the way through -- but then again, I usually add one cup of chocolate chips to the recipe :)  Highly recommended, you can't go wrong with this recipe.",,

1183373,2886,2010-06-16,5,Currently making this again.  I am so happy to find a recipe that didn't require buttermilk!  It turned out fluffy and not heavy like most recipes I've used.  Thanks!,,
1227477,2886,2010-06-22,5,This recipe is AMAZING! It came out so moist and had the perfect crust.  My husband loved it and has requested more! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!,,
1290488,2886,2010-06-23,0,I used three bananas and two jars of banana baby food was only gonna use one jar but my 5 year insisted we had to put both jars in. also realized halfway through i didn't have baking soda since we just moved and everything that was in the fridge at old house got thrown away. So I substituted 1tsp baking soda for 3 tsp baking powder since that's what my cookbook says under substitutes. Also I did muffins. Which they were still really good even with all the stuff i did.,,
487931,2886,2010-06-27,5,"I made this in accordance with the recipe with the exception that I used 3 bananas instead of 4. I received A TON of compliments on the moistness and taste. I made 1/2 the batch with walnuts and the other 1/2 without nuts. I made muffins to take to the office (instead of a loaf). Anytime a banana is in risk of going bad, I stick it in the freezer for this recipe! The recipe is definitely a keeper!",,
1423184,2886,2010-07-03,5,WHOLY BANANAS! This is the BEST banana bread I have EVER made and I have made banana bread many times. I doubled the batch and used I cup ww flour and 2 cups white flour. I also cut out 1 cup of sugar and it was SUPER moist. So glad I chose this recipe over the top one.,,
241348,2886,2010-07-12,5,"This was my first attempt at making banana bread. THIS WAS REALLY GOOD! I'll be adding nuts next time only because I like them. but other than that, I wouldn't change anything. ITS GREAT!",,

I didn't find it to be anything exceptional- it was very good, just not anything better than any other banana bread that I've made. Would I make it again? Yes. Though I would probably add some choppsed walnuts for texture.",,
1052873,2886,2011-02-09,5,"This was so easy! Good, too. Kids like this better than banana banana bread, which is my favorite. Used 2 frozen, 2 overripe and microwaved to make them really mushy. Should have floured the pan in addition to the Pam.",,
1551700,2886,2011-03-02,0,This is a no fail recipe for banana bread.  It is excellent.  What I did to make it a little healthier was I substituted applesauce for the butter and it came out really moist.  If you want a great snack I would definately recommend this recipe.  Thanks lkadle,,
482376,2886,2011-04-12,4,I loved how high this banana bread rose. It was very moist and the banana flavor was nice and strong. I would probably eliminate one banana next time so the bread wouldn't be as moist. I like mine a little bit drier (personal preference). Thanks!,,
358095,2886,2011-05-10,5,"This is fantastic!  I used applesauce instead of butter, whole wheat flour instead of white, cut the sugar in half, and doubled the recipe.  I made muffins instead of a loaf (couldn't find my loaf pan!) and they still turned out great.  I cooked the muffins for about 25 minutes, and sprayed the papers with Pam (otherwise, the crust sticks to the paper).  Even with all those changes, they came out dense but moist, with a wonderful not-too-sweet banana flavor.  Great recipe!",,
203111,2886,2011-05-14,5,"Oh my goodness, this may be the best banana bread I've ever made or eaten!  I did use 1/4 cup applesauce in place of half the butter and I used half white and half brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I baked it in two aluminum bread pans for 50 min.  I let them rest for 10 min. after removing them from the oven, then got them out of the pans and cooled on a rack.  I then ate half a loaf and am thinking about going back for more.  It is SO Good!!!!",,
297557,2886,2011-06-22,5,I will never try another banana bread recipe because this one is the BEST!  I used four very ripe bananas (many freckles) and added a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  I divided the batter into two smaller foil pans and baked for about 35-40 minutes.  It is very moist and cake like with great banana flavor.  Thanks!,,
88169,2886,2011-06-23,4,I am new to making banana breads.  I baked it like directed and it got dry and didn't raise hardly at all.   The flavor was great tho.  Next time I will watch it and take it out of the oven sooner.,,
1942885,2886,2011-06-27,5,I have made numerous versions of banana bread and I really like this one! I like to add a sprinkle of brown sugar on the top before baking...really adds a little extra without being too sweet...thanks so much for the recipe. I actually make these as muffins.,,
616257,2886,2014-05-15,5,Easy and delectable.  What more could you ask for in a recipe.  We always add walnuts as that what my kids and husband prefer.  One bowl kitchen aid boom done!!!,,
353934,2886,2011-06-28,5,I love it!!! It's so moist and yummy. I'm definately NOT a baker but found this recipe to be simple and very easy taking only a few minutes to throw everything together. I added a 1 tsp of Cinnamon and replaced the regular sugar with brown sugar and it was so flavourful.  My husband loves it and Thank you so much for sharing this recipe I give it 5 stars!!!,,
317696,2886,2011-06-29,4,"This made a very nice bread.  To cut back on the fat and calories by just a little bit, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups and I substituted 3 tbsp of butter with apple sauce.  Because my bananas were on the small side, I got a fluffy bread.  It wasn't overly moist (though it wasn't dry either).  I would say it had the consistency of cake.  I will likely be turning to this one again.",,

1409011,2886,2011-09-22,5,"Simple recipe, excellent banana bread.  By far a favorite in our house.  I've started making them into muffins instead - makes about 16. I cook them for about 20-25 minutes. And I put in about a half cup of wheat flour (the rest, white flour).",,
2125470,2886,2011-12-28,5,Delicious! Great texture and just enough sweet. I may add another banana and I did add cinnamon. Yum!,,
1714566,2886,2011-12-29,4,"I thought this recipe was very good - but not perfect enough for 5 stars.  It seemed to be missing something, but I am not sure what.  I ended up checking the bread with a toothpick at one hour of cooking and it was very runny in the center, so I added 5 minutes to the cook time.  I took it out then (65 minutes) and the bottom and edges were a little too done for me (very dark brown).  I will be making this again and will definitely take it out at 60 minutes even if the center does not seem done, as it will continue to cook once it's out of the oven.",,
2097025,2886,2012-01-02,5,I have made this bread 3 times an I love it.  I substitute margarine and Splenda and it only needs to cook 45 minutes (at sea level).  Make sure to spray the top of the dough with cooking spray before placing in the oven when using Splenda to make sure it browns.,,
1701212,2886,2012-01-11,5,"This is a great recipe. I just made a double batch last night. The couple things I tweaked were, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I added a half cup of sour cream. Very yummy!!",,
1619362,2886,2012-01-17,5,"I found this recipe about 2 years ago and have made it countless times.  Everywhere I bring it I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  The best was when my 7 year old nephew says to me ""This is the best banana bread I've ever had!""  I usually use 5 bananas instead of 4 because I love dense, moist breads.  And the key to a really good banana bread is using black bananas.  So when bananas go bad I stick them in my freezer and wait til I have enough to make a loaf.  I even made a gluten free loaf once with rice flour and it was still delicious and moist.  I will never use another banana bread recipe!",,

2216812,2886,2012-05-07,4,"Very good! Toothsome with a great slightly-chewy texture.

Super easy to make, the flavor is incredible and the texture is perfect!  If it weren't for the calories I wouldn't change it.  But I think I can get away with using 1/2 the butter and maybe using 1/2 the sugar.  I see some of you used brown sugar for a healthier change but I don't think that matters much since sugar is sugar no matter the color.   And I might try browning the butter a bit first to try and get a more intense flavor.     <br/>I made this exactly the way explained and baked it for precisely 60 minutes in a ceramic bread pan.

2358476,2886,2012-09-02,5,"Liked this banana bread! Liked the amount of bananas used in this recipe. The best part about this recipe is the amount of time it took to make and have in the oven! I think it took about 8 or 10 minutes and it was baking. I have a good banana recipe that I like, but the prep seems to take much longer. Will make again for sure! ( a tip about mashing bananas--I like to use a potato masher in a glass pie pan--it really speeds things up, and is easy to clean up!)",,

2688692,2886,2013-02-11,4,Great recipe!  I never made banana bread from scratch before but since I was forced to go gluten free mixes were no longer an option.  This recipe is wonderfully simple and delicious.  I use cup4cup as a gluten free flour replacement and it comes out great!  It's nice finally being able to bake something my whole family loves which is tough when baking without gluten.  Adding some walnuts and/or chocolate chips makes it to die for.  I'll be making it for the fourth time this week once the bananas are ready.,,

I add chopped dark chocolate (about 1/2 cup), 3/4 cups of chopped walnuts, and about 3/4 cups of Baker&#039;s shredded coconut (sweetened).  And since there is sugar from the chocolate and coconut, I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup.  So gooood!!",,

2937923,2886,2013-08-09,5,I have tried countless banana bread recipes in the years since I have been baking.  I have thought I had found the perfect recipe but curious to see if this was indeed the best banana bread.  And the results are that this is IN FACT the BEST banana bread recipe I have EVER tried.  I doubled the recipe using 8 large bananas.  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose flour.   I doubled the vanilla since I love vanilla.  I also added a 2 cups of walnuts to the double recipe batter and sprinkled some additional ones on top of both loaves.  I baked the bread for about 70 minutes in my Breville Smart Oven.  Once removed from the oven I covered tightly with foil and steamed for 30 minutes.  I then removed to a cooling rack to finish cooling.  The bottom stuck ever so slightly in the middle of the pan so next time I will lightly flour the pan after spraying with cooking spray.  The bread was SUPER moist.  It had the most wonderful banana flavor.  The crust was perfectly brown.  I am extremely impressed with this recipe.  It takes a lot to impress me and this recipe definitely impressed me.,,
2944270,2886,2013-08-14,5,"Love banana bread! This is definitely the best! I used glass bread pans and so I turned my oven on (25 degrees lower is recommended) 50 degrees lower and cooked it a little longer:) My family loves it, even my son who is very picky said it was the best!",,
2953520,2886,2013-08-21,5,This was a great recipe! I have been searching for a good one trying out about 4 different recipes. It was a great balance of flavours. I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to make it a decadent treat! No need to ever try a different recipe.,,

I have been using this recipe for several years now. For variety, sometimes I add a little peanut butter in the batter and other times I add a few chopped pecans or walnuts. I also add nutmeg to the recipe each time. I have used this basic recipe to make pumpkin and sweet potato bread and varying the spices to suit my taste. I find that the main thing is not to overbake.",,

394288,2886,2013-09-29,5,Love this recipe. I usually end up making this once a week since my toddler stopped eating the bananas I always buy. I usually substitute half the sugar with brown sugar and I spray the pan then coat it with sugar to give it a sweet crunch to the crust. This is an amazing recipe that is always no fail for me.,,

2887423,2886,2013-10-29,5,YUM! This is a great banana bread recipe.. it comes out more like a moist cake then regular banana bread. Only thing I did different was use dark brown sugar instead of regular sugar. This is a recipe to try!,,

Also I  didn&#039;t crush my banana before I added to butter/sugar mixture so I ended up with pieces of banana in the bread.  I think I like it that way.  Also over ripe bananas make a huge difference.  I just tasted while it was hot and it was delish. I was using the Gold Medal Banana Bread but this my new fav. Walnuts would take this over the top,,

If you use dark colored loaf pans reduce heat to 325 degrees. Keep a close eye I recommend starting @30 minutes baking time and go from there.&lt;br/&gt;This recipe was moist. Folding in your flour will keep the bread tender once baked. The family liked it.,,

Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!&quot;  I changed nothing, and it truly was the best banana bread I&#039;ve ever made :-).  Not sure if my altitude caused it to rise a ton, but it almost overflowed so I scooped some out and put it in muffin tins, and both the loaf and muffins were perfect.  To be safe, next time I divided the batter into 2 loaf pans and made slightly smaller loaves than I normally would, but that&#039;s certainly no problem.

Fluffy and delicious. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a garnish, I melted a bit of butter (2 tbsp or so) and poured it over the top of the loaf along with a dusting of powdered sugar. Totally optional, that&#039;s just a thing I like to add to all my homemade banana breads to make the crust that much more delicious.",,

I made this using the same amount of bananas (1 1/3 cups) as other breads that call for 1.5 cups flour.  It came out fine but I wish I knew what the contributor&#039;s 4 bananas yielded then I&#039;d feel more confident in rating it.,,

I had some gnarly looking neglected bananas and limited resources so I chose this recipe simply because it required so few ingredients. I didn&#039;t even have white sugar in hand, so I substituted brown sugar I had leftover from a previous engagement with cookies (I used a recipe from this website actually and they were disgusting). Good news is this recipe turned out great! I added 1/3 cup of coconut oil because it adds a great flavor, aroma, and moisture to the bread!

Using a bundt pan as i feel there is too much for 1 loaf pan and not enough for 2. whenever i make ANY banana bread i never mix and bake as you need to let batter sit so banana flavor is full bodied. I also put bananas in oven,with skins on, for 20 min before using and that strengthens flavor as well.",,
336563,2886,2014-11-18,4,"Great banana bread!   Reduced sugar by 25% and will probably reduce more next time.  Pleasantly sweet but trying to reduce sugar across the board.  Increased bananas to about double small ones and added a 1/2 tsp baking powder.   Would probably reduce the heat 25 degrees next time as well.

1803448590,2886,2014-12-02,4,Great flavor. I was starting to get concerned about the color after 25 minutes remained. It looked like it was completely done and I was concerned I&#039;d either dry it out or burn it. The final result was a little dryer and darker than I prefer. I would definitely monitor cooking at the 30-40 minute mark. The 60 minute cooking time may not be necessary.,,

Very moist and delicious- I actually said &quot;WOW&quot;  out loud when I took my first bite.  I mix a 40/60 ratio of Sorghum/Millet &amp; Potato/Arrowroot. I used refined Coconut oil in lieu of butter and added a tsp of xantham &amp; 1 c.  of walnuts  (that a lot of walnuts, but we like em). Also used 1/2 c. cane sugar &amp; 1/2 cup brown sugar.

I also used 1/3 cup of maple syrup instead of sugar and 3 bananas instead of four ( I find it less sweet this way) I also added 1/4 tsp of baking powder because of the wheat flour.

I have made banana breads with alot more ingredients, more complicated recipes, but this is simple and delicious.  You really taste bananas.  It&#039;s now the only recipe I will ever use.  So glad I found it!",,
2000072962,2886,2015-03-19,5,I have made a lot of banana bread and have used numerous recipes. This is by far my favorite!! Would recommend to all.,,

2000094418,2886,2015-03-28,5,"This is great banana bread its easy and tastes great, one word of advice do not add in more banana&#039;s than the recipe calls for I added 5 bananas and it made for a great tasting but mushy on the inside bread. This is my new go to recipe!",,
2000106069,2886,2015-04-01,5,"NEVER waste your &#039;nanners on another recipe again.  This has been my go-to banana bread recipe for years. Hands down, the BEST.   It&#039;s fun to use chocolate chips too...but not TOO many &#039;cuz then you end up with a bit of a mess.  AND if anyone out there has experimented with incorporating peanut butter into this recipe, let me know...I&#039;d love to know measurements, etc  :)",,
2000131305,2886,2015-04-10,5,"This is a very simple, great tasting recipe. I add a little bit of cinnamon to mine, though I am sure it doesn&#039;t need it, I just like it :)
Great recipe!!!",,

Simple but scrumptious!",,
168612,2886,2015-04-13,4,A good basic banana bread recipe. I made it healthier by using half the butter and replacing the other half with applesauce. I used half the sugar (the applesauce replaces the sweetness) and added bran to the flour. Some cinnamon sprinkled in was a great compliment. Also some coconut on top really adds a nice flavor/texture as well :),,
2000010157,2886,2015-04-17,5,"This Recipe is delicious! Very moist &amp; I used white &amp; wheat flour. I also added walnuts. I was asked to share the recipe more than once, by request...that says it is awesome. Thank you for sharing this. It&#039;s a keeper!",,
2000159154,2886,2015-04-22,0,"I would love to rate this recipe as high as the others and I&#039;ve tried it twice.  It takes much, much, much, much, much, much (you get the point!) longer than 60 minutes to cook.  The middle never seems to cook beyond batter.  I&#039;m using a loaf pan as directed, but not having any luck with getting the middle to turn into a bread, instead of a liquid.  I&#039;ll look for a different recipe.",,
2000162060,2886,2015-04-24,4,Really good recipe!! I replaced half the butter with cream cheese and the texture came out great.,,
2000164885,2886,2015-04-25,5,"This bread is so great! I&#039;ve made is tons of times, and it only ever lasts a day or two in my apartment before my boyfriend eats it all. I add blueberries to the batter and make muffins instead of bread. It&#039;s the perfect grab-and-go breakfast!",,
2000167036,2886,2015-04-26,0,This is a good basic recipe for banana bread. I like to add rough chopped salted mixed nuts with raisins or chocolate chips. My husband likes raisins and I like the chocolate chips. Or just plain it is really good toasted and buttered.,,
2000170711,2886,2015-04-27,1,"Moist and well-defined banana flavor, but bland.  Only good if you haven&#039;t had good banana bread before.",,
2000170840,2886,2015-04-27,5,"This is by far my favorite recipe. Not just for banana bread, but in general. I love baking and this is my go-to. EVERYONE raves about it and it is so easy it&#039;s unbelievable. I like to put a layer of brown sugar on top before baking.. it gives it the PERFECT crust.. not too sweet but an amazing texture.",,
2000172287,2886,2015-04-28,5,Fabulous! Followed this recipe with one little tweak...I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Moist and full of flavor...delightful!,,
91584,2886,2015-04-28,5,"Wonderful banana bread recipe. I used 1/2 a cup of sugar and 1/2 a cup of Splenda with excellent results. Next time I will try all Splenda in place of the sugar. Also, I addes 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the recipe.",,
2000174873,2886,2015-04-29,5,Delicious! I only had three bananas so I added about a third cup of Greek yogurt and crossed my fingers hoping it would help keep the bread tasty and moist. Turned out great and I actually may prefer it with this modification too!,,
2000177548,2886,2015-05-01,5,"My 2 year old son loves to cook,BBQ,and now bake with me. It was simple enough that I was able to focus on him and having fun but had just the rite amount of everything to make a perfect loaf of our favorite bread. ideal balance of moisture,flavor,and density!",,
2000179973,2886,2015-05-02,5,"I&#039;ve only tasted the dough so far, but I&#039;m impressed! My banana bread dough doesn&#039;t usually taste this good. :)
I added cinnamon, too.",,
2000180738,2886,2015-05-02,0,"Basic Recipe is pretty good.  Some ways I altered it for the better:  Add walnuts and raisins.  Substitute 1/3 of floor for 1/3 of quick rolled oats.  Bake in 3 pans instead ot 2.
When looves come out of oven, make a series of even stabs with a fork over the entire surface of the lof top.  Smear slightly melted frozen orange juice concentrait (don&#039;t dilute it) over the surface.  The heat will cause the frozen orange juice to melt and go down the little punctures you have made.  This will be the glaze on the top, and add nice moisture and rich flavor.",,
2000181062,2886,2015-05-03,5,"my banana bread came out very spongy, soft and sweet! I blended all wet ingredients in my trusty blender. I slowly mixed in flour and lastly, mixed in the vanilla. Let settle for one minute and baked it for an hr. I served mine with vanilla bean ice cream! It was a hiiiiiit! Thanks.",,
2000181368,2886,2015-05-03,5,"Easy and nice for a rather healthy snack. I used brown sugar and a cup full seemed to make it too sweet. I&#039;d use 1/2 cup next time and see what happens. Maybe even less than that. Otherwise- great recipe, thanks! :)",,
98919,2886,2015-05-04,5,I just wanted a quick and easy banana recipe and this one was perfect! I threw it together in no time and it turned out delicious. I added largely chopped pecans. Will be a favorite from now on. Thanks for posting.,,
2000183257,2886,2015-05-04,3,"I wouldn&#039;t consider it the best recipe. The cook temp was a bit high, and it turned out a little dark for my tastes. The consistency in the center was fine, but the flavor was off. The best recipe is something that can be demolished before anyone else even had a chance.  : D  I&#039;m fine after one piece thanks...",,
2000185070,2886,2015-05-04,5,A very simple recipe but the result is delicious! Love it!,,

2000207498,2886,2015-05-16,5,"Great recipe. I made a lot of changes though and thought I should share. So, I only had 2 bananas so I googled banana replacements and found that Greek yogurt is a great substitute. I used 1/4 of a cup of the yogurt. I also replaced the butter with home made apple sauce with a little cinnamon in it.  I used brown sugar and half white flour and wheat flower. I also added dark chocolate chips and chopped roasted almonds. It was delicious!! I am ready to make it again!",,
2000209660,2886,2015-05-17,5,"Absolutely THE BEST banana bread recipe I&#039;ve ever tried! Very moist and a lovely light texture, so good. I added walnut pieces...mmmmm",,

2000219682,2886,2015-05-23,5,"Made this Gluten Free for my girlfriend who is celiac. I simply substituted 1 cup of Brown Rice Flour and 1/2 cup Corn Starch which I sifted together, for the 1 1/2 cups of All-Purpose Flour.  Turned out awesome, one of the best gluten-free breads I&#039;ve ever had.  Like others, I think I would fold in a 1/2 cup or so of Walnuts next time. It was very moist, and the top and edges had a great crunchy sweet taste. Also very good Banana flavor and very moist.",,

I have been using another recipe that was a little more work to do and my kids loved it, couldn&#039;t keep it around for more than a day.....and I would double the recipe. I decided to look for a more simple recipe and made this one. Kids love it even more, didn&#039;t know that could happen, lol. I did add a 1/4 of a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and I only had it in oven for 50 min. so I would start checking it at 45 mins. Great recipe, thx. IT&#039;S A KEEPER!! Oh, I also like mine with pecans or walnuts but didn&#039;t have any, will try that next time.",,

This last time, I used melted instead of softened butter and threw everything into one bowl.  Just stirred it up.  It was yummy!  I like to add applesauce to give it even more moist-ness.  Wonderful recipe!",,

2000186834,2886,2015-06-17,5,My new favorite banana bread recipe! The only thing this needs is one and one-half cup of pecan or walnut halves.,,
2000280928,2886,2015-06-19,0,This recipe pass if you like a traditional moist sweet banana bread. This recipe is bland.  It was bland and yucky.  I don&#039;t write recipe reviews but it was a waste of time and ingredients.  I did not leave any ingrediants out nor did I skip a step. I through it out . Batter tasted good but after it baked it was blah!!!,,
2000116512,2886,2015-06-20,5,Followed the recipe and added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1C of semi sweet chocolate chips.  Sooooo yummy. You will love it.  Great with Vanilla Ice Cream if you want to use for dessert.,,

2000292693,2886,2015-06-24,5,"There&#039;s already so many good reviews but I wanted to write one anyways because this recipe is sooo yummy! Made it last night and it tastes even better today. Instead of making a loaf I put the batter into a muffin tray and baked for 25 minutes but I suggest 30. I added chopped walnuts, sliced almonds, chocolate chunks and a bit of walden farms 0 calorie pancake syrup. I also substituted the flour for oatmeal that I blended up! I highly suggest this recipe! I&#039;m going to make it again and try stevia and quest protein powder instead of flour :)!",,

I accidentally adjusted it because I ran out of or didn&#039;t have certain ingredients. I used 3/4c sugar...much better, less sweet; I also used baking powder instead of baking soda because I didn&#039;t have any. I also used unsalted butter. All of these were based on lack of ingredients, but the substitutions made it terrific! Works terrific even if you double or triple it.",,
2000311954,2886,2015-07-03,0,"I mashed the bananas with a potato masher, so there were tiny chunks of banana, which is excellent.

1235507,2886,2015-08-09,5,"I have never written a review, however this was a MUST!!! This banana bread was so moist and delicious.  I had to use baking powder instead of soda so I added a half cup of sugar to compensate for the possible bitter from the powder.  I doubled the batch but only used 5 very ripe bananas.  This bread was perfect, buttery, moist and delicious.  Next time I will omit the extra sugar. I love the fact that it has no extra add ins, just banana and bread.

I forgot to take my overripe bananas out of the freezer in advance. I thawed them a bit in the microwave, but in the interest of time I ended up just pureeing them in the blender.

Next time I&#039;ll try adding blueberries. Enjoy!,,
31083,2886,2015-08-11,5,Very easy. I doubled the recipe and added chocolate chips to half and chopped walnuts to the rest. I made 8 mini loaves out of the doubled recipe and baked them for 40 minutes.,,

2000425692,2886,2015-08-24,0,What did I do wrong? The bread itself is yummy but it took 1hr 20 mins and still a bit too moist. Not the best banana bread recipe ever but still good :),,
2001032813,2886,2016-05-31,5,This is truly the best banana bread. Try adding nutmeg and cinnamon and you won't regret it,,
2000383101,2886,2015-08-25,5,"I tried this reciep last week and my friend 2yr old couldn&#039;t get enough. I love that it is  so basic and I don&#039;t need to refrigerate, cause there is none left to do so. It&#039;s painful to wait for cooking and cool down.
The 3rd time I replaced the butter with creamy peanut butter and decreased the sugar to 3/4cup, because I used Jiff, and their reaction was &quot;thats all you made?&quot; It was a triple batch.",,
2000435338,2886,2015-08-28,5,"I made this recipe tonight and I have to say, this bread is really good! I didn&#039;t add anything to it but I did use butter to coat the pan rather grease or oil and the outside of the bread tastes so good!!",,
2000436912,2886,2015-08-28,5,"i have tried making banana bread 6 times before trying this,(2 of those were mixes and all 6 of them failed),and i made perfect banana bread with this recipe ?",,
2000437312,2886,2015-08-29,5,Perfect banana bread! My first time trying this receipt. I consider myself an expert at making banana bread.  I love this recipe because it&#039;s very simple and effective. I made a few adjustments. I used salted butter to reduce the required amount of salt. I also used  half a cup of brown sugar and added less than a 1/4 cup dried canberries. And of course i added wallnuts.  My bread came out perfect!,,
2000441136,2886,2015-08-30,5,This recipe is the best banana recipe I&#039;ve found!,,
2000443401,2886,2015-08-31,5,Made as muffins and cooked for 20 minutes. Perfect,,
2000446832,2886,2015-09-01,5,"Recipe was great. Way better than the commericial ones i buy. I also added sunflower seeds, chopped walnuts and fresh blueberries. It tastes perfect! Unfortunately my bread was a little crumbly but other than that it&#039;s great.",,
2707017,2886,2015-09-06,5,"This was an excellent recipe!  Thank you for sharing.  I did it in a muffin form, baked at 360 for 20 minutes or so.  They are so moist!",,
2000456615,2886,2015-09-06,5,"I modified this recipe for a lower carb, lower sugar version. Sub half the flour with almond flour; use 2/3 cup of Splenda baking formula in place of sugar; and replaced half the bananas with no sugar added applesauce. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp ginger.",,

151991,2886,2015-09-10,5,"This is an excellent banana bread recipe. The bread comes out moist and holds together nicely. I&#039;ve made it following the recipe exactly and also by substituting half or all of the bananas with mashed pawpaw fruit. It&#039;s also excellent with black or English walnuts in it. If you use a convection oven, reduce the bake time to 45 minutes.",,
2000469077,2886,2015-09-12,4,"The flavor of this recipe was delicious! I used (really) old bananas from the freezer (like 3 months old), which was fine, but I think I should have split the recipe into two pans because there was a 4inch x 4inch cube of banana soup in the middle of the loaf. I had to eat around it b/c I couldn&#039;t put it back in the oven without burning the rest of it.

Hot tip: Generously sprinkle whole flax seeds on top of the loaf before baking! Gives it a fun crunch!",,
1802593948,2886,2015-09-13,5,This really is the best banana bread! Everyone loved it. I made three mini loaves which cooked for about 35 minutes.,,
2000480413,2886,2015-09-17,5,"As everyone states this is a very tasty banana bread and so easy to make, but I still messed it up a little, and here is how. The reason I made the bread was I had 6 bananas going bad in the refrigerator. They were very large and very soft. I followed the recipe exactly and after 45 mins in the oven the loaf liked like it was browning too much, so I thought it was done. I took it out and tilted it out of the loaf pan onto a wire rack. Well, about 5 tablespoons of liquid poured out of the top of the loaf.

After putting it back in the loaf pan and giving it another 15 mins on 350 it was great. The edges or outside pieces were crispy, and as you got more towards the middle it got softer and moist, and was to die for. Cooking is my thing not baking, so this recipe is really great for idiots like me who don&#039;t quite follow he cooking times and still want to recover.

After reading other reviews, I will however next time try brown sugar and cut back on the ripeness of the bananas. I also think raisins would go well with this recipe. Enjoy the aroma in your house as you bake this, it&#039;s wonderful.",,
2000481677,2886,2015-09-18,5,"My first banana bread! Brilliant!
I used bananas that were getting ugly that I had stuffed in the freezer for just a day like this.
I added walnuts, duh! 
The directions kinda made it seem like a smooth dough was essestial. I got it super smooth &amp; WOW.
We ate that loaf in two sittings! This will be the only BB recipe in our house. 
And, I&#039;m never gonna feed bananas to the chickens again!",,
2000488168,2886,2015-09-21,5,Super simple &amp; delicious...bursting with banana flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. This banana bread was a huge hit with my family...especially my husband!,,
599741,2886,2015-09-22,5,"This was darned tasty! Because bananas are so variable in size, my four bananas were probably a bit much, so that after an hour, the top of the loaf still looked too wet. I turned off the oven and left the loaf inside while I worked on other projects, checking periodically until it didn&#039;t shine. Then I covered it with a kitchen towel and let it cool on a rack on the counter, wrapped it in foil and refrigerated overnight.",,
2000494665,2886,2015-09-24,5,"YES! YES! YES!
I have never baked banana bread before, but I&#039;ve eaten heaps of them while living in Australia, and this tastes even better than I remember them! 
Easiest recipe ever, too. I only had two bananas, so I divided all measurements in two and added some pumpkin seeds for extra texture, and other than the height of the bread not being as in the pictures everything else was perfect, and the taste was of course YUMMY! 
Will save recipe and definitely make again!",,
2000492637,2886,2015-09-24,5,"Such a great banana flavour, great crust, amazing!

For my own spin, I did half brown sugar, half white sugar. Also, I added a cup of walnuts and chocolate chips because... Why not?! My cooking time ended up being closer to 50 minutes, so check at 50 minutes with a toothpick!",,

2000531519,2886,2015-10-06,4,So I used exact quantities and ingredients from the recipe apart from adding a dash of cream and chocolate chips.. but my bread actually rose out of my pan and is dripping down to the bottom of the oven. I picked up what I could while its baking and it tastes delicious hahaha but it keeps rising and crumbling out of the pan. Any solutions?,,
46165047,2886,2015-10-06,5,This bread&#039;s name is fitting.  I made a loaf the other day and took it to work.  Everyone said it was the best they ever had and asked for the recipe.  Now I&#039;m buying bananas just so they can over ripen and I can make some more!  Thanks for this great recipe.,,
2000539896,2886,2015-10-09,5,I&#039;d have to say this is the best banana bread recipe I&#039;ve made and I&#039;ve made mamy. The bread is very moist and tastes so good.,,
2000540873,2886,2015-10-09,5,Truly the best banana bread recipe ever.  Made it just like it says for a bake sale and had people coming back asking for the banana bread - sold out of it quick!  I could&#039;ve made just the banana bread and not bothered with cookies at the sale!!,,
2000541457,2886,2015-10-09,5,"Very simple and easy recipe that comes out delicious!   The only  change I made to the recipe is adding 1/2- 1 teaspoon ginger, 1/2- 1  teaspoon Chinese five spice and 1/2-1  teaspoon cinnamon.  More of a banana spice bread but very delicious",,

2000560248,2886,2015-10-14,5,"I plan on making this tomorrow but I&#039;d like to use agave nectar instead of sugar. Has anyone tried that? Web says to use 2/3 cup agave instead of 1 cup of sugar, and to reduce liquid by 1/4 cup. It would be blasphemous to reduce the amount of butter in the recipe, so I&#039;m thinking of either leaving out an egg or adding a little more dry ingredients... Maybe a little flax meal?",,

2000610229,2886,2015-10-27,5,"So I don&#039;t usually write reviews, but I really thought that this warranted one...
I&#039;ve tried so many banana bread recipes, but they have a trend of all losing their moisture very very quickly. I followed this recipe pretty much to a T, although I did 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar and added a bit of extra vanilla. Also, keep in mind this is a nice dense and moist bread, so if you like something super fluffy I wouldn&#039;t use this recipe. Anyways, this recipe is so beautifully moist and yummy, and if you haven&#039;t already, you need to try it!",,

I have been baking Banana Bread for years and have tried a number of recipes. I lost my  personal recipe book about a year ago when I took it to a friends house so I needed to look one up a couple of days before Thanksgiving and I came across this one. What caught my attention was the amount of bananas it called for. I made two loaves of it and they were gone in about 3 days and there were only four people at my house that weekend, myself included...lol. Yes...it was that good!!! Try it, you won&#039;t regret it.

I did use self rising flour instead of AP but only because I am too lazy to sift, and honestly I&#039;ve never been able to tell a difference in substituting one for the other. I baked for 50 minutes and a toothpick inserted had a little bit of goo so I just turned off the oven and let them sit inside for the next 10 minutes.

The only changes I made were white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and I added about 1/2 c of oat bran to it. It&#039;s fantastic, though maybe just a bit too sweet. The kids are all over it! I&#039;ll be making it again for sure",,
2000698426,2886,2016-04-22,5,"Yep!  Turned out perfect, looked like the picture and tasted even better.",,
2016381,2886,2016-05-01,5,This was so simple and amazing. I added a bit of shredded dark chocolate to kick it up a notch. Even without the chocolate it is sure to please.,,
2000999841,2886,2016-05-05,1,"This recipe is terrible! I had to cover the top of the loaf with foil after 45 minutes as it was starting to burn. After an hour, it was still wet in the middle. Left for a further 15 minutes until the cake tester came out clean. On turning out, the bottom half of the loaf remained in the tin! Just a disaster! I bake a lot and this is by far the worst result for my efforts- such a waste of ingredients.",,
2000337437,2886,2016-05-11,5,This recipe is really great! So much so that I have made this recipe 3 times this month. It's very moist and not overly dense like my old banana bread recipe which called for more flour and baking powder. I follow the recipe exactly and pour into a 9 x 9 glass pan and bake for 45 minutes. Today I made 1.5 times the recipe and used a 9 x 13 glass pan and it was also ready in about 45 minutes. I also used coconut oil instead of butter and it tasted just as good. This recipe is a keeper for sure!,,
2001010090,2886,2016-05-13,5,Best Banna Bread I've Ever Eaten! Instead of vanilla extract o added almond extract and it was the most delicious dessert I've ever eaten! My boyfriend and I ate both loaves in a day! We had to make MORE the next day! Delicious!,,
516341,2886,2016-05-14,5,"I have made and eaten a lot of banana bread over the years. This recipe is hands down one of the best that I have used. It was an instant hit with my family. I made one modification: I only use 2 bananas as we like a bread where the banana flavor is not too strong. Two bananas add the perfect amount of fruit flavor without being overpowering. Thanks, lkadlec for a fantastic recipe!",,
2001007948,2886,2016-05-14,5,I just made this but added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Hands down - the best Banana Bread I've ever made. My husband agrees.,,
2001014688,2886,2016-05-16,5,"Perfect recipe. The bread was so delicious and stayed moist for days. I did end up needing to add a few minutes of baking time for it to be fully done but that could change depending on the pan, climate, etc., So absolutely nothing to complain about. I will definitely be saving this recipe for future loafs of banana bread.",,
2001036110,2886,2016-06-03,5,This is honestly the BEST Banana Bread recipe I have ever made! My boys buy extra bananas at the store in hopes that I will make this every week! (I added walnuts as well!),,

First 12 normal recipe, then added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips for the second batch (so double that for the full recipe). Cooked at 350, checked with toothpick, 25 minutes total. Cooled on baking rack 1/2 hour. Made 24 total. Soft and moist, not gooey. Did not rise much at all, flat top not rounded. Both are very good, but I'm leaning towards the choc chip / cinnamon version.",,

1800068493,2886,2016-09-04,5,"I've tried a few recipes and I like this one the best. It is sweet but not too sweet that I can't eat it for breakfast, warm with a touch of butter. My husband has me add chocolate chips for him sometimes, but I much prefer it plain. It only makes one loaf, which is a lot of bananas for one loaf. But worth it. My husband isn't a big banana bread person and he will even eat this, chocolate chips or not.",,
2001067676,2886,2016-09-05,5,This is truly the best banana bread recipe. The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle a little brown sugar on the top before baking.,,

2001071403,2886,2016-09-14,5,"It was the first time I tried banana bread and this came out fantastic. Simple and perfect the first time. Alterations: I added walnuts to get some extra crunch. The baking soda we get in India is probably more potent, I used 1/2 teaspoon only with good results. Next time, I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 th cup too.",,
1477540,2886,2016-09-18,5,"Wow! I'm very impressed! Moist, full of flavor, few ingredients and easy! Finally the kind of banana bread I had hope for, just banana taste and no cinnamon or nutmeg overwhelming.

To do that, I halved the sugar content to half a cup and used rice syrup instead and replaced the wheat flour with spelt which is more nutritious. I've played around with replacing the butter with coconut oil and this works really well. Then tonight I made it again and used olive oil instead (1/4 cup + 2tbs) and only added 1/3 cup of rice syrup and threw in some choc chips too. It's the winning recipe so far!",,

2001293952,2886,2016-12-12,5,"This is such an easy recipe, perfect if you're in a hurry. It's delicious as well! I put in only 1/2 cup of sugar, that is plenty sweet enough, because the bananas have so much sugar in them anyway. Leave the butter in - it's healthy! Just don't use margarine:( My mother taught me to pat wet hands on top of the cake before you put it in the oven - the extra moisture makes the cake top lovely and crunchy.",,
2001294186,2886,2016-12-12,5,"In a recent move, I misplaced my old recipe file with my mother's banana bread recipe in it. I found this one and tried it, only to discover that it tasted exactly like my mom's! When I found the file box, I compared recipes, and they were identical, with the exception that my mom didn't put quite as much sugar in her banana bread. I love to make muffins and take them with me to work for a snack. Did you know my mom? Did she give you her recipe, too? This is a &quot;never can fail&quot; recipe!!",,
2788762,2886,2016-12-14,5,"Great and easy recipe. Followed recipe ingredients but doubled it. Made half into muffins and the other half into the bread adding chocolate chips and almond slices. My family ate the whole thing before I could get a picture. Perfect balance btw moist and light. Definite keeper, my new go to banana bread recipe.",,
2001299975,2886,2016-12-16,4,"So easy a six-year old can do it. I made this recipe with my son today. To be honest, I was drawn to this recipe due to it's simple ingredients and straightforward directions. We doubled the recipe and made two loaves based on the positive reviews...And plus, our family loves loves banana bread. We made two loaves from the doubled recipe: one as directed and one with walnuts. Our bake was a bit over (too brown), but we got two moist loaves. Not quite sweet enough for our tastes. However, it will still make a great partner to my morning coffee or my kiddos glass of milk. I'd suggest two adjustments: adding 1/3 cup sugar when doubling the recipe and reducing the bake time by 5-10 minutes. My son and I will definitely make this recipe again (with those minor adjustments).",,
2001306800,2886,2016-12-19,5,"My family and I agreed this was the best banana bread we'd ever had! And so easy to make. Only thing I changed was I used a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar. Also added some chocolate chips and chopped pecans, (about 1/2 cup each.) And before baking, I mixed three Tablespoons of brown sugar with one Tablespoon of water and brushed that over the top of the loaf. It gave it a nice crunchy topping. A tip I discovered when I realized I only had three super-ripe, blackened bananas and the recipe called for four. I took one of the yellow bananas, cut it into chunks and put it in a pan with a little water and sugar. Baked it at 350 for about three or four minutes. It was &quot;mushy&quot; and sweet, just like a super-ripe banana after I did that. Also, to ensure even baking of the entire loaf, it helps to put the loaf pan in a larger baking pan. Fill the larger baking pan with a few inches of water and put it in the oven for the recommended time. The center of the loaf will be totally baked and the outsides will not be overly dry.",,
2001295115,2886,2016-12-19,5,"The loaf wasn't even half gone and I was already getting requests to make more. Looks like this will be a staple around my house. A quick note that I changed one cup of white sugar to one half cup white sugar, one half cup light brown sugar. I also combined brown sugar and water for a crunchy topping and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of that. Absolutely divine!",,
2001307245,2886,2016-12-19,5,"This recipe was perfect and easy. The only changes I made was adding chocolate chips to the final mixture before pouring into the pan, and browning the butter in a skillet before creaming together with the sugar. Best banana bread I've ever had, hands down.",,
2001314377,2886,2016-12-23,0,Found this recipe and tried it. I had great results. I liked this recipe so much and found this it very easy and adaptable so I experimented with other ingredients and had great luck. I used grated up apples and added cinnamon. turned out great!!!,,
820939,2886,2016-12-23,5,WOW !! Best banana bread ever so moist!! I added 1 cup of walnuts but other then that it was perfect!,,
2764186,2886,2016-12-25,0,"I just made this Banana bread tonight Took some of the ideas of brushing the top with water / Brown sugar mixture...very nice... The huge issue, is that I did what Dog Mama suggested, and put the loaf pan into another pan with water, in hopes of getting a done centre but not dry top...well...that was a fail! The top is great, but the entire bottom 1/2 of the bread is totally raw!! Ugh! It was not evident when I did the toothpick test, since the loaf pan is deeper than the toothpick, it seemed perfect....OMG! Now it's cooling, and horrible and don't know how to fix it! :(",,
2001323555,2886,2016-12-27,2,Banana bread is way too wet! it turned out very mushy like mash potatoes... i'll find a better recipe,,
2001310888,2886,2016-12-27,5,Definitely awesome!!! Served as a dessert with raspberry glaze and vanilla ice cream.,,
2001323821,2886,2016-12-27,2,"Followed directions to a &quot;T&quot; and bread wasn't baked in the middle. I did use an aluminum bread pan so maybe that's why, but I was pretty disappointed. I put it back in and left it longer and it still wasn't cooked. End pieces were good though!",,
2001327638,2886,2016-12-30,5,"Ok, this was absolutely delicious, I mean if you want it to be extremely moist. I used a glass pan and 4 ripe but not over ripe bananas. I see what others are saying about the moisture, mine was fully baked crunchy and sweet crust but butter-like soft and extremely decadent and moist center. I loved it! Looks like a banana brownie lol I did tweak it a bit",,
2001328917,2886,2016-12-30,5,Made this banana bread this morning. Turned out wonderful. I just added walnuts and a tad of cinnamon. Will definitely make this recipe again.,,
2001212576,2886,2016-12-31,5,"Absolutely the best recipe out there. Simple too!! I added cinnamon only because I always add cinnamon too my banana bread. I baked it for exactly 1 hour at 350 degrees, it came out very moist with a nice crust. Holds together perfectly. I will always make this recipe.",,
2000988048,2886,2017-01-01,5,This recipe is amazingly delicious and moist! It's easy to make and turns out every time. I do fold in 3/4 cup chopped pecans and top with 3 tbsps finely chopped pecans before baking. Other then that I follow the recipe. Anytime my family sees very ripe bananas they ask me to make it.,,
2001336030,2886,2017-01-07,5,Delicious! Just wasn't cooked completely in center. Not sure if pan made a difference or something else. I used Temptations loaf pan and always love how they cook. Any ideas?,,
2001342156,2886,2017-01-08,5,My son and I just made this recipe today and we love it! So yummy and very moist! Since I did this with my lil guy he wanted some dark chocolate chips in it so we lessened the sugar too and voila still delicious! Next time I'll add some walnuts and cinnamon. Thank you for sharing this very simple recipe. Here it is fresh from the oven...,,
2001347987,2886,2017-01-13,5,Used 1/4 tsp Salt 4 Life (salt substitute) and 1/4 tsp kosher salt to reduce the sodium. Also used 4 bananas. Great!,,
2001350645,2886,2017-01-14,5,"I've used this recipe several times, and it always turns out fantastic- great flavor &amp; moist. I've used 3-4 bananas each time. Also added chopped walnuts &amp; chocolate chips. It's just me &amp; my husband that eat it, so most of the time I use the small loaf pans that come in sets of 4. Then I freeze them within a quart size freezer bag. So convenient. Thaws quickly &amp; is so delicious. Great recipe!",,
2001350955,2886,2017-01-14,0,"Made gluten free by using gf flour and added about 1/4 cup more flour plus,the 4 bananas. Turned out great in little loaf pans baked at 325 for 35 min",,
2001334624,2886,2017-01-14,5,I did not have any butter so I used oil. I didnt have any vanilla so I used vriwn sugar and it was absulutely amazing!!,,
2001353092,2886,2017-01-15,5,Very moist and very very very good!,,
2000516329,2886,2017-01-16,5,Seriously- best banana bread ever! I used 4 bananas.,,
2001355457,2886,2017-01-17,4,"Tried this recipe. Turned out fine, but not as good as the reviews had suggested. This recipe is definitely lacking flavour. More bananas would be a good choice. Perhaps a bit of cinnamon as well. It cooked thoroughly and tastes fine. My boyfriend enjoyed it!",,
2001118181,2886,2017-01-21,5,"Try sprinkling brown sugar over the batter after pouring it in to your loaf pan. The brown sugar will caramelize, adding a wonderful crunchy texture to the soft, moist (if you hate that word, sorry - help me find a synonym!) texture of the bread.",,
282302,2886,2017-01-21,0,Good morning. I don't have a loaf pan. Can you advise another size? I do have some mini disposable loaf pans. How far would I fill those?,,
2001361003,2886,2017-01-21,5,Best recipe ever !!!!!! Add a whole stick of butter !!,,
2001361303,2886,2017-01-22,5,Find a recipe and always tweak it and make it yours. I added extra bananas for flavor (extra ripe is sweet and you won't have to add all the sugar. I added 1/2 the sugar and it was still sweet). I also added a tbs. of cinnamon and walnuts. The best banana bread recipe ever! All of my coworkers loved it. Making more for Monday morning with coffee and tea.,,
2001364549,2886,2017-01-24,5,This is by far the best banana bread I have made. I also doubled the recipe and added a few milk chocolate chips and some pecan peices also made muffins!! Everybody loved them. I also added pumpkin spice.,,
2001364671,2886,2017-01-24,5,"The top quote is correct - this is the perfect starting point for banana bread. I took the author's advice and used 4 bananas. I also took the amount of sugar down to 1/2 cup. Instead of a loaf pan, I made 12 muffins, which needed 30 minutes in the oven. For variety, I put in half the batter, added walnuts, almonds, chocolate chips or ginger bits to each cup (just a bit!) and topped the cups with the rest of the batter. They were perfect!",,
536962,2886,2017-01-24,5,I added frozen blueberries and loved this!,,

2001376161,2886,2017-02-02,5,"This was my first time making banana bread and I'm so pleased with the outcome, almost tastes like my great grandmothers!

So I've been cooking it on that for 15 mins and it's going really dark on the top... do I turn it down? Highly doubt I'll get a response before it's either burnt or delicious ?? It just looks a bit too dark???",,
2001387644,2886,2017-02-11,0,Has anyone tried adding ground Chia or flax seed to the recipe?,,
2001388044,2886,2017-02-12,5,I substituted wheat free gluten free flour and 1/4 cup sugar. DELICIOUS!!!!!!,,
2001389833,2886,2017-02-13,5,This was amazing!! I've tried so many times to make banana bread and it always comes out yucky. In this recipe I used almond extract since I didn't have vanilla and it was a great compromise. I will definitely try with vanilla,,

2001133793,2886,2017-02-25,0,I must have done something wrong. Instead of doing a loaf I made muffins and well I had to take them out at 33 minutes or they were going to burn. There wasn't much flavor either. I think I might have over mixed them. Also the bananas I had frozen previously so that might have been the downfall. The muffins were super dark. Will try it again with fresh bananas and not over mix. I was super excited to try this recipe.,,
2001405576,2886,2017-02-25,5,Best Banana Recipe - moist and tasty. I added walnuts and chopped dates. You will love it too.,,

The bread turned out beautiful. It gets quite dark in oven, don't be fooled it's done, use a toothpick to test. The lower temperature and added time allowed the crust to become slightly crisp and the inside was perfectly done.",,

2001412248,2886,2017-03-01,5,"I've made this recipe several times, and it always comes out wonderfully! I always use four bananas and bake mine in a 9&quot; x 5&quot; loaf pan. I read online (elsewhere) that banana bread is best baked when an instant-read thermometer reaches 195&deg; to 205&deg;F in the center. For me, that takes between 60-75 minutes. I've had success with the recipe as written as well as swapping out the white sugar for brown and/or adding walnuts. Has anyone tried using maple syrup instead of sugar?",,

No change to the recipe because it is perfect just the way it is. After we devoured my first loaf, I baked 3 loaves for sealing and freezing. I cut them in half for sealing. When I take them out to thaw, a half loaf usually lasts 2-3 days. I am a sealing maniac... Love it for my baked goodies! The pots and pans reminder at the beginning of the recipe is priceless. ?",,

I had 4 over ripe bananas staring at me and just had to make something yummy instead of the usual freezing the bananas for smoothies. Not that smoothies are not yummy. Read most of the reviews and took note of some suggestions and tweaks. I used 1/2 c reg sugar, 1/4 c brown sugar plus 2 tbsp maple syrup. Also added 1/2 c coconut flour to replace 1/2 c APF. I wanted to follow the recipe to a T but was feeling a bit adventures and was happy with the result. Although it didn't rise as much as I hope it would, probably due to the added maple syrup? Or the coconut flour? What ever the reason, it still turned out great! Thanks for the recipe! Will surely make this again n again, maybe add nuts or choc chips next time?",,
2001421014,2886,2017-03-06,5,I'm making it now. Simple to make and the batter tastes awesome. Also the smell in my kitchen is just wonderful. I'm hoping it tastes just as good. I used 4 bananas. Just had some and it is banging. I'll definitely use this one from now on. I live in phoenix az,,

I enjoyed that one but found it a bit dense and heavy but also great. This one,however is my favorite. Its moist and flavorful. I follow it exactly although i have done 3.5 or 4 bananas. My issue is that the outside is very brown and on the well done side but the center is mush. Im thinking its mostly my oven but I have read some peoples reviews that say to bake longer. I dont know how i can do that without having it too brown. Anyway i love this one and recommend it as is. I added semi sweet chocolate chips the last 2 times, which makes it more decadent. Enjoy!",,

I could easily imagine it being just as good but wetter with four, and/or just as good but less sweet with less sugar. Or adding chocolate chips and making it into a true dessert. But this was just the perfect basic, classic recipe that I was hoping for. One to save and reuse for sure!",,
2001439713,2886,2017-03-16,5,I really like this recipe. I tweaked it a bit by adding 1/2 C of Sugar (granulated) and 1/2 C of dark brown sugar for a deeper richness. Delicious!,,

2001460761,2886,2017-03-28,5,I'm not a fan of bananas but I can't get enough of this recipe. I reduced the sugar to half a cup and added half a teaspoon of cinnamon and crushed walnuts. I once ran out of vanilla but it was still delicious. It works well with an 8x8 pa and muffin tins as well although you need to be careful not to overcook the muffins or they dry out,,
2001462240,2886,2017-03-29,5,This is a delicious recipe. Love making muffins for the kids and small loaves for friends. I also add a teaspoon of cinnamon.,,

2001479766,2886,2017-04-09,5,"I use a mini loaf pan. Keep an eye on it though. You won't need to bake as long. Also I add dark chocolate chips, blueberries, crushed walnuts, or any combination of those three. By using the mini loaf pan, they're so moist you dont even need to put butter on it. People love them!",,
2001486145,2886,2017-04-13,0,My son and husband absolutely loved this banana bread recipe! I too added dark chocolate chips! This will be my forever go to recipe to make for friends s and family. Forgot to add stars would give 10 but only five there to choose from!,,

2001502397,2886,2017-04-24,5,"I made them with 4 bananas. While they were moist, they were a little heavy/ dense. I think nuts are a must unless you're allergic. Very good and easy recipe! I'll definitely use it again! Made 6 large muffins.",,

I think it's a very good way to begin a recipe that uses the oven and I hope other recipe-posters begin to make it the first item of ingredients, as opposed to item one of the instructions as most bakers first turn on their oven so it is preheating while assembling the ingredients.",,

162086,2886,2017-04-28,5,"I doubled &amp; it made three perfect sized loaves. This was a nice change from the overly dense loaves I've been making the past few years.

2000956762,2886,2017-04-29,5,I used to be a cookbook addict until I realized that I can't remember where the best recipes were in which of my hundreds of books. So now I just search on the web and see what looks interesting. Not only was this my first hit but the &quot;remove pots and pans from the oven&quot; totally struck me because that is where I keep all my cookie sheets! LOL Tasted perfect!!! So nice to have a banana bread without cinnamon.,,
2001512980,2886,2017-04-29,0,I laughed so hard at the first instruction: remove odd pots and pans from oven! Surprised we weren't instructed to crack open the eggs and discard the shells ;-),,

2001515317,2886,2017-04-30,5,Yum!! Turned out great.. I don't like too sweet so I put 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup sugar so the sweetness is perfect!!,,
2001517428,2886,2017-05-02,5,"Fantastic! I used 4 bananas. I had to keep it in the oven for an extra 10 minutes. Used a 9x5 loaf pan, sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Wonderfully moist &amp; very favorable. Definitely going in my favorites.",,
2001518503,2886,2017-05-02,5,I have made this 4 different times and i always add 4 bananas which makes it better in my opinion and with 3 bananas with this 5th time we will see if its as good,,
2001518690,2886,2017-05-02,4,Was really good. I added 4 bananas because some reviews said it'd be more moist. However all it did was make it doughy in the middle no matter how long I baked it. So I definitely think you should stick to original recipe for sure. Really good!,,

2001520577,2886,2017-05-04,5,I didn't follow the recipe at all and added a bunch of superfluous ingredients. Thus I'm reviewing a recipe completely different from what is posted. Stop the madness!

2001544481,2886,2017-05-19,5,"Totally delicious,I stayed too the recipe, except someone put the vanilla away with almost nothing in the bottle. Mine was not as Brown as some pictures. Also the size of pan was not included in recipe",,
2001543880,2886,2017-05-19,5,I added chunky chocolate chips to mine. It is beautifully brown and smells divine. I am giving it as a gift so I had to resist but it seems super moist. Now I have to make another one for myself.,,
2001231567,2886,2017-05-20,5,"Very good the first day, stored the leftovers in the frig overnight. This morning the flavors are even more pronounced and way yummy. Excellent recipe. I used 3-1/2 bananas, added freshly pitted/chopped dates, (about 1/2 cup.) Had to bake a bit longer, (covered top with foil the last 10-15 minutes.) Next time I make this, my husband has requested the addition of coconut &amp; chopped pecans along with the dates. Bet it will be great that way too.",,
2001546172,2886,2017-05-20,5,I used a 9inch square glass pan. I had also added 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. Yummy!! Its smelled delicious and taser delicious too. ??,,
852513,2886,2017-05-20,5,"This is absolutely delicious. I love how simple it is too! I added 1/2 C chocolate chips and put course sugar with a sprinkle of cinnamon on the top of the bread, but honestly it would be great without it. It's an awesome recipe.",,

2001570505,2886,2017-06-05,5,So I swapped out brown sugar for white... used 4 nannas and added a stick of cream cheese and folded in crasins. Off the Hook YUMMY! - Perfect!,,

I have also added walnuts, chocolate chips, M&amp;Ms, etc. and they all taste great. Personal favorite is with walnuts, followed by the 'just the bananas' version. My final version of this has only two small changes. Since I use 4 bananas, I cut the sugar back to 2/3 cup. And I use 1/3 cup white sugar, and 1/3 cup turbinado sugar. I like the flavor of turninado sugar, but all turbinado leads to a too dark loaf.",,
2001548806,2886,2017-05-22,5,Loved it! I added 4 super ripe small bananas instead of 3. It's nice and moist and very simple.,,

When I got home my husband and children complained that I didn't make enough..so I made them again today..the recipe yield 1 dozen.. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written ..I used 4 bananas. It was great..but like everyone else I tweaked the recipe and turned out even better (so my 11 y/o food critique daughter said anyway ??)",,

I couldn't find my recipe card so I looked on line and found this one. I'll never use another banana bread recipe! I made a double batch and used 8 bananas instead of 6.

2001571070,2886,2017-06-06,4,I did everything right except I forgot to remove the odd pots and pans out of the oven beforehand. It was hard to get out and I burned myself on a meatloaf casserole I'd been baking since last Tuesday. Why does this always happen to me? The recipe was okay otherwise I guess.

I used 1.5 cups + 3 tbs of sifted cake flour added 1/2 tsp of baking powder 1 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp all spice 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract 1/2 c. packed brown sugar + 1/4 cup white sugar Mixed the wet stuff just to combine gently with a whisk Mixed in the dry ingredients until just combined Sprayed standard loaf size (9x5?) pan with cooking spray and baked first for 40min to check, then an extra 15-20min for a total of about 60min, covered it with foil the last 10min It came out very well.

2001250784,2886,2017-06-19,5,Best banana bread I've ever made. I thought my Grandmother's? was the best but this tops it. I did add walnuts only because I didn't have any pecans. Follow the recipe and use 4 bananas if you have them. Sounds like a lot but was PERFECT!,,
2052576,2886,2017-06-19,4,This recipe is great - my only issue is that the finished product is very sweet. I'll cut the sugar in half next time. I made this with bread flour and only had two bananas on hand and it still turned out perfectly. Would taste great with walnuts.,,

I didn't have any butter on hand so I substituted for the same amount of canola oil. I used half brown sugar, half organic white sugar. I used four very ripe bananas, and added a dash of cinnamon. The result is very moist and delicious banana bread. It baked for about 45 minutes instead of the 55 minutes required on the recipe as I saw that the bread was already browning quite a bit. Highly recommend this recipe. Will definitely make again!",,

Anyway, hopped onto Google and did some research and came across this recipe. All I had to buy was baking soda to get going and when the bread was done, it tasted delicious! The bread was golden, soft and very moist! This recipe is definitely a keeper. You won't be disappointed. Easy to make within 10 minutes.!

Also, I used margarine instead of butter because historically for me, margarine keeps things moist. I also added a streusel topping (white sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon, water) and that created a good crunch on top. I also used 4 bananas. I think next time, I will add some cinnamon to give it a little more flavor. With my family of 4, we devoured the whole loaf in 1 day!",,

2001624828,2886,2017-07-13,4,"Good recipe. This was my first time making banana bread, and it was a success! The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sweetness. I took the tweaks into consideration and only used half a cup of sugar and it was still very sweet, not too sweet for me. However, I can't even imagine how sweet it would be with a whole cup of sugar. I might even use a quarter cup of sugar next time. Using 4 bananas is a MUST in order to achieve that moist, fluffy interior with a crusty outside. I only had two fresh ripe bananas, but I always save my ripe bananas in the freezer so I took two frozen bananas out and thawed them in a bag on the counter until they were completely thawed. Don't be frightened by the texture of the defrosted bananas; they are mushy and liquid-y (maybe a little brown, too). I mashed them in with the fresh ripe bananas and my bread still turned out great! Also, I added a few shakes of cinnamon and chocolate chips because, what is banana bread without chocolate chips???",,

With my past experience banana bakery's really turn out very sweet, so I reduced the amount of sugar and the taste is perfect for me. The sweetness doesn't hit the nerves. Also, I kept it for 50 minutes but still the top burnt a bit. I kept it at 178 deg C ( approx 350 deg F) hence I feel the temperature should be around 175 deg C. And yes, I added walnuts too! It tastes good :)",,
2000017771,2886,2017-07-21,2,"I seem to have found the one thing that will ruin this recipe: whole wheat flour. The bread turned out moist with a great texture; it just doesn't taste like anything, even though I used 4 bananas (3 thawed very ripe and 1 starting to age)",,
2001626559,2886,2017-07-21,5,"I feel a bit bad because I used this recipe as a bit of an experiment. But I had bananas hanging around that needed using, so I figured, what the heck. I've been trying to make things healthier, so the first thing I did is use oil instead of butter. The same amount. After measuring my oil I always put the measuring cup upside down in the tin, let the excess drip off and use that to grease my baking tin with. I didn't use sugar. Instead I used a stevia and brown sugar baking blend I'd picked up, and used half a cup. Its twice as strong as sugar though, so I didn't reduce the sweetness and for my taste it was perfect, though I can see why some might say its too sweet. I also didn't use eggs, I didn't have any in the house. But on my last healthy food shopping binge I brought ground flaxseed, and used that instead. I also threw in some raisins that I'd soaked in a little bit of bourbon, mostly because I knew my boyfriend would be tasting it and he'd appreciate the booze. I found I liked it too! It wasn't boozy tasting, just delicious. The finished loaf was delicious, though I did have issues with it being squidgy in the middle. However with my changes I can't be sure that its the recipe's fault really. It doesn't taste raw though, more just gooey like a brownie, for example. And it feels naughty even though I think its fairly healthy! Apologies to the author though, for taking such liberties with their recipe, though thank you for giving me another regular bake! :)",,

2001727920,2886,2017-09-24,4,"Overall, very tasty! I halved the recipe because I only had 2 bananas and I also turned them into mini-muffins! I followed the directions for everything except turning it into a loaf. I cooked them at 350 for about 13 minutes. They were super tasty fresh out of the oven. My half a recipe made 10 mini muffins. The only drawback was the greasing and flouring the tin because some of the flour made the outside of the muffin taste odd. They're pretty good, though, thanks for the recipe!",,
2001728908,2886,2017-09-24,5,"My three year old has celiacs and an esophagus disorder which results in a very limited diet. We are top 6 allergy free (no wheat, eggs, dairy, soy, nuts or seafood) so I am always substituting ingredients. For the banana bread I used earth balance &quot;butter&quot;, bobs red mill gluten free baking flour and egg replacer and it turned out fabulous. My daughter requests it all the time and she hugged me and said it is the best food I make her! Thanks for making this momma's heart happy! My husband and I also love it. Had it at a party and it was a hit. No one knew it was allergy friendly!!!",,

2001732867,2886,2017-09-28,5,"Added little cinnamon and brown sugar few spoonful , I would reduce sugar if banana are very ripe like mine, they are sweet already . Added extra butter half stick that made loaf very moist and crust little different. Test really good ...",,

2001737055,2886,2017-10-01,5,"Love this banana bread! It was SO easy to make. I used the 'moister method' and used 4 bananas and also added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. SO GOOD!! The ONLY problem was that the recipe says 55 minutes and the 'page' said 1 hour and 5 minutes. I split the difference and baked it for 60 minutes. I should have just went for 55 minutes. The bottom was a bit overdone, but that certainly didn't affect the flavor!! I will make this again.... soon!!!!",,

2001751027,2886,2017-10-13,5,"Sooo moist and dense yet light and soft at the same time. Definitely add the fourth banana, when I made it I actually added 5 very very ripe bananas. Top it off with some fresh chopped walnuts and sprinkle brown sugar before putting it in the oven it's literally the best finish. (also bakes totally great in a 7x11 pan if you don't have a loaf pan)",,

Metal loaf tin: exactly like the recipe says - 175'C 55 mins. Foil mould: 165'C 40 mins. Cupcakes: 165'C 20 mins. I use 4 medium bananas and 3/4 cup of sugar. My favourite cake to make thus far, since I started baking 3 months ago :) no mixer required :))",,
2001759042,2886,2017-10-20,5,"I used 4 bananas, which made for a rich bread. Butter was unsalted, so 1 t of butter would have been better. Grinded sea salt over the top while cooling. Delicious!",,

So I quickly thought, ummm I put 1 Tbsp &amp; 1/2 in small dish, 2 Tbsps Brown sugar and about 1/2 C chopped walnuts. Mixed together &amp; put in microwave 40 secs.

2001766903,2886,2017-10-26,5,Absolutely delicious. I used 4 bananas that I had in the freezer (makes the best banana bread). Used 1/2 cup of Brown Sugar. And squirted about 2-3 TBS of pancake syrup. I didn't have walnuts so I crushed up a 1/2 cup of almonds. After I poured the batter in the loaf pan. I sprinkled with brown sugar and almonds. It's amazing!!!!!,,

2001770215,2886,2017-10-29,0,"I put rasains in mine, instead of nuts. I soak the rasains overnight in rum. But, no worries if you don't want alcohol, it evaporates off during cooking. Or could use rum extract. Gives it a nice kick, bit moist though, if you like it that way.",,
2001771463,2886,2017-10-29,5,"Combined 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium-large bowl. Melted the butter in a separate bowl in the microwave, then added the cup of sugar, stirred, then microwaved another 10 seconds to dissolve the sugar a bit more. Separately, beat the two eggs in a bowl with a whisk, then added the four mashed bananas to the eggs, then added the butter/sugar and the vanilla. After that was all mixed up, I poured the mixture into the flour bowl and stirred until combined. Baked in a bundt pan. Delicious. Next time, will add some stuff - coconut, walnuts, pineapple, maybe? Thanks for the recipe!",,

2001776042,2886,2017-11-03,5,"Super good. The best. I would use 4 banana's. It does make a difference. Don't mix the banana's too much. Slightly lumpy is better. I have added blueberry's (so only 3 banana's), walnuts and chocolate chips. This isn't too sweet either. This recipe is a find!!",,
2001779573,2886,2017-11-05,5,"I used frozen bananas for this - thawed four for about 30 minutes, then mashed them to paste with the mixer. Removed and cleaned the bowl and followed the recipe as written. Worked a treat - the flavor is great, but you'll need amendments if you like more texture. Next time I'll test with dried/reconstituted fruit and chopped nuts.",,

2001847579,2886,2017-12-09,4,"Mine turned out dense and a little too moist in the middle but was DELICIOUS! By the next day it seemed to have settled a bit.

2001905595,2886,2018-01-01,4,"Full cup of sugar seemed too much. I'll cut it back to 3/4 cup next time. Otherwise, great with three bananas, which seemed to &quot;float&quot; to the top. Very mushy at the crown area.",,
2001906366,2886,2018-01-01,5,Awesome!,,
2001907945,2886,2018-01-02,1,"“55 minute bake time”... except mine was UNDERCOOKED by a long shot! I followed the directions to a T, and even let the banana bread sit in the oven for a few extra minutes the first time it was in the oven. The next day, I noticed more and more sections were completely uncooked. So, I rebaked the banana bread, and almost 30 extra minutes later I got what is photographed. Please use all your tools when checking if food is done. I am trashing this. Even an hour and a half bake-time is not enough time to bake this... why would this recipe say “55 minutes”? How can this be the number one recipe on google when mine turned out the way it did? I cannot be the only one with this problem.",,
2001907999,2886,2018-01-02,5,Smells and tastes AMAMZING ! I added some cinnamon before the oven and chocolate kisses after baking ... Mmmmmm!!,,
2001909771,2886,2018-01-03,5,"I made this with only half a cup of sugar, and sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on the top. Also added some nuts. Delicious!",,
44964343,2886,2018-01-03,5,I made this exactly as written. Amazing moist true banana bread. Thank you!,,
2001910577,2886,2018-01-04,0,I made this wonderful recipe today and I must say it came out beautifully. I had 7 bananas so I doubled the recipe and added brown sugar but it came out great. I wish I was more liberal with the white sugar on top and a dusting on the bottom but I like a sweeter tooth than the family so I made it to their liking.,,
2001912077,2886,2018-01-04,0,Substitute butter with applesauce. Less calories and tastes great!,,
1103722,2886,2018-01-04,5,VERY GOOD! And simple too! I normally make a recipe as written and do any tweaks later. I'm glad I did this time because it's great as written but I will add nuts next time and it will be even more delicious for my family's taste!,,
2001912538,2886,2018-01-05,5,Very easy and delicious.,,
2001912693,2886,2018-01-05,5,"I loved this recipe! Super simple and fairly quick to make. I added almonds and a TSP of Nutmeg for that extra flavor and it turned out great. However I found that if I use 4 bananas in the mix, the loaf will take about 1 hour and 25-30 mins rather than 55. It came out super moist and I can’t wait to make this again!",,
2001913569,2886,2018-01-05,5,"This is my go to recipe. Has been for years. Everyone loves it. My husband is allergic to wheat, dairy, and vanilla so I substitute brown rice flour, coconut oil, and maple syrup. I also use 4 over-ripe bananas. Thank you for sharing!",,
2001914598,2886,2018-01-06,5,"I’ve made this a couple of times and it’s always came out great! We like things extra sweet in our house, so I add a bit of powdered sugar I’ve rthe top when serving, and sometimes I’ll put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. It keeps well too!",,
2001918227,2886,2018-01-07,5,It turned out so yummy! i made a few tweaks. I added and extra egg along with buttering and patting brown sugar onto the bottom and sides of the pan. I also cut the bananas into chips and placed them onto the top following it with sprinkling more brown sugar and cinnamon.,,
2001918653,2886,2018-01-07,5,My go-to! Always turns out so delicious...I get requests to make it often. Simple and fast!,,
2001919076,2886,2018-01-08,5,My favorite recipe. The only thing I substitute from time to time are the eggs. Sometimes i used extra bananas in place. It’s a very delicious quick and easy recipe. I love putting sliced almonds on top.,,
2001920389,2886,2018-01-08,5,Very tasty recipe on its own. My kids will be so happy to gobble this up when they get home from school today!!,,
2001921137,2886,2018-01-09,0,Can you make these as cupcakes,,
2001921461,2886,2018-01-09,5,"By far the best and easiest recipe for moist delicious banana bread, I didn’t really do any tweaking to the recipe just added pecans and chia seeds. It was still kinda wet it the middle after 55 minutes so I added another 5 minutes and it came out great. The kids ate half of it before it was even cooled down! I will be making this again and again! Now I need to go buy more bananas!",,
2001921473,2886,2018-01-09,0,This bread was awesome. I added some chocolate chips (not a lot) and it was so yummy! Very easy to make!,,
2001921697,2886,2018-01-09,1,Not sure what I did but 55 minutes resulted in an over cooked cake and it did not rise. The only tweak I made was to add 1/2 cup of Craisins. This is my first fail with banana bread and I'm very disappointed. Only saving grace is my husband likes burnt toast and he said he will eat this 'burnt cake - he is not a cake eater usually!!!,,
2001921146,2886,2018-01-09,0,I used 4 bananas and it was dry not the best recipe,,
2001922050,2886,2018-01-09,4,the second time I made this I added a toffee pecan topping - SO delicious!!,,
2001836185,2886,2018-01-10,5,"I have used this recipe several times and it is the best one so far, The only thing I add is a few shots of Banana liquor, it gives it a little more Banana taste and it makes it a little moister.",,
2001893060,2886,2018-01-10,5,Oh My Gooness this is the best recipe. We all raved about it!!!!!! I added the four bananas( very moist) and I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead. Thank you to whom ever developed this recipe :-) Terry.C,,
2001925944,2886,2018-01-11,4,"Good, but a little sweet for my tastes. I used the 4 bananas.",,
2001926892,2886,2018-01-12,0,Still in the oven but I didn't use butter I used vege oil,,
2001927249,2886,2018-01-12,5,Seriously the best banana bread you will ever have. So moist and yummy. I got so many compliments on it!! I only baked it for about 45 minutes and it was perfect. Definitely wouldn’t do the whole 55. :),,
2001927723,2886,2018-01-12,5,Made this on the fly and it turned out amazing!! Seriously best banana bread ever. I added chocolate chips for a bit of chocolate flavor and it tasted great. Highly recommend! It actually reminds me of the bread on the road to hana in maui.,,
2001931573,2886,2018-01-14,5,"Best Banana Bread Ever! I finish the top off with crushed walnuts and brown sugar. I also add 1 teaspoon of Vanilla and 1 teaspoon of Cinnamon to the recipe. In the oven as I write this, make it every Sunday.",,
2001931884,2886,2018-01-14,5,"Followed the recipe, turned out great!! Best banana bread I've ever made!",,
2001920587,2886,2018-01-15,5,Amazing ! I used gluten free flour instead of regular flower and Himalayan salt instead of regular salt. Also. I didn’t know what they meant by “oil” didn’t know what type of oil to use. So I used used a little more butter then what was called for. I absolutely loved it. I followed the rest. I found that it was ready in 35 Mins instead of 55 Mins. Probably because of the gluten free flour I used. Loved it. So yum,,
2001934101,2886,2018-01-15,4,"It was too sweet with 1 cup of sugar, reduce sugar to 3/4th cup. I added half cup of pecans.",,
2001938773,2886,2018-01-18,5,Made it tonight and it turned out Amazing! Almost too good! I added chocolate chips to the inside and walnuts to the top.,,
2001939492,2886,2018-01-18,5,"Excellent, used 4 Bananas ??",,
1800176478,2886,2018-01-20,5,Mine turned out perfect. I used 4 bananas and a pinch of cinnamon. Mmmm,,
2001942696,2886,2018-01-20,5,I usually don't like it very sweet so I opted to use 1/2 cup of sugar only but used 5 pcs of bananas and turned out just as I wanted it.. love the recipe!!,,
2001943996,2886,2018-01-20,0,iss iitt good,,
2001944418,2886,2018-01-21,5,It added nutmeg and cinnamon to my first batch. It was so good.,,
2001872031,2886,2018-01-21,5,We made it with 4 bananas and it was awesome! Everyone loved it!,,
2001944763,2886,2018-01-21,5,Yum! Was looking for a recipe to use up a bag of gooey bananas and tried this. I made two batches - one with crushed walnuts through it and the other with choc chips in it. Both went down so well that I am now being given gooey bananas by workmates in the hope I'll make more! Thanks,,
2001944953,2886,2018-01-21,5,True to recipe title! Best banana bread recipe!! Real keeper!,,

2001947026,2886,2018-01-22,5,First time making banana bread and it turned out delicious.,,
2001947989,2886,2018-01-22,5,"I always come back to this recipe! I've made it with so many variations and it's always a hit. I've got gluten free muffin versions in the oven right now, used 5 bananas. Last time I made it, I got a skeptic thinking it was a store bought bread. ?",,
2001950492,2886,2018-01-24,0,Best recipe I have found! Easy and quick. I did add chopped pecans. Very moist!,,
2000558056,2886,2018-01-24,5,"I searched Google for &quot;the best banana bread recipe ever,&quot; and they were right on the money. I had four really ripe bananas begging to be used, and it was amazingly moist and flavorful. I didn't cut into it for almost two hours after taking it out. At first I thought it was underdone, but it was this incredible banana layer on the bottom. Absolutely the best I have ever tasted. I used Einkorn flour and Swerve sugar replacer. I had only one egg, so I threw in a dash of baking powder. It took nearly 1 1/2 hours to bake, but it was well worth it.",,
2001842902,2886,2018-01-24,0,This is wonderful!! Extremely moist and delicious.,,
2001952648,2886,2018-01-25,5,Finally a perfect Banana Bread Recipe! Didn’t change a thing (except lay foil over top at 30 minutes in to prevent over-browning) even though I am at high altitude. Husband LOVED it!,,
2001953392,2886,2018-01-25,5,Delicious and so moist. Use at least 2 bananas and three is perfect.,,

2001957150,2886,2018-01-27,5,"moist and delicious! I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, then I sprinkled top with some raw sugar before baking",,
2001957026,2886,2018-01-27,5,Delicious!!!!!! I put in chocolate chunks and it tasted even better!,,
41934643,2886,2018-01-28,0,"this is delish. I subbed with 1/2 wheat flour and half honey for the sugar and with those healthier subs it was still serious yummy, rich and almost caramel-ly!? (maybe from the honey) I also added a glob of sour cream. My only issue was it got really brown and crusty around the edges while the top center was still mushy so idk next time if I make it in a bigger pan so it not so deep maybe it will cook more evenly?",,
2001959761,2886,2018-01-28,0,Is it 350 or 180? Is one Celsius? Why not specify?? It's unclear.,,
1161473,2886,2018-01-29,5,Very easy to make. I cut back on the sugar to 3/4C just due to personal preference. Very light which I prefer to a denser bread.,,
2001962336,2886,2018-01-30,5,"Followed the recipe to a T and then added some walnuts. This is by far the best banana bread recipe I have ever made. Sweet, light, not heavy like most, and very moist, even though I only used 3 bananas. This was better then my moms recipe! Sorry mom! Oh, and it’s a very simple recipe also.",,
2001963588,2886,2018-01-30,5,very good! i added more bananas,,
2001963629,2886,2018-01-30,5,"Added walnut and cinnamon great bread and super easy. FYI I used whole-wheat flour, sugar in the raw and home-made extract and everything came out perfectly. ??",,
2001963542,2886,2018-01-30,5,Just made this today and it was delicious! I added walnuts though. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.,,
2001974309,2886,2018-02-04,5,"I made four loaves total. One was plain banana bread, two were chocolate chip banana bread, and the last one was peanut butter chocolate chip banana bread. All for of my kids and my coworkers loved them!",,
2001975223,2886,2018-02-05,4,"I made them into a dozen muffins, and only baked for 35minutes. Came out moist",,

75407,2886,2018-02-05,5,This is the EXACT recipe that my Grandma used and gave to me when I looked at her recipes as a teen girl and putting them in myope chest. That was about 35 years ago! My husband will not eat another banana bread!,,
2002019632,2886,2018-02-27,5,"Awesome recipe. This was my first bake and it came out really good and moist, it's not too sweet either, just the way I like it.",,
2001978657,2886,2018-02-07,0,This is a simple and delicious recipe! I used 3 bananas and added the vanilla. I also cooked it longer than the suggested time. I added six minutes cooking time and also left it in the oven with it off for about ten minutes. It significantly changed the color; however it was very not done when I checked it just before the estimated cooking time. It's a little crunchy on the outside and perfect on the inside. :),,
2001980242,2886,2018-02-08,5,"I wanted to make something for my friends for Valentines, so I doubled the recipe, used 7 bananas and the vanilla. It made enough to fill 5 mini loaf pans! I baked it for 58 minutes. For my first try I think it came out great!",,
2000641345,2886,2018-02-08,5,"Great recipe! I had been making the same banana bread recipe for awhile and was in search for a new one. The old recipe only had 3 tbsp of butter, while this one has 1/2 cup. Wow, it makes a difference! I used 4 bananas and sprinkled cinnamon in the batter. Delicious!",,
2001981171,2886,2018-02-08,5,These turned out great and are perfect for my child's classroom snack. All his classmates loved them! Making another batch for snacktime tomorrow.,,

2001985993,2886,2018-02-11,5,"I followed the recipe to a T, with three bananas, and it was hands down the best banana bread I've ever had. Instead of making a loaf, I made muffins. Same temp for 22 mins and they were perfect!",,

2001973032,2886,2018-02-11,5,"As I am at high altitude, I had to bake this for 12 minutes longer and it was perfect. I also added chopped dates. Great recipe with wonderful texture and taste. Highly recommend.",,

2001535691,2886,2018-02-16,4,I substituted 1/2 c.of almond butter for the 1/2 of butter.I might try peanut butter next time. Although it might be way too strong of a flavor... I substituted 1/2 c of applesauce and 1/2 c honey for the 1 c. of sugar. My husband even thought it was good.,,

2001994547,2886,2018-02-16,5,"Followed recipe to include the optional vanilla extract...bread loaf was moist, soft and fluffy. I also poured batter into two loaf pans instead of one so that it wasn’t too dense and thick when finished.",,
2001994459,2886,2018-02-16,4,"Not sure about this recipe so far. Why not add baking powder instead of baking soda? Baking soda and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt seems it would make it salty. Also, there doesn’t seem to be enough flour to wet ingredients. Very dubious to how this will turn out as the batter is very soupy. **UPDATE** Turned out fine. The taste was very banana-y and texture moist. The only problem was turning it out of the loaf pan as the bottom stuck despite having been buttered and floured. I used a glass loaf pan.",,
2001997190,2886,2018-02-18,5,"I've been using this recipe for years, but now I started to add to mine. Here's some optional for your bread: Add blueberries and grounded flax seeds. Banana and nuts.

2001997955,2886,2018-02-18,5,Ba-nan-a-mazing!! I have tried many recipes and this by far is the best yet! The constancy was perfect. I used 4 bananas as that is what I needed to get rid of and the flavor was perfect and moist. This one is a keeper. ??,,

Since the protein powder is sweet, I only added 1/2 cup sugar. I used olive oil for the butter. I also added cinnamon. This meant I had to reduce the cooking time to 35 minutes.

2001996084,2886,2018-02-22,5,"Awesome banana bread recipe! This is replacing my grandmother’s that I’ve been using for years. I made this on a whim with my 11 year old son. I chose it because it was a nice basic recipe without too many frills or ingredients to add. I was lazy and used the muffin method (dry in one bowl, wet in another, then mix together gently and bake) and it still turned out excellent. Everyone was raving about the flavor. Less is definitely more here! No need for spices and extra vanilla, no buttermilk or sour cream or yogurt tang, just straight up banana flavor shining through! Moist, not overly dense. Highly recommend!!! Also, the first instruction to “remove odd pots and pans from the oven”, priceless! That happens to me all the time. Glad I’m not the only one....",,
2002006292,2886,2018-02-22,5,Went with three bananas. Added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Took 68 min on a KithchenAid propane stove. But looks great!,,
2002008025,2886,2018-02-23,5,Excellent simple recipe! A family favorite. I use 4 bananas and add the vanilla. While cooling I wrap in a plastic bag to caramelize the exterior. Fabulous every time!,,

2002027318,2886,2018-03-03,5,Great easy recipe. I only had self raising flour. Came out fab also added chocolate chips!,,

2001932976,2886,2018-03-05,3,"Certainly NOT the last banana bread recipe that I’ll ever need. I made this bread yesterday. First, cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup at MOST. Second, stick with 3 bananas. 4 makes a very packy gummy bread even when cooked to 200 degrees F internal temp. Which leads me to Third, you need to specify an internal temp when cooked. Fourth, add more salt! Bland, bland, BLAND! Fifth, could you include cooling instructions? Too bad this recipe stops short of the promise to be the last one needed. Glad I’ve got more bananas to test another recipe.",,

I added 2 servings of unflavored protein powder, olive oil (5 tbsp) in place of butter, raisins, dark chocolate chips, pecans, and spenda in place of sugar. I also made these as cupcakes = easily portable for kids lunches :-) They turned out excellent. If you make cupcakes make sure to bake them for 30 minutes instead of the length of time you need for a loaf. Thank you for posting this recipe.",,
2001833767,2886,2018-03-06,4,"Too sweet when I followed the recipe exactly, Most people not realize you can halve sugar in baking muffins, loaves etc. I did just that the second time and it was perfect. I also added walnuts as banana bread needs it!",,
2002058337,2886,2018-03-17,3,It isn't my favorite recipe. The flavors good. Had to cook an extra 14 min to get it cooked all the way.,,
2002035072,2886,2018-03-07,5,I am baking this for the 5th time as I type! Great recipe...moist and delicious. I add only 3/4c. sugar (brown) and a touch more salt along with the 4th banana and walnuts. It turns out perfectly every time.,,

2002036300,2886,2018-03-07,5,Love this recipe and love banana bread! I added the vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of bread before baking. The cinnamon sugar goes well with the banana flavor! Try it!,,
852436,2886,2018-03-09,5,"I have made countless banana bread recipes over the years, and I bake a lot. This recipe, will end my search for a simply delicious banana bread. I was hesitant to try it because it has so few ingredients. What? No sour cream? No yogurt? This cannot be that good. Boy was I wrong. Do yourself a favour and try it. Just trust me on this one. I added walnut and that upped the flavour a tad although, it really didn't need it.",,

2001924895,2886,2018-03-11,0,This sounds delicious! I'm wondering if anyone's tried it with less butter and sugar than recommended. Or is it as good as it is because it has so much sweet and buttery goodness?,,
2001818660,2886,2018-03-11,0,"Dear Anna; I use margarine instead of butter just because I don't have to wait for it to get soft. I also use Splenda instead of sugar since we have a diabetic in the family, they are not as sweet but may family and friends like them and there are never leftover. but my signature tweak is pecan and coconut flakes, no measuring, just a handful each, bake as muffins instead of loaf and kids love them.",,
2002043703,2886,2018-03-11,5,"I doubled the recipe , used brown bananas (6) , it turned out really moist and sweet but not to sweet. I want to try using brown sugar next time instead of white. Good simple recipe tho. Will definitely be making it again.",,

However, recently I have been eliminating eggs and dairy from my diet. I replaced the butter with coconut oil exactly and the two eggs with a half cup unsweetened applesauce with a teaspoon of baking powder. It came out delicious, obviously the texture is a little different but no sacrifice in taste. No one even realizes it’s vegan!",,

Oh, and an extra egg, but only the egg white. Perfect, moist, great flavor. For muffins, put in the oven for 15 minutes for perfection.

163721,2886,2018-03-19,5,"Turned out perfectly. I followed the directions given with one exception, I used brown sugar, vanilla bean paste and added pecans. I also used 4 medium bananas that were ripened to almost black. Yum!",,
2001942598,2886,2018-03-19,5,This recipe is delicious and was a big hit with my family. I used 4 bananas to ensure a moist and very &quot;banana-ee&quot; bread. The tweaks I made to this yummy recipe were using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and adding about 1/2 a cup of walnuts. I love when the outside crust of the bread is slightly crunchy and caramelized and the brown sugar helps make that happen. Next time I plan on making the bread without changing anything just for fun.

After I had it in the oven for about half an hour, I noticed that I had forgot to put the eggs in! I was a little worried that it would be crumbly, but it came out of the pans just fine and it was nice and moist. It rose beautifully and smelled really good too. It was a nice golden brown on top. It made my day! Thank you so much for a great recipe.",,
2002065870,2886,2018-03-21,5,"This recipe was so good and easy to follow! I played around a bit, like added a tablespoon more butter, added a teaspoon of baking powder into the mashed bananas to make them fluffier, and mixed some melted dark chocolate on top and made them muffins and it was DELISH! the perfect time for the muffins was 25 mins and i made about 15 muffins! Super light and fluffy!",,

Organic tastes so much better. I used the full serving of Madagascar vanilla and used brown eggs. I also softened the butter to mix better with the sugar. I also used Himalayan salt and 365 all purpose flour. The most perfect banana bread! Next time I’m going to add the cacao nibs from Trader Joe’s.,,

You can forego the nuts for whatever reason you may have but Lord in the heavens above sprinkle the brown sugar it is irresistible!! Next time I'm going to add imitation banana extract instead of vanilla. I think then it will be the most absolutely perfect recipe ever.",,

2002154261,2886,2018-05-21,0,I made it with four bananas and added an extra 1/3 cup flour. The end result was pretty heavy and disappointing for me. The batter didn't rise like I was hoping.,,

2002161450,2886,2018-05-22,5,I didnt read the instructions properly and ended up blending the liquid ingredients too much. So what i did was double the dry ingredients and made 2 bread. which came out amazing. What I also did instead of increases the sugar in the mixture was to mix honey brown sugar and hot water in a separate bowl and glazed once the bread was finished,,

2001740909,2886,2018-06-12,5,"Amazing!!! My family asks for this all the time. I recommend using 3 very large bananas, or 4 smaller/regular sized. 4 large makes it a little mushy :)",,

I've never been much of a baker, I didn't really enjoy baking, and if I had to bake something it was usually out of a box, but this recipe changed all of that. My guy doesn't like sugary things much, but he loves banana bread. I tried a couple of other recipes before discovering this website and this recipe. He loves these, anyone who tries them loves them and I love how easy and versatile they are. And making these and having them turn out so perfect every time gave me the self confidence to try more recipes and now I bake all the time and I shudder at the thought of using a boxed mix. This recipe is fantastic as is, but is also a fantastic base recipe. Whenever I have small amounts of leftover chocolate chips, walnuts, blueberries, coconut, pumpkin, caramel or whatever other random ingredient that sounds good I add it to the batter of individual muffins before baking, which is awesome because I then have a nice mix of different muffins at the end. I have started making them somewhat regularly, and learning how to bake in the process. I am going to try some of the tweaks other people have posted and I also want to experiment with different gluten free flours, I think because this recipe is so simple and consistently makes awesome muffins it is a great one to start learning how to work with different flours and sweeteners, plus learning how to use different egg and dairy substitutes, I have gained a hobby, a love for baking (plus 10 pounds, laugh), that not only makes me happy, but also makes my guy, my friends, and my co workers happy. All thanks to the best banana bread recipe ever.",,
1516209,2886,2018-06-21,5,Love this recipe! I made some changes and it still came out great. Instead of oil I used half cup of applesauce and two tablespoons mayo. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg. I will make it again,,
2002196369,2886,2018-06-24,5,It’s worth using my Kerry gold butter!??. I made this first time hours before going camping. Still warm on the way. It didn’t last long. Came out perfect! I baked double batch in a cake pan (roughly 40-45 mins) added some walnuts. It’s very moist and not too sweet. Will make it again.,,
2002197711,2886,2018-06-25,5,This is a GREAT recipe. 10/10,,
2002198578,2886,2018-06-26,5,Amazing bread! I substituted the butter for coconut oil and didn't add all the sugar in. I also added in chocolate chips and pecans. After pouring it in the pan I sprinkled turbinado sugar and cinnamon on top. A winner in our household!,,

2002017325,2886,2018-06-28,5,Best when cooled but recently it if the oven when the crispy top is irresistable. Otherwise it is moist and flavorful. I added 2 tablespoons of pancake syrup after reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup to add some additional flavor. Very good recipe.,,

2002188458,2886,2018-07-08,5,"DONT DOUBLE THE RECIPE. So I've tried a single and it's amazing, very easy to tweak. It's good if you add chocolate chips or blue berries. I haven't tried it myself, but heard good things about adding strawberries. Anyway. Doubling the recipe causes it to rise faster and it kinda keeps the bread from cooking all the way. Nearly impossible to cook longer or the outside burns. Added note I did freeze the bananas and then that. So it could have been that or too many bananas.",,
2002211927,2886,2018-07-08,5,"wow, this recipe is amazing! my family literally fights over who gets the last piece! it's super delicious, and the banana flavor is amazing. i also have a few tweaks to make this recipe better! i added brown instead of white sugar, and i also didn't use a whole stick of butter. i used about 7/8 of the stick. i would recommend using 4 bananas, they make the bread more moist and the banana flavor is more strong. i also would recommend using the vanilla, even though it says optional. but, i used a whole teaspoon instead of half. last, but not least, are the things to add into the batter! i add a handful of mini chocolate chips and walnuts. i also bought a cinnamon and sugar mix-in for this bread. that mix-in makes the bread a whole lot better! i would definitely recommend this recipe, it's the best one i've tried!",,

2002216720,2886,2018-07-13,5,Really moist. Am surprised it’s not that hard to make. Tried and tasted. Yummy!??,,
2002218062,2886,2018-07-14,5,I loved this easy recipe. The flavor is so good. I used coconut extract instead of vanilla to give it a little Caribbean flavor,,
2002227867,2886,2018-07-23,4,I tried this when I had nothing to do with my bananas that were turning black. Luckily I came across this post and actually tried something that I saw on the internet.... Lol. This turned out great! Loved the addition of a hint of salt. Thanx for breaking it down for us newbies.,,
2002218278,2886,2018-07-14,5,"Absolutely delicious! I made it according to the recipe with one tweak: instead of 1-1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup all-purpose and 1/2 cup King Arthur whole wheat flour. (I mention the brand only because it is the only whole wheat flour I have used). I had four seriously brown bananas, so I exercised the option for the extra. Honestly, I think the fourth banana is a necessity. The 55-minute time frame is right on the money. This is the best banana bread I have made, but I confess that I don't bake very often. Usually my bananas are eaten before they have a chance to brown :).",,

Good basic structure with this recipe, next time I'm going to try making it chocolate by substituting 1/4cup flour with 1/4cup cocoa powder and adding a heavy dose of chocolate chips??. I also made these gluten free and dairy free and the recipe was totally fine using gf flour and vegan butter. My go-to modifications: always 1tbsp of vanilla extract, 4 small ripened bananas, and just a dash of almond extract???? These came out perfectly moist with just the right amount of balance between sweet treat and banana??",,

My only complaint is that it is too much batter for one loaf pan. I should have split it in two and cooked it for about half the time. As it was, the outside was overcooked by the time the inside was done. I cut the edges off my slice and it tasted delicious though. Give it a try!",,

Sometimes I add 4 bananas, if I have them and goodness, the moisture is incredible. It stores well in the fridge or freezer. I will often slice and wrap and store pieces in the freezer and when thawed are just as delicious as the day it was baked.

Never had a loaf last more than a day, every time I make it, my son &amp; husband scarf it down, &amp; they aren't usually real big cake eaters. Use the extra banana. When my bananas are reaching that overripe point, I put them in freezer. When I'm ready to make banana bread, I thaw 4 bananas, which will now be brown. But that's perfect for this recipe.

I did modify slightly (because who doesn't!), putting in 1/3 coconut flour and chocolate chips the first time - delicious.

2002231017,2886,2018-07-27,5,"After trying three different banana bread recipes this week this is definitely the winner by far. I had a lottt of bananas that all had sat for far too long and my girlfriend suggested I try my hand at making banana bread for the first time. I made two other recipes before this one that just didn't have that &quot;mmmf&quot; factor you want from a good banana bread, this one does. It is so moist. I used 3 bananas which gave it just the right amount of banana flavor, and the right amount of sweetness as well. So happy I finally found this recipe! On a side note I did tweak it just a little bit, but nothing crazy and I can tell it would be just as great cooking it as is. I did 3/4 cups white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I only used 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla. I added cinnamon (just followed my intuition on the amount, you know what I'm talking about) and added chopped walnuts as well. I baked it in a greased 8&quot; x 4&quot; loaf pan, was the perfect size pan for it in my opinion. I also covered it with foil for the last 30 minutes which helps prevent the top from getting too dark and brown. Came out perfect and can't wait to make it again for friends and family.",,

2002234671,2886,2018-07-30,5,Just finished making this Banana Bread I doubled the ingredients so I made two loaves. My house smells amazing and 1 of the best easy banana bread recipe ever.,,
2002234996,2886,2018-07-31,5,I’ve made this dozens of times to salvage those bananas we didn’t get to in time. And every time it’s amazing. I add cinnamon and walnuts if I have them bc I like it. I also adjust up or down based on number of banana refugees. It works well in my loaf pan or in cupcake pan with liners. This recipe is adaptable and perfect.,,

2002231594,2886,2018-08-04,0,Never made banana bread with soda or cider vinegar... I'm trying the baking soda now...,,
2002240134,2886,2018-08-05,5,Excellent. 3/4 cup sugar is plenty IMO. I might try 1/2 and 2 sachets of Stevia. When using walnuts....toast them first for better crunch and added flavour. Next time I will add chopped Dates. Another technique is to blend the dates with the eggs. Note dates are sweet so adjust. Tweaking is fun but do it in steps.,,
2001917158,2886,2018-08-06,4,This is the best recipe but.... that being said i cut the sugar by 1/4 cup as i don't have much of a sweet tooth and i added the extra banana and about half way thru baking it started to overflow! the end result was a little mushier than i'd like but for sure the recipe is excellent. next time i will cut back on the banana. oh...and i couldn't resist adding a sprinkle of nutmeg.,,
2002291027,2886,2018-10-03,5,I added 1 tsp of cinnamon. Best banana bread ever!,,
2002240526,2886,2018-08-06,5,Yummy!! Great recipe. I’ve modiflyed it slightly and swaped the 1 cup sugar for 1/2 cup Coconut sugar. I also add Chia Seeds and Chocolate Chips.,,
2001823020,2886,2018-08-07,4,"Ingredients exactly per recipe, using 4 very, very ripe bananas but left out the optional vanilla. Bread is moist and bursting with flavor.

I couldn't tell you why except that another recipe I use has yogurt in it and I'm, perhaps, spoiled with the flavors in that one.",,
1868479,2886,2018-08-10,4,"This is the classic, basic banana bread recipe that almost everyone has, floating around somewhere. And it is good. But make a simple change in technique, and completely transform the character of the bread. Melt the butter, then add sugar as described. It thickens and almost melts, just as it does when you combine melted butter and sugar in the classic brownie recipe (that almost everyone has lurking in their kitchen). The bread becomes much moister and is delectable, just a smidge shy of being sticky. The bread becomes almost luscious. And using melted butter is much easier than creaming it, and frees you from the hassle of using a mixer. Yes, this way you have a basic one bowl, wooden spoon and spatula recipe. It is nice to be able to mix up the whole recipe without employing electricity. Substitute 1/4 cup of the flour for an equal amount of good, strong cocoa, and change the character of the bread once more. The cocoa adds complexity and depth. At this point a lot of people stir in a cup of chocolate chips, but I abstain. Excessive, and too much additional sugar. Of course not everyone enjoys a super moist banana bread that is a little heavier, less cakelike, and more intense than the bread produced by the original recipe, in which sugar and softened butter are creamed. But if you swing toward the dark, deep and intensely fruity end of the spectrum, you will enjoy this recipe made with melted butter!",,

2002272849,2886,2018-09-12,5,I have used this recipe so many times. It’s a major hit and is very forgiving. You can give or take on the quantity of some of the ingredients. I almost always go for 4 instead of 3 bananas because it does make it extra moist. Note that the extra banana can also make it seem like it’s not cooked through so don’t get caught off guard. Sometimes I need to go over the suggested time in the oven until the toothpick comes out a little cleaner (an extra 5-7 minutes). I like adding a quarter cup of chopped pecans or walnuts into the batter before baking. I’ve made these as muffins and mini-loaves before but maybe my time is off - it’s definitely not as moist in the smaller sizes. The full-sized loaf comes out right every time.,,

2002226732,2886,2018-09-25,5,I had bananas in the freezer that had turned. They slid right out of the peel when thawed and were very seeet. The best banana bread I have ever made! I used the 4 bananas and vanilla as per the recipe.,,
2002288996,2886,2018-10-01,1,"The consistency, colour and appearance were perfect. I have never given a recipe a 1 star review. Until today. The flavour - what an awful aftertaste!! A full can of Pepsi couldn’t even wash it away - salty and bitter, really weird. Not sure why either - nothing in the recipe gives that flavour... terrible. Sorry :’( ended up binning the whole lot after one bite...",,
2002289209,2886,2018-10-01,5,"Favorite recipe for work coworkers or just my boyfriend. Everyone eats this so fast, I can sometimes not manage to save myself a piece! I only put in 2/3 cup sugar, and also add in 1/4 cup chocolate chips, and 2 tablespoons of chia seeds. The chia seeds are completely hidden, which is nice. Add them in there for their micronutrients. SUPER moist. I do 4 bananas. Best variation I have ever made.",,
2002293587,2886,2018-10-06,0,"This really is the best banana recipe I have ever had--well, with just a few changes: I didn’t use as much sugar-I only used 5/8 cup sugar, and it was plenty sweet-I generally find most sweet items in the US to be too sweet. I replaced the sugar with 3/8 cup cashew milk because sugar is a liquid in baking. I also added about 2/3 cup chopped hazel nuts, 1/3 cup ground hazel nuts and &frac12; cup toasted dried coconut (small grate). I changed out the soda for baking powder because I thought it would rise better. I made 6 large MUFFINS instead of a loaf, and I think they were the best banana muffins I have ever had. Let cool a full 5 minutes before taking out of the muffin pan and they are beautiful!",,
2002208175,2886,2018-10-07,5,This is the best bannana bread I have ever made. Love it. The kids also like it when we make muffins out of it. 23 minutes and they come out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe,,

I will be making a few loafs for the upcoming holidays. Also Don’t forget.... after the loaf of bread is room temperature, wrap It in foil and plastic wrap and freeze it. When ready to use, remove the foil and plastic wrap and cut the bread in slices (while still frozen) This keeps the bread from crumbling!",,

2002334977,2886,2018-11-17,5,I’ve made this banana bread many times and it is absolutely delicious. The only change I make is to add some coconut to it.

Every one had seconds. Thanx",,

842751,2891,2008-07-03,5,"I wanted to take this to our family fourth of July picnic. So, I made it before to test my husband and son. I used both yellow squash and zucchini. I cut down on the dried red pepper to 1/4 tsp. as my family are all wimps when it comes to the heat. I also used half red pepper and half green pepper cut up.  I did leave out the almonds,tarragon, oregano and basil. I used the dill, though. And, instead of the italian dressing, I made up a pkg. of Uncle Dan's Buttermilk Ranch and used that.  I used some of the tri colored pasta twists and some of the plain ones. This is a very good recipe to use as a base for a pasta salad. My husband and son liked it and I am always looking for different pasta salad recipes to try. Thanks so much for posting this one! The ingredients are colorful and the flavors all blend well together!",,
201369,2891,2009-06-30,5,"This makes a beautiful and very eye appealing salad to take to picnics.  It makes a very large amount, but the leftovers are delicious (refrigerated) and you can eat for several days.  Just to cut down on a few calories, I use a lowfat or fat free Zesty Italian Salad dressing and there is no difference in the great flavor.  Be sure to let the salad marinate in the dressing for a minimum of two hours!  I have been making this salad for years.  It's always a winner wherever I take it!!!",,

I''m sure it''s going to taste fabulous so I will give it the highest rating! Mahalo for the great recipe and looking forward to more... Aloha, Ijeva
-----I finally baked the cake and changed it to chocolate instead of yellow cake mix.  It is absolutely delicious.  I would however, not put 2 cups of sugar because it is awfully sweet but might reduce the quantity or even substitute with some kahlua and milk instead.

Other than that, my son devoured the rest of the cake.  Superb!",,

For the ground red pepper we used cayenne (go very light lest it be too hot).  I will admit that we bumped the amount of garlic up a bit to about 3 cloves chopped.,,
10314,2903,2001-09-13,5,This recipe was REALLY quick and easy.  It tasted wonderful.  The peppers gave it an almost sweet flavor.  Very different from conventional fish recipes.  I will be making this again very soon.,,
10934,2903,2002-01-27,5,Very Good!! We really liked the levels of flavor from the sweet peppers and the mexican tomatoes around the light flaky fish. I served it over rice and it was a great meal with a salad. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut the yellow peppers in smaller pieces. The big rings were sloppy when eating.,,
34025,2903,2004-04-05,5,This was a really good dish and  was fast and easy to put together. It also has a really nice blend of flavors...will definitely make this again.,,

1166330,2903,2009-05-12,5,Was awesome I made this for my father in law and he just loved it so did my husband the only thing I changed was instead of onions (husband does not like) I added sliced fresh jalapenos came out nice and just right spicy.,,

178738,2913,2007-11-28,5,"These were absolutely incredible! I had just been wanting a way to use up zucchini, but these are a new favorite. I used regular cheese and mayo (not low-fat), and I sauted the zucchini (plus the chopped mushroom stems) in a little butter. Plus, I rubbed a little olive oil around each mushroom cap. After I stuffed the mushrooms, I topped them with a bit of provolone, then broiled them until the cheese melted. Yum!",,

460978,2919,2007-03-07,4,"My first chocolate cake and it was wonderful! Almost like the ones they sell at local bakeries on the islands! The color wasn't as dark as I wanted it but the texture was fantastic--very soft and fluffy! The magic, however, is in the frosting! If you make this cake, you simply MUST make the frosting to go with it! For someone like me who normally scoops frosting OFF cakes, I was practically licking my plate! To make it though, was a bit daunting. On the first attempt, my frosting came out too lumpy. On the 2nd try, I revised it by adding the powdered cocoa and 1/2 c. water mixture into the buttery liquid first (after step 16). Then with the remaining cornstarch, I scooped about 2-3 spoonfuls into a small seperate bowl and mixed it with the some of the simmering sauce from the stove. Stirred it til silky smooth and poured it back into the simmering pot to thicken it, mixing it once again. Repeat this several times, while keeping the bubbling mix on low heat and contantly stirring. I did have to add a bit of water from time to time to keep it from thickening too much, but I recommend you do so by instinct. The frosting should be almost like a pudding texture; maybe a little thinner. When done, you'll have to work quickly to frost the cake but your knife will just glide on the cake and the end result is just fabulous! I only frosted the top of my cake but baked it in a 9X13 inch pan. Will make this again and again for sure! Mahalo, Laniakea! **Recommended for all those who want a piece of aloha(love)!**",,
2214444,2919,2012-03-18,0,"This is the first time I've incorporated anything into beaten egg whites so this was new territory for me.  I thought the cake would be the difficult part, but it turned out lovely.  The tricky part as lemonlylime pointed out is the frosting.  I was in a hurry and tried to make it quickly and ended up with starch lumps.  I didn't spend enough time mixing the cocoa, cornstarch and water together and kind of sloshed it in the bubbling pot while trying to stir with the other hand.  In a burst of inspiration I thought i could smooth out the lumps in my blender. Those of you who know better are probably falling off your chairs, but I was in a rush and desperate.  It didn't work, so don't try it.  After a few spins and sitting out for a spell it looked liked something I imagine you might find in a macbeth cauldron- so it ended up in the trash.  I tried a second time and thoroughly mixed the cocoa, starch and water together and was a bit more coordinated when combining it with the bubbling solution in the pot.  It turned out better, but the were a few lumps.  You have to be careful about the how fast you let it come to a boil, I think.  I fathom it's like making gravy, but I have never made gravy so this is only a guess. End result: Positive.  I received the Hawaiian seal of approval from hubby... Trickier to execute than anticipated.  Next time I will try lemonlylime's suggestions.",,
2695562,2919,2013-02-16,0,"Please be advised. No cream and cornstarch doesn't make the Dobash frosting from the good old days. look up Ganache frosting instead it's closer to the rich frosting from back in the day.Lihia Baker's and HECO's recipes are the same disappointing result. Local girls are like Southern women in that a large part of our identities and self worth relate to our cooking skills. I was bragging about our local Dobash frosting and was embarrassed by this, HECO's and Liliha Bakery's recipes all falling short. Especially if it is the favorite of your new boyfriend or husband's father. Nothing without cream can be better than something with cream.",,

In my version I have added 1/4 of honey and did a coconut oil wash (melt the coconut oil before apply to the bread) instead of the egg wash.

I halved the recipe and used 1 granny smith apple and 2 apples of unknown brand (they looked a bit like Gala apples) that were soft, but hadn't gone bad yet.  I tossed the apple slices with a couple tsp's of lemon juice.  I used Smart Balance Spread with Flaxseed oil for the unsalted butter and for buttering the 8 inch square pan I used.

This recipe is from Epe in Gelderland in Holland.
To 2 litres of boiling beef stock (16 cups)add 500g (1lb) of minced lamb fry (liver) and 500g (1lb) minced beef. 
When boiling, add salt 'til it's too salty (approx 15 teaspoons).  In addition, add AllSpice (Pimento) 'til it's too spicy (approx 5 teaspoons).
Boil rapidly until meats are cooked.
Take the pot off heat, then add (quickly) approx. 2lb (1kilo) white flour stirring continuously until it's a 'lump' which you can't stir anymore (you may need help with this as the arms go into heavy duty mode).  Try to ensure that the flour is evently stirred with no lumps.
Spoon into (floured)containers and leave to chill.
Turn out from container once chilled and cut into 1cm slices, then fry in extremely hot pan with preferred oil, butter or fat until dark brown and crispy.  (Good idea to fry outside as can leave 'blue' smoke throughout house)

I only used 1/2 of the suggested amount of raspberry sherbert.  I also added frozen raspberries, which I let thaw a little.  For 45 women, we went through about 4 7-quart punch bowls of the punch.  I will diffinitely use this recipe again.  As a matter of fact, I am giving a Bridal Shower in May, so I will use it again.  It is delicious and easy.  Try it and ENJOY!",,

I highly recommend this punch, not only for its ease and simplicity, but for its nice presentation and delicious taste! I recommend making sure the ginger ale and pineapple juice are both cold so the sherbet doesn't melt too quickly. Thanks so much!! Will make this again! Oh yeah, used diet ginger ale as I really don't drink regular sodas...turned out great with this substitution!",,
74868,2941,2007-12-19,5,"I have now made this punch 3 times in one month because it has been so popular. Even my husband loves it and made it at a work party where it was a hit! The first time I used Raspberry flavored ginger ale.  It was for a baby shower and it gave it a nicer pink color, however, I didn't think the flavor was as good as the other times.   I also have been making ice things to keep the punch cold out of pineapple juice concentrate (made with half the water) with frozen strawberries.  This allows me to make about 3 batches of punch using only one big can of pineapple juice.  I make the first batch at full strength, and the rest with less pineapple juice because my ice things add flavor to the bowl!!! (my ice cream came in quarts, so I just top off the bowl with a half batch every so often)  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!",,

I also  used smoked paprika and since I didn't have any celery, I used a touch of celery salt.

It was very tasty and really does cook quickly. Mine was about a 1/2 pound steak and cooked over medium to medium high (about the 5:00 position on the knob) in only about 6 minutes and it was perfectly tender.

The texture of it was denser and I detected no fishy flavor.  I would have loved to cooked with capers, but I had none.  So I took my 1 inch marlin steaks and cut them in half.  I heated olive oil hot.  I added salt and pepper to the steaks that I dried with paper towels, then coated the steaks with breadcrumbs.  After adding to the pan, I topped with lemon juice and fresh slices of oranges.  I cooked each side just a couple of minutes turning only once.  The end result was FABULOUS!",,

Mmmmm! Some of the pecans were left in larger pieces and they made a candied topping. Served with a little scoop of low fat ""double churned"" ice cream.

133174,2987,2012-11-14,5,This is really good chili.  Very nicely seasoned and so comforting for the cooler days ahead.  I cooked the black beans using Recipe #248544 and decided that 1 pound of cooked dried beans was way to much.  A lean pork sirloin roast was used for the meat.  After browning the onions and meat 2 cups of cooked black beans along with the remaining ingredients were placed in a slow cooker.  After cooking all day on low the meat was very tender.  The chili is well seasoned and a winner for me.  Thanks much for posting.,,
565041,2987,2015-01-27,5,"Flavor is incredible!  I used pork butt steak that had been in the freezer too long, it was fatty and stringy but turned out melt in your mouth tender. I used 1 can each black and pinto beans and 1 can chicken broth which made my chili very thick, we ate it over rice.  I used miscellaneous chopped peppers including a couple of jalape&ntilde;os and omitted the chili powder. It was nice and spicy.  May be even better the second day.",,
672534,2987,2017-02-24,5,"This is very similar to a recipe I have called &quot;Cuban Beans.&quot; I used previously cooked pork, so didn't get the brown fond from browning the pork, but it was still very good. I think I would skip the vinegar. My Cuban Beans recipe also calls for it, and one time that I made it I forgot to put in the vinegar, and I liked it better. You be the judge. I would have liked this recipe better if there was more of the delicious broth. I think I would cut back on the beans to get there (maybe by half?) I think it would be good if the broth were thickened a bit as well. I'm not sure what thickener would be good. You wouldn't want to mash the beans or add anything that would make the broth creamy looking, because part of the appeal of this dish is the clear and bright colors of the peppers and tomato broth. I used 2 green peppers and 1 red, it was a really pretty dish.",,

4470,3003,2004-03-31,4, I think there are many variations on Blinde Vinken and I took a couple of liberties with this recipe- Veal is very expensive so instead of the veal cutlet on the out side I used paper thin slices of prosciutto to cover the ground veal .  I added fresh mushrooms to the pan. Otherwise I followed the recipe and they turned out beautifully. A nice change Thanks Carol,,

I had some leftover fresh salmon, so flaked & used that.  I didn't have any parsley (that would've been a nice touch - next time I'll make sure to have some on hand).  I decided to go with the White Worchester Sauce for no particular reason.   Halving the sauce recipe made plenty & I did double the lemon juice.

Thank you Sean!!",,

I left out the worcestershire sauce and parsley, simply because we don't care for them. I added some onion. I also used multi wheat crackers, because I was out of bread. I will make this again and again. A good way to get your omega 3. I will also double the sauce next time. Very easy to make, I had everything on hand.",,

Maybe a bit hot, but I didn't notice.   It turned out fantastically.  I would have liked maybe a little less moisture in the final product, but quite tasty.  Many people make mention of what they would do or had to succumb to doing..... me being one of those people.   I always have lemons at my disposal, for cooking, at this time, only limes....oh well.  My darling hubby says he would not have it any other way.  Not sure whether he means it, or just loves me for cooking for him.

I didn't have any parsley so I had to skip it.It was easy to put together.  It started browning by 30 min so you may want to watch the time.  The sauce is really yummy!  I put about 2x the amount of lemon juice... we like things really lemmony.  I just reduced the amount of milk by a couple of tablespoons and it came out creamy and perfect.  It is quite spicy so I may cut the amount of cyanne in half.  This time I added 1 tsp of sugar to help mild it.  My husband just came it and tried a bite...

So, it was the night before and I wanted to make a lunch item but couldn't run to the store for anything. This recipe was great. I love that I could make several patties without frying! The patties pretty much tasted like the ones I make and fry, but the sauce was awesome! I added more lemon juice as I love lemon. I kind of wish I'd added a little less cayenne, however...it was super tasty but a little spicy for my personal taste. Husband loved it and didn't think it was spicy at all. I put the sauce in a bowl and everyone spooned it to use as dip for the patties. Much loved!",,
102833,3009,2009-05-19,4,Baked rather than fried -- what a great idea!  I added a little chopped celery along with the onion since I'm used to patties that way.   For the sauce I used chicken broth instead of milk in the white sauce.  Very Tasty!!,,

The directions are clear, well-written and easy to follow, and that is why I assigned this two stars rather than just one. I followed them exactly. The mixture was hard to press into the pan, as it starts to set up almost immediately. But I got it levelled into the 13x9 pan, melted the chocolate and spread it over top, then let it sit at room temperature rather than in the fridge, because I didn't want it to go too hard. I needn't have bothered! This is as hard as a rock! With difficulty, I managed to crack a piece out with my chef's knife; nothing else would cut this.

I made a few personal tweaks with ingredients (I like to use PB & Co cinnamon raisin swirl peanut butter and add about 1 c. raisins to the bars), but I think people who are having trouble with the bars getting hard are maybe cooking the syrup and sugar for too long/bringing it to too high of a temperature?  I stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved and it just starts to bubble when I stop stirring for a few seconds, turn the heat off, add the peanut butter and stir until it's mostly melted, then take the pan off the hot burner to stir in the cereal and any other mix-ins I'm using.

I quickly mixed it into the cornflour mixture, then carried on with the recipe.  You could see little curdled bits in the final product, but you couldn't taste them.",,

This is a guilt-free soup that is very satisfying.  Thanks for sharing.",,

Used broccoli instead of pea pods.  Should have added more red pepper.  Sauce was a little too salty for me; didn't quite double that (there wasn't much at the bottom when I stored the leftovers).

You can make this as spicy as you dare, by altering the amount of cayenne.  The spicier the better for me, so I added a bit of Tabasco to the mix for good measure.  Also threw in a good-sized pinch of basil. 
Although the recipe calls for crock-pot cooking, I was pressed for time and prepared this on the stove-top.  Next time I will try the crock pot, just so this wonderful smell will be present in the kitchen throughout the day.",,

Also used 4 oz shredded cheddar. The crusts from the bread made about 2 cups. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. It was a good, quick, meal. Not the greatest for flavor.

It's relatively easy if you divide the dough and place a bit (1/6th to 1/8th of the dough) on one half of a long sheet of plastic wrap.  Fold the other half of the plastic over the top of the dough and roll out thinly.  Place the resulting ""sandwich"" of dough inside plastic wrap on a cookie sheet and put in freezer until firm.  By the time you finish rolling out the rest of the dough between pieces of plastic wrap, the first one into the freezer will be cold enough to cut cookies out.  Take scraps and reroll inside same pieces of plastic wrap, replace in freezer and continue until all the dough has been used.  They're so delicate and crisp when done this way.  I've never tried to frost them; they may be too fragile for that.",,

I've made them from premade dough, but never homemade and this recipe was so good, just the right amount of everything.  However, I did change a couple things - no almond extract so doubled the vanilla.  I replaced whole egg with Eggbeaters and used Smart Balance with Flaxseed Oil for the margarine.  I didn't ice them, I stuck red hot cinnamon candies in the cookies before baking.  They took about 9 mins.  I rolled them out thin and followed the tip from another reviewer about using plastic wrap and the freezer method.  Worked great, they came out crispy and sweet.

(FYI, I followed Babs' recommendation to bake it for 45 minutes at 300 degrees, and Pat's recommendation to use half golden syrup and half brown sugar, which might have made a difference.) I think the ratio of oats to syrup is way off, because mine turned out more like a gooey candy with some oats in it. If I could change the texture of this recipe and keep the flavor, I think it would be a winner; so, I might try it again with 12 or even 16 oz oats, and see if that helps turn it into a syrupy oat bar rather than a soft oat-studded toffee.",,

I wound up dumping it all into the original container and trying again with something that was tall and lean, so the straws were snug in the container. So if your container is too big, it runs right back out.. There was definitely jello on the insides of that container, but it also stayed in the straws..  I thought had plenty of raspberry jello, but only had 1 container, so I used a blue berry to go with.. By the time I got the green food coloring mixed in, my worms were grey.. Which was still ok.. They were a big hit! Thanks!",,

I used a tall, round straw holder to set the straws in to fill with the Jello mixture, PERFECT!

First I tried squeezing the open end of the straw with the pliers but it was too slippery. Then I tried grabbing the straw with one nose of the pliers inside the straw and the other nose outside. That did the trick. With my new solid grip I was able to squeeze the worms out quickly and easily...they practically slid out! It should only take you a few seconds for each straw. The worms really complemented my Qwiggle Halloween Jello molds (I have the hand, brain and eyeballs). Check out Qwiggle Jello molds online, they look so real it's scary. I love my gruesome but tasty treats for Halloween!",,
592245,3092,2008-11-01,5,My daughter and I had great time making these.  They came out a bit darker because in australia our packaging is different and it was hard to get correct conversions.  The kids loved them.,,
191257,3092,2008-11-12,5,"ooooh wee! these were a hit at my son's halloween party. I used a box of green lime and orange, did everything else the same and they were a GREAT green color. I pushed in about 20 more straws and 2 days later pushed all those suckers out with my fingers - that was hard work! LOL About 20 straws after I started I remember I was to rinse them and that made the job much less messy. :-) 
They will be at the party next year too! Thanks!",,
717898,3092,2009-05-03,3,What a cool idea!  I love it.  Until it came time to get the worms out of the straws.  Way too time consuming.  I ran out of time and gave up. They look just like real worms though.  May try again next year and start early just because it is so gross - I mean cool!  :),,

These really looked real.  We did have a bit of trouble with the first few, but then we found that holding the end of the straw with needle-nosed pliers helped a lot.  Also, be sure to run the worms under hot water long enough.  We were afraid that they would melt, but found that if you do it correctly, they will remove with ease and have a glossy appearance to them.
Thanks for a great gross-out recipe.",,

I didn't have whipping cream so I substituted cool whip with a little powdered sugar to thicken the cool whip. They still turned out! I also put a little crushed up graham cracker to look like dirt.

I did not have the jello called for, but I don't think it matters. I used what I had. They were both red jellos and both were sugar free. I added blue food coloring to the jello mix to make it more purple, then I added enough green to the whipping cream to balance the color. I tried the rolling pin method, but the worms were too uniform when they came out. I also found it a bit awkward. The finger method worked best for me, until I remembered that I had a small surgical clamp. I clamped it onto the end, which left both fingers free to squeeze out the worm and direct it into the bowl. I am excited to see my goblins tomorrow night! Thanks again for this wonderful share!",,

Though I have to admit taking a few liberties - I used chicken breast instead of turkey, because chicken is easier for me to find. I also used hot Thai chilies instead of jalapenos, for the same reason. And then, I had pre-cooked black beans in the freezer, so I sort of took the ingredients and amounts for this recipe, but rearranged the cooking. Nonetheless, it is delicious, though next time, I'll think before using so many chilies. Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.

I'm sure they would be delicious made like that. I took the chicken pieces out of the liquid, reduced it a little, and then added them back, so they had a sauce.

1800363658,3110,2013-11-30,4,This is a great recipie but it lies.  Prep time is more like 5 min/foot if you have to skin them.&lt;br/&gt;The trick to doing this is to heat a pot of water to boiling.  Take one frozen foot and stick it in the water for about 4 min.  Take it out and cut along the ankle and toes to get the skin started and peel.  Cut off the nails at the first joint above them.  You can do this in either order but I think taking the mails off first works best.  As you are skinning one foot boil the other.  This comes out to about the right timing to go through you feet.,,

I used to use 2 pks Near east Rice Pilaf original , toasted in a dutch oven (after browning the chicken bites) and then just pour the large can of tomatoes in with a cup of water. I used to add parsley and paprika, but never tried sherry, onions or garlic. I still use my rice technique, but the incorporation of the additional ingredients put it over the top.",,
2001624085,3115,2017-07-12,5,This is a fabulous recipe. I had the same recipe from Cafe Budapest chef's cookbook many years ago and I had forgotten the fact that it had sherry in it. So glad to see the recipe again. Simple and wonderful.,,

1135147,3119,2009-01-18,5,We were looking for a recipe for Christmas Eve that included a blend of our favorite seafood.  We found this and tried it out.  it was sooooo good and easy!!  It was so good we even enjoyed it without the sauce.  It is so good it would go well with any sauce.  We are looking forward to making it again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!,,
29356,3121,2002-11-06,5,I have made this before and this recipe is absolutely incredible.  I would recommend using the marscapone cheese if you can find it for the taste and texture.  Remember not to soak the sponge cake too long in the liquid or you have a mess.  Just a quick in and out dip.   ,,
74736,3121,2003-03-09,5,"i just wanted to add my comments, you shouldnt post something on here if you havent tried the recipe regardless of how you think it *sounds* it brings down the rating of other peoples recipes that might actually be quite good and scare others away from trying it. so try before you give a rating!",,

368897,3121,2007-11-30,4,"I adore Olive Garden's Tiramisu, and was thrilled when I found this recipe!  I would strongly advise people making this to use mascarpone and not cream cheese.  I've had tiramisu made with cream cheese and it's way too heavy and the taste of cream cheese is much stronger.  I made this according to the recipe with one exception.  I only mixed in about an ounce and a half of brandy.  Three ounces seemed way too much to me.  I didn't want it to completely overpower the coffee, and even with just an ounce and a half, it was very strong.  Olive Garden must mix something else in with the mascarpone cheese, because it's very light.  This is more of a cannoli cream texture, but the taste was good.  Not quite like Olive Garden, but still good.  Next time I might try rum instead of brandy and see if it is a little less strong.  Overall this is a nice recipe and it's simple to put together.",,
693592,3121,2007-12-18,1,"This is NOT the Olive Garden recipe.  Their tiramisu has NO alcohol in it. Which is why I love it.  Also, there is no cream cheese in it.",,
500586,3121,2010-12-23,1,"If you have ever eaten the tiramisu at the Olive Garden, you will know that they only use ladyfingers and not sponge cake. You should rename your recipe and take the name of ""Olive Garden"" out of it because this is nothing like the original; it's very misleading.",,
10701,3122,2004-03-27,4,Great one Helen. I cut everything in half. Used rum insead of brandy and did half mascarpone and half cream. The only thing i had trouble with was the length of time to refrigerate as I have never made Tiramisu before. The family loved It. Jackie.,,

Rather than use veal in this recipe I suggest using boneless pork, which is what is used by the German restaurants I've eaten at here in the US use.  It's also my meat of choice when I make schnitzel.  Pork is light in color like veal, which also gives it an authentic look.",,
394085,3143,2008-06-25,4,"Delicious!  I did use veal and it was tender--but given the cost of veal, and since the sauce and stuffing are predominant flavors, I think I will use pork in the future.  Since I could find no prepared ""spice plum sauce,"" I made Recipe #136437 to use.  Tart, sweet and it worked nicely.
I certainly will make this again.",,

110506,3149,2004-05-02,4,This was very good. I used a steak here in the Netherlands which is called kogel beefsteak. It is a very lean tough piece of meat and this marinade vastly improved the flavor and the tenderness. I cooked the steaks on the charcoal grill and they were very tasty. ,,

338394,3149,2006-07-30,5,"I loved it!  You have to adjust the ingredients a bit though.  I recommend reducing the olive oil by half, doubling the balsamic vinegar and leaving it ""wet"" (don't pat dry) when you put it on the grill.  Also, don't discard the garlic as it adds a great aroma and taste to the meat while it cooks.  This marinade is good for one pound of steak only, you will need to make more for larger portions of meat.  Marinade for a minimum of one hour for each inch of thickness.  I know the receipe says that the balsamic vinegar doesn't have to be expensive but make sure it's strong or you will be left with a steak that has a great aroma with little flavor.  Again, I love it and highly recommend it to those individuals who like their steaks with a little flair.   ",,

There wasn't a lot of meat left on the bones, so I decided to also throw in some of the leftover turkey. In addition, I added some of the stuffing and leftover veggies and substituted medium egg noodles for fine. After I started the soup, I decided that warm, homemade bread from my bread machine would be the perfect accompaniment. Since that would take 3+ hours, I just had the soup simmer longer while I made the bread. Other than having to add more water, it didn't matter - the soup came out wonderful.

I also left out the noodles. 
By freezing it plain, I can cook some noodles as the soup thaws, voils, turkey noodle soup. If I add cooked rice instead of noodles, I have turkey rice soup. I can always use the soup as the liquid ingredients for any number of casseroles.

I also added a little bit of thyme and used mixed veggies (carrots, corn, peas, beans and lima beans) as I have a lot of them in the freezer and lastly added some mushroms. We all enjoyed it and now we are looking foward for the next holiday to have turkey and I'll surely made this again.",,
808027,3157,2009-11-25,5,"Excellent!  I used Rescued Turkey Broth (recipe on zaar) inst  ead of the water and bouillon cubes.  Left out the green beans and peas due to family's preferences and added a little white wine and some thyme.  This made an outstanding soup and will be my new Thanksgiving leftover soup from now on.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!!!  (Gobble, gobble)",,

760852,3157,2009-11-30,5,"WOW, so easy and an incredibly good, hearty soup!  Based on other reviewers comments and our own preferences, I made a few adjustments, but the overall recipe is a WINNER that I will continue to use, with chicken as well!  My modifications were: Instead of water, used low-sodium, low-fat chicken broth; instead of bouillon cubes, I used Â½ packet Lipton onion soup mix; I used 2 bay leaves instead of 1; instead of green beans, I used a jar mushroom pieces; can of corn; 3 gloves crushed garlic; and 1 tsp rosemary.  Instead of flour/water roux, I poured in leftover turkey gravy, which was perfect.  And finally, also cook my noodles separately and spoon them into individual soup bowls so they don't get overly done or leave the soup starchy.  Thanks, Frank!!!",,
406903,3157,2009-12-07,4,"Fantastic recipe!  The only thing I would change is to add more of the turkey to the soup.  We always end up with plenty of left-overs, and this was a great way to use them and have a hearty soup.",,

I omit the peas and beans and add more carrots, but it is so yummy and some real ""comfort food.""

780604,3157,2012-01-17,5,"This soup was fabulous!  I omitted the flour/butter as I was afraid it would thicken it too much for my taste.  I loved it!  My 15 year old son, who usually grunts and groans when I make something new, loved it as well.  Thank you for the recipe Frank!",,
2123645,3157,2013-07-31,4,"Very easy and tasty. I actually made my own favorite turkey broth (just using salt, no bouillion), then added the veggies, leftover turkey and gluten-free noodles. I wasn&#039;t sure if I would like the butter-flour roux, but it added just the right amount of thickness and butter flavor.",,
451319,3157,2013-11-05,5,"I&#039;m not a soup maker normally, but decided to make this after grilling a turkey this past weekend.  I used a combination of mesquite and cherry to add some smoke to the turkey.  I think this is one of the best soups I&#039;ve ever had in my life!  It would be great with &quot;regular&quot; leftover turkey, but the subtle smokiness just brings it to a whole new level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will definitely make again and again.",,

2001279325,3157,2016-12-03,5,I make this recipe a few times a year. My family and I love it so much. I sometimes double the recipe so I can bring some to my loved ones. I don't deviate from Frank's recipe at all. It's out of this world delicious.,,
2001504477,3157,2017-04-24,5,Made this last night for dinner and it was a big hit. I added some fresh sage and thyme to mine as well as some carrots. Turned out great thanks for my new favorite turkey soup.,,

The second time I made it while a gluten intolerant family was eating with us. I added rice instead of noodles and left the butter/flour mixture out. They gave it three stars.,,
25467,3158,2002-02-07,5,"Just tried this recipe and my whole family liked it!  Due to not planning ahead, I had to improvise a little...substituted chopped roasted red peppers for the pimentos, fresh mushrooms for the canned and used a large can of white meat chicken.  To lighten it up a bit, I doubled the peas and used reduced fat soup.  I served it over no-yolk egg noodles.  We had steamed broccoli for a side.

419006,3158,2009-11-24,5,Made this a couple of nights ago and I can't say enough about how good it was.  It was a hit with everyone and it was even better warmed up the next day.  Super easy to make...we served it over rice.  The only change I made was to add more milk because it was a little thick.  I just poured and stirred til I got it to the right consistency.

I just an organic black cherry tea that had steeped overnight and was nice and dark.  For the fruits, I used raisins, prunes and apricots (I snipped the prunes/apricots into smaller bits to be approx the same size as the raisins).  After my tea had steeped, some of the liquid (about a Tbs) had evaporated so I topped it off with a little cognac.  Yum.  Very dense and fruity bread.  I acutally found it a tad dry.  I think that it might benefit from the addition of some oil or even another egg.  Or even slightly less flour, as I didn't feel this had the problem with being gummy that very low/no fat baked goods often have.  Very tasty with tons of great flavor- the tea makes it taste very unique. Thanks!",,

25784,3161,2002-12-28,4,"This was an easy recipe to prepare.  The result was a very sticky, gooey, sweet treat.  By the way, 1 can of condensed milk equals 1 cup. I made a second time , heating the condensed milk in the microwave to help it spread more evenly and I used shredded, sweetened coconut instead of the almond joys.  I did everything else the same, except bake in a 15 x 10 pan for 25 minutes.  I drizzled some milk chocolate over the top.  I think that the original recipe has the better taste, because you just can't duplicate the Almond Joy's, but heating the milk definitly helped the second batch, as did the larger pan.  Thanks for the unusal take on plain old brownies.",,

61162,3161,2003-03-07,5,Incredible!  I made these in the beginning of the week and my husband is already bugging me for another batch!!!  The only alteration I made was to add skor bit and a bit of cocunut to half of it(didn't have enough almond joy).  Great flavor and they stay moist for days(not that they lasted very long)  Thanks so much!,,
18344,3161,2003-03-10,5,wonderful! best brownies ever. i forgot to buy the condensed milk while at the grocery store but decided to make them anyways. delicious! used 3 regular size almond joy bars. my roomate loved these as did my neighbor bob. thanks!,,

I made these as part of a brownie platter and honestly they were not my favorite but they were quite good. They were so easy to make and I am sure that had I made them alone they would have not had to struggle to get my favor. I think I will try making them again using DC brownie mix and see what happens. Bt the way, these also freeze quite well.",,

I asked a couple of people who bought the brownies what they would rate them (between 1 and 5) and they both said ""4"".  I added the extra star for ease of preparation.  I couldn't find 14 ounce packages of Almond Joy Bars, so I just used the 11.9 ounce packages.  I also didn't measure the condensed milk--I just used 1 14 ounce can for each batch.

36739,3164,2002-08-28,5,"What an unexpectedly great combination of ingredients!  We all loved this recipe, although we were a bit doubtful in the beginning.  I made the following changes:  I used about 1 pound of skinless boneless chicken breast, and reduced the cooking time by about 20 min.  The onions were a bit crunchy - I think the onion slices could be cooked a little, maybe in broth, before adding them to the pan.  The recipe did not specify, so we peeled the figs and split them in half before putting the pan in the oven.  
I am really happy that this recipe was brought to my attention through the newsletter, as I would probably never have come across it.  Wonderfully spicy and really good with rice (I used basmati, but any rice would do).
Try it, you won't be sorry.  (However, it does not seem to be Greek, despite the Greek noam.)",,
35140,3164,2002-11-04,5,"I love this recipe - it smells wonderful cooking and it's so unique.  I didn't like the color of the skin or texture of the onions when I initially finished baking it, so I just removed the foil, cranked my heat up to 475 and let it crisp, but then my oven is slow, so often I have to make adjustments.  I'll definitely make this again.",,

27678,3166,2005-02-04,5,"This was fab. It would be a great dinner party dish for an informal night with friends because it has a great presentation and if you get the ingredients laid out beforehand it comes together in a flash. I made a few changes to reflect what I had on hand, but I don't think they affected the dish significantly. I marinated the chicken in a bit of lemon juice, salt and pepper for about 20 minutes. I also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and lightly sauteed spring onions instead of parsley on top. For the breadcrumbs, I made my own using fresh bread, whizzed in a food processor and toasted in the oven. I think the total dish as written here would make quite a lot, maybe enough for 5-8 people depending if you serve with a salad and bread or not. I only had 1 chicken breast (admittedly it was a big one -- 250g) and used 5oz pasta and that was plenty for 2, with pasta left over.",,
174121,3166,2005-02-10,5,This was really good.  Probably would have been even better if I had remembered to pound the chicken first as the recipe said.  Great as leftovers also.,,

I used roast vegetable pasta sauce and fresh buffalo mozzarella rather than the  kind you can shred, so I just cut it into small chunks and added it while the chicken was still in the pan so that it would melt a little. It was delicious.",,

450004,3166,2008-07-04,4,"I loved this recipe, as did my hubby!  As mentioned by someone else, I added more sauce than you said. Great recipe though, and one I'll be making often! :)",,
793153,3166,2008-07-28,5,We loved it!!!!  My husband loved it crispy before the sauce was added and my daughter loved it with the sauce.  I loved it both ways!  It was very easy and delicious.  This will definitely be added to the monthly we-are-hungry-need delicious-food fast menu!  Thanks!,,

742173,3166,2008-10-28,0,"Very easy to make, although I didn't have bread crumbs so I ground up some garlic-onion crackers instead.  The chicken was fantastic!  This will be a regular on my menu.",,

1112579,3166,2009-01-04,5,quick and tasty! I altered it a bit. I put Parmesan cheese in the bread crumbs. I also just put a bit of sauce over the top of the chicken then mozzarella cheese. I popped it under the broiler for a minute or two to get it nice and melted.,,
898290,3166,2009-01-06,5,Absolutely amazing...my husband and daughter both said it was one of the best things ive made!!! I have to agree... it was to die for.,,

1166077,3166,2009-02-11,5,"I made this for my husband and I and we loved it! When I made it I fried off some onion and sliced musrooms first and added them to the pasta sauce. I am in the UK and used Dolmio and it worked perfectly. Also, we were unable to get italian style breadcrumbs, so I just used Paxo ones, which worked well. I served it with spaggetti. An absolutely delicious meal, that I will definitely be making again really soon.",,
37449,3166,2009-04-15,5,"My husband just loved this dish!  I used whole wheat angel hair pasta. I had plain homemade breadcrumbs, so just added Italian seasoning. Thanks Marg, it was a hit!",,
135278,3166,2009-06-09,5,Oh my! This was so good I think it's now a favorite with the family . Pretty easy too. Thanks for a great recipe!,,
1048952,3166,2009-07-08,5,This was so yummy with sauteed garlic and oil linguine and a side salad.  The best part is it's quick to the table when everyone is hungry and you need something quick.  This sure fit the bill!,,
579298,3166,2009-09-10,3,"This was okay, bonus for being super simple though!",,
1405987,3166,2009-10-06,4,I thought the recipe was a little bland; but significant other loved it. 5 stars for easiness. Will definitely make again with a few more spices.,,
1436308,3166,2009-11-04,5,I recently made it for the first time and everybody loved it!  It will be made again!  Very easy to make!  I had to use a little more butter then described.  I also added the parmesan cheese while cooking the chicken.,,
424762,3166,2009-12-26,5,"We loved it!!! Fast ,easy and delicious. I used chicken cutlets..already thin-cut-for you..the egg dip and bread crumb coating keeps the cutlets crisp..I added more Italian seasoning to the crumbs and used Paul Newman Marinara  and Ragu Old World Traditional sauce as I like the combination when I don't make my own sauce.  I do use fresh grated Parmigiano  Reggiano cheese and had to have some mozarella which i sprinkled over the chicken beasts while they cooked in the sauce...Will definitely be making again...",,
1308564,3166,2009-12-29,5,"Fantastic! My only complaint is that 4 flattened chicken breasts can't fit in a normal sized skillet (or is it just that chicken breasts aren't ""normal"" sized anymore?) 
I had a 3lb pack of chicken with 5 breasts in it. I just cooked 3 as written and did 2 more after dinner.",,

1488930,3166,2010-02-02,5,"My family loved this recipe.  My son and husband thought it was as delicious as any Chicken Parmesan that they have had at an Italian restaurant. 
  I loved it too, because it was so easy to make and serve.  It is a definite keeper.
  I did oven fry my chicken breasts coated with a little low-fat mayo and then dipped in the Italian bread crumbs.  I think it probably cut down on the fat content quite a bit.  That is important for us senior citizens.
  Thank you for this lovely recipe.",,

1755374,3166,2010-12-12,3,"As a quick recipe for chicken parmesan, I think it was pretty good.  It was easy and tasty.  The most critical ingredient is the tomato sauce.  I used Barilla Marinara which is what I had on hand which had chunks of tomatoes in the sauce.  I preferred putting it under the broiler for a few moments to brown the cheese slightly and make it bubbly.  I would probably make it again  I have added a photo of my dish.",,
597669,3166,2010-12-13,4,"I really like the chicken breasts prepared this way and followed the instructions to the letter with the exception of the marinara sauce.  Instead, I made the low-fat alfredo sauce # 292890.  I also put it under the broiler for a few moments, this was delicious and thaks Marg for the recipe.",,

1497120,3166,2012-11-10,5,"This is so simple & tasty.  Truthfully, & I don't know why, but this is the 1st time I have ever made Chicken Parm.  I did add some sliced mushrooms & onions (sauteed) & then shoveled it all in the oven @350 x25 min & then turned the heat up to 385 x15 min when I added the fresh mozz.  It was sooo good & the chicken was soo tender.  Served w/spaghetti, fresh green beans & garlic bread sticks.  Thank you for sharing.",,
468351,3166,2014-03-27,5,"Easy and delicious!!  I used linguine instead of the angel hair pasta, and I used freshly shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Marg for posting this recipe.",,

440735,3166,2015-01-15,5,Easy and super good; it probably was extra good because I used butter!  I think the taste of the dish depends on your spaghetti sauce.  This dished impressed me!!!,,
213443,3166,2017-08-29,0,I have used this recipe with a few changes for a freezer meal. It works out great! My whole family enjoys it along with all the people I've shared it with! 5 Stars!!,,
91453,3168,2005-03-14,5,"this is oh-so-good! I scaled down to 2 servings, using 2 chicken breast halves, however I kept the crumb mixture at 4 servings. The amount is just perfect. I used freshly grated Parmesan and added 1 tsp garlic powder to the herb mixture. I served this with shell pasta and homemade tomato sauce. Thanks for the fantastic recipe, Marg! Edited to add -- I 'crumbed' the chicken in advance, chilled it on the parchment-lined baking tray for several hours; that way the crumbs adhere better.",,
133174,3168,2005-05-04,4,"Served these with a red pepper pasta and side salad.  I used 4 chicken breasts and seasoned cornflake crumbs for the breadcrumbs.  The remaining ingredients stayed the same.  Added Italian seasoning to the cheese/crumb mixture instead of the oregano and parsley.  Followed WaterMelon and 'crumbed' the chicken in advance, chilled it for several hours and then baked them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  I did increase the temperature to 425 degrees and they browned nicely.",,
139381,3168,2006-03-16,5,"This is one of my favorite baked breast recipes, and I use it often when I want more than just plain ole baked chicken.  It's simple.  It's delicious, and can be served with or without ""another topping"", such as cheese slices or tomato sauce, or alfredo sauce.  It's great on it's own with whatever sides you want to put with it.

5060,3168,2006-07-14,5,"mmmm Delicious!! I used freshly shredded parmesan and dry breadcrumbs, but not the fine one, next time I will use fine dry breadcrumbs, I'm sure they will stick better. Instead of the butter I used plain yoghurt, trying to save calories; baked the full 25 minutes. Loved the flavours of the seasonings in the coating. DH loved it and asked for it again.  Thanks for posting!!",,
11297,3168,2006-08-01,5,Another great chicken recipe for us. Very easy to make and goes well with either vegetables or a salad. A 'keeper' for us :),,

707707,3168,2008-01-02,5,This is a great recipe!!!  My wife and I made the recipe a little healthier by using muli-grain crakcers instead of breadcrumbs and substitued I can't believe it's not butter spray.  We served it with fresh steamed vegetables and would like to serve it with pasta in the future.  We are also planning on applying this recipe to panfish in the future.,,
638873,3168,2008-01-18,5,Delicious! Easy to make using basic ingredients. The chicken was very flavorful and tender. My husband and sons absolutely loved this. Thanks!,,
185285,3168,2008-01-23,5,"I'm rating this 5 stars for the perfect balance of ease & taste. I have used this recipe repeatedly both as a main meal and sliced to top our favorite italian pasta dishes.  When I'm short on time, I'll just use the Italian Seasoned Breadcrumb mix and it also works well.",,
593726,3168,2008-04-02,5,"Love it!  SO simple, I used panko instead of the breadcrumbs and used ms. dash italian meadley instead of the oregano and parsley as I didn't have the parsley on hand.  I followed the recipe other than that and it came out perfect!  Thank you!",,

572998,3168,2009-11-06,5,I loved this recipe. I set it for 2 servings (2 breast halves) and the amount of breading was perfect. Instead of cooking in the oven I did grilled them with indirect heat @ 350ish and they came out perfect.,,
126440,3168,2010-05-10,5,Very easy and great flavor.  I did use Progresso Italian bread crumbs.  May turn half way through next time as the bottom was crispier than the top.  Served with Recipe #225125 and dessert Recipe #216350.,,
526395,3173,2008-01-08,5,"I thought this was amazing, you could really taste the avocado in the rice and the dressing on the salmon was very very good.  It was a perfect balance of flavors, and not too salty like most wild rice dishes.  Very natural-tasting and elegant.",,
518581,3173,2010-02-18,4,Really nice flavor!  I added onion to the rice as well.  Thank you for posting.,,
290010,3173,2011-08-13,5,"I loved this.  I think the proportions are a little off, though.  I only used 1 lb of salmon which was perfect for the amount of tartar sauce and rice this recipe makes. Also, I followed the instructions on my wild rice bag which only called for 2 c. water.  Also, I will cut the onion back to 1/2 next time.",,
407338,3179,2008-04-07,5,"Delicious!  Particularly with cooked greens, soup or beans.  Crispy goodness in every bite!  Easy to prepare.  Made for Spring 2008 Flour Challenge in Cooking Photos Forum.",,

I underbake them just a bit (when the tops just barely start to get a light golden color, and they are very soft to the touch), when they cool and settle, they'll stay chewy. I have found that using dark brown sugar (instead of light brown) gives them a richer flavor, and adding a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg is a nice addition. Great recipe!!",,

121581,3180,2006-06-09,5,"I have made these cookies for years, just using the recipe off the oatmeal box, so thanks for posting it.  I discovered by chance, that by making the dough in advance, putting it in a zipper bag in the refrigerator, and baking later, that the cookies are even better ... something about the oats getting softer and the flavors distributing better (I think).  They are a hit either way, but this method makes serving ""fresh baked"" cookies a breeze.",,
82616,3180,2006-06-19,5,"Out of this world nummy !!! I ran into a couple problems (my  fault) I was short on margarine, so I used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup  crisco. I got busy mixing this up then realized I had no cinnamon ! sooo I sprinkled a bit of all spice, pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg in to give it some spice flavor of some kind. One thing I did which I do with ANY oatmeal raisin cookie recipe is, I plumped the raisins in hot water then drained them. This makes the raisins softer and juicier. This is a regular cookie recipe for me now!!! Thanks so much.",,
137911,3180,2006-07-30,5,A classic favorite of my family.  I love using the old fashioned oats instead of quick oats for a chewier cookie.  No rasins in mine tho - not a big fan of them. :-),,

That's what we love - CHEWY oatmeal raisin cookies.  I did have to lower my oven to 325 F and they baked for 10 minutes.  They did not spread much so you can load them up on your cookie sheet.  My daughter loved them too so the two of us made another batch the very next day for her to take to her co-op work place.  Great recipe!  Thank you.",,

If I use quick oats I do not add the full 3 cups because I find that they absorb more and the cookies turn out a tad on the dry side.  I much prefer the texture of the old fashioned oats anyway.   The recipe I have that my mom got off a Quaker's box when I was little is called ""Quaker's Best Oatmeal Cookies""  It eliminates one egg as well as 1/4 of the brown sugar.  it also adds an addition 1/4 cup of butter.  Everything else is the same.  My SIL uses this recipe, and I use the original quaker's best oatmeal cookie recipe and find that everyone prefers my version.<br/><br/>One last tip.  If you just use margarine, they tend to be quite a bit stickier and I have found that they tend to stick together when put in a container.  With butter they tend to be more crispy.  I have found that doing a margarine/ vegetable shortening combo brings out the best moist chewy, but not sticky texture that both my husband and I like in our cookies.",,

My goodness, are they lovely! Fragrant, and crisp on the outside/chewy on the inside. These cookies lend themselves well to alterations. Full of hearty whole grains, packed with fiber, low in fat, and absolutely delicious. Thanks!",,
91392,3180,2011-03-15,5,Easy and good.  Just what you are thinking of when you think oatmeal cookie.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and used .25 cup less sugar and half an egg less.  Would be good with any dried fruit or chocolate chips.,,

I even upped the recipe to make 500 cookies for our church picnic and they turned out amazingly, even with the abundant amount of cookie dough that we got out of them.

It calls for only 1/2c plus 6T of butter, and only 3/4 c brown sugar.  I was wondering why the cookies were turning out a lot lumpier than I remember.  I think this original recipe with more shortening and more brown sugar come out with a better texture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are my favorite OR cookies - they come out perfect every time.  I like my OR a little on the soft/chewy side, so I love the texture of these, and the taste cannot be beat - perfect amount of spice and raisins.",,

These just spread a little too much and were a bit on the greasy side. I think that&#039;s due to too much butter in the mix. If you use this recipe, reduce the butter by 2 T.",,

2001291424,3180,2016-12-10,0,"To those who condemn this recipe while pointing at current Quaker Oats box recipe, this recipe IS what the Quaker Oats recipe on the box used to be. I still use this one for a number of reasons. It is what I grew up eating. It works well. It uses an even number of sticks of butter (which is great convenience). The key to success with this recipe is using the proper creaming method (I start with room temperature butter or slightly colder and I beat the butter and sugar for nearly ten minutes) and then mixing the flour as little as possible to get a dough that doesn't develop gluten. If you make this recipe with the butter too soft you will get spreading cookies that will be a mess. I have developed type 2 diabetes not by eating fast food, but by home baking. This year I am going to try this recipe with carbalose flour, sukrin gold, erythritol, and about 1/4 cup of real sugar. (Sadly, even though sugar alcohols work well for most things, they neither brown nor carmelize. Cookies cannot be made into health food!)",,

But with 9 people and two dogs in a very small house, distractions sometimes win the day. Ok, that said, I've had to test a few subs to accommodate raisin allergies and low-sugar needs. Craisins are a no-brainer, no adjustments needed sub for the raisins, but the sugar is a bit trickier. Sugar substitutes don't melt or cook like white and brown sugar, so liquid adjustments are necessary. I've experimented with adding more egg white, more whole eggs, some canola oil. This morning's sub mix seems to be a winner, although I used more brown sugar and whole egg than I'd like - DH just won't be able to have quite as many as he'd like in a day. ;) The whole cup of brown sugar, half cup of sugar substitute, 3 whole eggs, and a 1/4 cup of canola oil.

The several versions I've tried all didn't spread out and I thought that odd - holding them to the same standard as Choc.Chip and other cookies. But the sheer &quot;mass' of all the raisins and oatmeal certainly contributes to that. As it turns out, that's how these recipes turn out in every case. I caused them to spread I bit by going to slight larger toggles scoop and gently pressing each dough-ball with a glass cup to about 2/3 its full height - just to get a little width to them (wetting and shaking off excess water helps and is fast). These cookies - though small in the 6 or 7 versions I've made - are perfect for kids. They taste incredible. I suppose who aren't happy with a thick small cookie can make the dough balls larger and press them more - the cookies will still come out with ample mass to please any O-R cookie lover. I live on O-R cookies as my treat and I've had a lot of them - these are right up there with the tasty ones. I also subbed Sun-Maid Fruit Bits for the raisins - those were great too.",,
