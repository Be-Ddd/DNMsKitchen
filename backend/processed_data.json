I made a few subsitutions in the recipe--instead of Marsala and chicken broth (which I didn't have)I used canned tomatoes and I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. It was great served with pasta.","When I made it I didn't have any wine, so I used a few drops of spiced vinegar and sugar.  Also, as a variation I made it with pork chops, except I substituted the broth with apple juice, water, spiced vinegar, a touch of mustard and cinnamon.  Also, very good.  Both ways, definitely a keeper.","This was easy enough to make (though, it took me longer because I could only cook two chicken filets at a time).  Very tasty.  If you use noodles, I would suggest to double (and perhaps triple) the amount of sauce (simmered chicken broth and marsala) at the end because it goes great over the noodles (I also recommend egg noodles for this dish).

In spite of its great rich flavor, this recipe is much lighter than I expected. Easy to put together.

I didn't have anything but white cooking wine and burgundy.  Did less than called for but upped the chicken broth.  Also didn't have fresh parmesan cheese :( but since I doubled the sauce, the chicken was almost floating.  Sprinkled the pre-grated parmesan and then covered with mozzarella.

We cut it down for 2 and it was one of the best meals we have had in awhile.","This was delicious !  I used 4 chicken breasts (which when cut and pounded made 8 nice pieces) and left all the other ingredient amounts the same.  I subbed fontina for the mozzarella.  The chicken comes out so tender and tasty, and I served it on linguini. My husband rated this as a restaurant-quality meal - thank you for sharing.","This was AMAZING with a few minor changes. I only used 6 breast halves, but the same amount of the sauce. I sauteed onions and garlic in the same pan after I removed the mushrooms.  To the sauce mixture I added dried oregano and thyme and added back the onions and garlic to let it all reduce together.    I served with mashed potatoes.","I have made this recipe and saut&eacute;ed the green onions with the mushrooms.

(3) The 15 min prep time listed is quite wrong...by the time I chopped the chicken, the broccoli, the onion, minced the garlic, grated the mozzarella, made the sauce ... well,you get the picture. It took me almost an hour to prepare. But it was well worth the effort and I will definitely make this again -- my family LOVED it.","I really liked this too.  I sprinkles with alot of red pepper flakes at the table - can't add in as I have little people to feed.  I will definatly make this again.","This is not bad.  I think if I made it again, I would skip the chicken broth all together and just just use 3 cups of milk.  (Just a straight white sauce).  I wasn't too thrilled with the taste of the sauce.  I used \"express\" lasagna noodles (ones that you don't have to pre-boil), and it didn't work that well in this recipe.\r\nIt made the noodles very tough - hard to even cut!\r\nSassy.","Wonderful blend of tastes. We love cheese so this dish hit the spot. Prep time was more like 35 minutes. I used whole leg quarters and since I am on low carb diet left out the noodles. Did not increase sauce since I did not use noodles. Careful with the nutmeg, do NOT add more than a pinch, or it will change the taste of the dish.","This was a good recipe, but I thought the sauce was a little bland. I added extra ground red pepper, black pepper, and garlic powder to try and give it a boost.  I took Lennie's advice and made 1 1\/2 times the amount of sauce.  It was about the perfect amount. I also added about twice the amount of minced garlic to the chicken cubes for extra flavor.  Overall, I think this is a good recipe, and I will make it again with minor seasoning changes.","I had a little trouble on this recipe with the \"cheeses\" on the directions list.  I made the mistake of adding the shredded cheese to the flour and  butter mixture instead of the parmesan, but it turned out okay. Just a little \"gooier\".  Gooey is ALWAYS good in my book!

It was gone in a flash, to rave reviews! Since i like my cakes a little less sweet I cut back the sugar to 1\/12 cups in the cake, and also cut the oil back to 1 1\/4 cups. In addition I only used about 3\/4 of a box of powdered sugar in the frosting, and also used neufchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese. It still came out superb!

I have to say your recipe is perfection.  I made this for a baby's first birthday and used part of the batter in a little 6 inch pan for the baby (so she could maul it, which she did and it was adorable) - and put the remainder in a standard tube pan for the adults.  I had omitted the nuts because of the baby, but topped the large cake with toasted pecans. Everyone raved about it, and had 2nds.  People love to add all kinds of things to carrot cake (raisins, pineapple etc), and those are ok - but I really prefer the elegance and texture of your recipe.  I grated the carrots by hand (I really wish I owned a food processor), on the tiny tiny side, so basically had pulp - it works out to be about 3 heaping cups, if anyone needs that as comparison.  The texture of the cake was like velvet, very moist but not heavy, as this type of cake can be.  Obviously I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for posting it, and I'm sure I'll never again use any other carrot cake recipe... oh one more thing, this recipe is super easy and I think even a novice baker would have success.  The only thing that took any time at all, was grating the carrots, and if you have a food processor, that would only take a few minutes.

It is like a sweet banana bread elevated to cake status.... simply delicious! I wouldn't change a thing and I will be making this one again!

Even with my substitutions the cake still came out so moist and perfect!

Went together perfectly!","Step 11 states to \"drizzle glaze over top and down side of cake\", but WHAT glaze? I'd already used all the ingredients in the cake, and hadn't set aside anything to use to make a glaze. While it smelled fabulous while baking, and had a moist, dense texture, the flavor didn't measure up. I did substitue unsalted butter for the margarine, and generic almonds instead of Dole brand (but I would think the butter would have made it better, not worse). I did make my own glaze, which was fine, but it really didn't help the cake.","This was a lovely banana cake! I couldn't taste the almond but it didn't really matter.","We absolutely loved this!  No, the almond didn't really come through but I think lent a real smoothness to this delicious cake.  I added an extra banana so probably should have upped the baking soda a bit, but it made for such a moist, dense cake I can't complain!  Used the glaze from recipe 27144 - to die for!

The cake is moist and the flavor is delicious.  I did make it the night before to let the flavor intensify.  I used a 10 inch angel food pan and I poured a chocolate glaze over the top.  There was not a piece left.  I already have requests from other family members for their birthday.  Thanks for a great recipe.","What a great tasting cake! Instead of margarine used crisco, used almond extract, also didn't toast the almond just cut them fine.  I took this to a graduation party and it was liked by many people. Thanks for helping me use up some old bananas!","What a find! A great way to use up all of those spotty bananas instead of another loaf of banana bread. I left mine unadorned. It is lovely and sweet enough without any icing or glaze. This cake has a fine crumb and is very moist. I subbed out the almonds and almond liqueur\/extract for banana liqueur, vanilla and a drop of orange extract; and added 1\/4 or so cup of wheat germ. Like another reviewer I used Crisco... it was what I had on hand. Took the full 50 minutes in my oven. Just a lovely cake.","A wonderful cake.  Did not have almonds, use pecans.  Used Dutch cocoa.  A moist not too sweet cake.  Served plain to family. A dusting of powdered sugar would be nice for company presentation.  Next time I'll use filberts (hazelnuts) and Frangelico.","This was awesome!

Great savory flavoring that is perfect without cheese (in fact, cheese might ruin this recipe in my opinion).  Both my husband and I devoured these.

I enjoyed the spiciness very much, as my family is used to eating very spicy Indian dishes. However, if you are not into extremely spicy foods, I suggest reducing the chili paste.\r\n\r\n~Sashwat","Great recipe for anyone who like it as close as it come to the real thing! Very simple to make and you can find all the ingredents in your local supermarket! I myself would cut back on the white pepper and add a little bit of hot oil (not to much)! I would also add about 1 1\/2 tbls more of vineger. (or to taste) add a little more meat and you can serve with a bowl of white rice with steamed veggies for a meal of its own.","my family like the bamboo shoots whole. but we love your recipe","My boyfriend and i were very pleased with this recipe. he is half chinese so he knows the good stuff. the only thing we changed was the amount of chili paste. we only put one tablespoon instead of 2. the soup is very very spicy with 2 tblsp's. other than that it was great. the flavor is awesome. my boyfriend said that it tasted just like his mom's. that is a great compliment.\r\namity","this was pretty good on the whole. a few things: the cornstarch was waaay too much and it made the soup unbearably thick, less soupy and more mealie. i'll probably use just three tablespoons next time, perhaps less. the two tablespoons of chili sauce were also too much, just one would suffice. otherwise, the recipe is good. i omitted the pork and used less egg. i couldn't find black fungus so used dried wild mushrooms which worked out just fine. the soup is very filling and will have your scalp sweating by the time you're done.","Excellent recipe, however I used only one egg & cut back on the corn starch. I've also used canned chinese stir-fry vegetables (bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, mushrooms & bean sprouts) & frozen shrimp in this soup for variation & ease.","With a few adjustments this is the best I have ever made.  I've searched far and wide for a good recipe, and here it is.  I added two additional cups of broth.  Used 2 tablespoons of corn starch, two eggs, and a splash more vinegar.  I agree that using the two tablespoons of chili sauce makes it really really hot, but I like it that way.  Served it with sticky rice.  It was tremendous.  What a find.  Thanks for posting this recipe.","This recipe is the bomb!  This is the closest to the restaurant kind that I've ever encountered.  It has a permanent home in my personal recipe box now.  As said in earlier posts, I would definitely only recommend using 1 Tbsp. of the chili sauce instead of 2 Tbsp.  Also, only 4 Tbsp. of the corn starch is needed.  Otherwise, it'll congeal pretty quickly.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone seeking \"the real thing.\"","I found this to be just great!  I cut the recipe in half, and I took some of the others' advice and reduced the cornstarch (for half the recipe I only used 1 Tbsp.  I also did not use the black fungus, used rice vinegar instead of white, and only used 1 egg.  This tasted like I was eating it at a restaurant...I served it with steamed dumplings and Pad Thai as the main course.","Kick ass!  I love hot and sour soup and I could live on it!  This recipe is \"oooh la la.\" \r\n\r\nHere's what I did different:  halfed the amount of garlic and chili paste (and that's saying a lot b\/c I love me some HOT stuff), and halfed the amount of cornstarch.  I doubled the amount of soy, vinegar and sesame oil.  I also increased the egg and tofu amount a tiny bit (b\/c I excluded the yolks in half the eggs I used and I love tofu).  USE YOUR OWN VARIATION AND ENJOY - IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!!","With a few adjustments, this is about perfect.  Like others, I found 1 tbsp. of garlic and red chile paste provided plenty of punch and 2 tbsp. cornstarch was right.  I used 4 eggs, but next time I'll use two.  The vegetables can be varied at will.  I used Golden Needles, but no fungus and regular mushrooms instead of the straw.  We did not care for water chestnuts in the soup and I wouldn't use them next time.  And there WILL be a next time, because I am now done looking for the Hot and Sour Soup of my dreams.","WOW!  This really IS the BEST!!!!  I took others advice, and only used 1 Tbsp. of the chili paste, and it was more than enough.  I don't like tofu, so I just used twice as much of the mushrooms.  If you're looking for the best, this is it!","Also loved this recipe.  Cut back on the eggs (used 3) and omitted pork and tofu.  Added a splash more vinegar an used reconstituted shiitake's.  Yum!  Perfect for killing a cold.","Way too hot!  Cut the chili paste dramatically if you don't want to burn your lips!  I ruined the whole batch by following the directions exactly.  I wish I had followed the other reviewers' advice!","I made this as it is listed.  I really enjoyed it and will make it again soon.","I apologize for taking so long to review this recipe as I have made this now at least 3 times. I did make some changes but only because we like our soup not quit as thick as what this recipe calls for. Therefore I used 4 tbs of cornstarch and 2 eggs. I did not think that the chili sauce needed to be adjusted. We all agreed that it had just the right amount of heat. My daughter enjoys this so much that she now fixes a big pot of it on the weekends (minus all the meat and veggies) and eats it for lunch through out the week. This is a prize recipe.","I just made this soup.........I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  It is soooo good!  I made it as stated in the recipe except I only put 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste.  This is even better than any hot sour soup I've had at Chinese restaurants!  Thanks for this keeper!","This is the first time I've left a review.  Could not resist because this soup was so good.  I always order Hot & Sour soup at chinese restaurants, it's my favourite.  And I've tried to make it from scratch several times unsuccessfully.  This recipe was easy and the ultimate Hot & Sour soup.  I will never look further for a recipe.  The changes I made were to use 1.5 tbsp of chili paste (I like spice but would reduce further if not used to it), 2 eggs and 3 tbsp of cornstarch, no pork, no straw mushrooms and substituted dried porcini mushrooms for the dried black fungus. Next time I'd try to find the dried black fungus and cut the water chestnuts into smaller pieces. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.","Tastse surpasses any found in Chinese restaurant!  Presents well.  Simple to make.\r\nI cut hot pepper by 50%, omitted the pork.  Am striving to reduce the sodium.","I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.I cut the chili paste in half,used less cornstarch , 2 eggs and substituted chicken for pork. It had enough heat, but each person could add more chili sauce if desired. I will make this again.","We make this recipe OFTEN! It is the best we've ever tasted. Modifications:\r\n1.Double recipe and freeze it.\r\n2. Leave out eggs until ready to eat.\r\n3. Black pepper instead of white.\r\n4. Use only 5 TBSP cornstarch in doubled recipe.\r\n5. Leave out bamboo shoots.\r\n6. Use whatever kind of mushrooms are available. Usually a mix of several kinds.\r\n7. Rice vinegar instead of white.\r\n8. Leave out black fungus.","Excellent !","Believe everything. I made this soup a week ago and I'm about to make it again, so I thought I would post. Excellent soup. I'm not much of a cook so I just went through the comments and modified the recipe to my liking based on what others said. I was very impressed with the way it turned out, will make often.","Wonderful recipe with the modifications others have suggested (less chili paste, cornstarch, egg; a slight bit more vinegar - I used rice vinegar. I also reduced the soy sauce to 1 T). Also, to make things even easier, I use canned straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots and baby corn, and reconstituted shiitake mushrooms. I also omitted the pork and water chestnuts. If I have more time, I like to add the black fungus, and tiger lily buds (golden needles).","I'm so happy to have found this soup!  I happily used 2 T of garlic chili sauce - I like my lips to be a little numb when I finish my Hot and Sour Soup!  I only used 1 egg and didn't have any dried black fungus.  I also used about 8 oz of tofu and that was plenty for us.  My husband and son were so impressed, they figured the local Chinese restaurant could use me for a chef. Thanks for posting!","Very good !! I didn't have chili  paste so used 2 large cloves of garlic and a heaping 1\/2 tsp. of Italian pepper seeds. That was just the right amount of heat for us. 1 rounded Tbsp. of cornstarch was perfect. Did use about 1\/2 tsp. of pepper but will omit it next time. The bite was harsh. I will also omit the egg. I don't believe it adds to the flavor and the broth would be much more appealing to the eye without it. Did garnish with chopped Cilantro. It added a nice flavor and additional color.","This is a GREAT recipe. Super easy to make, and tastes better than the soup in most of the chinese restaurants Ive been to!","AWESOME !!!!! I will never buy  hot & sour soup  from  a  restaraunt  again !\r\ni added some wasabi bean sauce & and japanese  pepper pods  to  heat  it  up  a bit more but   apart  from  that it  was SPOT ON","This was outstanding.  I reduced a few ingredients: 1 tb chile sauce, 1\/2 pkg of tofu, 3 tb cornstarch and 3 eggs.  And I didn't use the fungus.  It was fabulous and surprisingly easy - I have saved this in my favorites!","This was an awesome recipe.  I was looking for something that replicated a soup that my fiance and I had in Hong Kong and with a few additions this recipe was perfect.  Used more broth and less cornstarch.  Added cilantro, bean sprouts, half the chili paste, and used regular mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms.  Next time I think I will make it thicker and possibly add noodles in place of tofu.  My fiance is already begging me to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe Nancy!","Nancy, this was a super recipe!  We made our Christmas Dinner this year an Asian theme.  (Each year we do something different, to make each year memorable).  This year was so successful.  My sons thought the soup was divine!  Everyone raved over it.  We did add the left-over pork filling from the egg rolls to it, as we did not want to waste anything.  It actually gave some additional texture and color, with the grated carrots.  We did not use 4 eggs, but cut that amount in half.  Also, we substituted the red chile paste with cayenne pepper.  All of it tasted better than any restaurant we have been to in the USA and abroad.  Thanks again for the great and  fairly quick recipe.","I can't believe how great this recipe is!  It tastes just like the hot and sour soup I have been craving, but can't have in the UK b\/c we can't afford to eat out.  \r\n\r\nI left out the pork, eggs, carrot, water chestnut, and black fungus.  It was delicious.  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and did not find the soup thick at all.\r\n\r\nNext time I'll try to find golden needles and black fungus, and then maybe open a Chinese restaurant!  \r\n\r\nThanks for a great recipe that I'll be sharing with family and friends!","I made this recipe exactly how it is written (except omitting the tofu), and it turned out pretty good. I really like the restaurant version of hot & sour soup, and this had a little different taste, but VERY close! I think the ingredients that threw the flavor off was the mushrooms. I used canned shiitake & straw mushroom (only way I could find them) and was not impress with the flavor & texture it gave. Next attempt will be with fresh button mushrooms...which I've had at a couple Chinese restaurants. Thanks so much!!","Takes a bit of time to make, but it is one of the greats for hot and sour.","Absolutely delicious!  Relying on some of the other reviews, I used only 1 tsp. of cornstarch and 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste, and when taste-testing it was not spicy enough (my family likes strong taste) so I ended up using 2 tbsp paste as the recipe said.  I also increased the soy to 3 tbsp and used 1\/3 cup rice vinegar in place of 1\/4 cup white vinegar.  I also used low-sodium soy sauce, which worked fine.  This was wonderful, flavorful and very authentic-tasting.  Thanks for a great recipe!","I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I thought with all the positive reviews here it would be restaurant-quality. Boy was I wrong!\n\nI followed this recipe exactly, omitting the water chestnut and carrots, but I still found it too bitter. I would back off on the vinegar but I can't think of any other way to improve this recipe. It was just plain awful! I will pay $1 for a cup of awesome authentic hot & sour at my local Chinese restaurant from now on.","I can't believe I have never left a rating on this absolutely fabulous recipe.  I've made it for years and everyone just raves over it. The recipe has been passed out numerous times. It is the BEST hot and sour soup I have ever had and that includes in Chinese restaurants.  It is my go to recipe, period. \r\nWe like it hot so I used 3 tablespoons of the garlic\/chili sauce. I omitted the carrots and used 2 beaten eggs instead of the more healthy egg substitute. Regarding the cornstarch, I just keep adding the slurry until it looks to be the right consistency.  Everything else is as the recipe recommends....including the black fungus...or wood ear mushrooms. \r\nThanks so much, Nancy.","I just finished making this for dinner tonight and just had to taste it.  What a flavor sensation. I didn't see where it said to add the carrots so I put them in with the bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts.   I used 1 T  garlic red chili sauce, 1\/4 c. egg substitute and only had button mushrooms and dried shitake and  also no tofu.   This is one dynamite hot and sour soup.  I can't wait until I have all the correct ingredients.  This is great as I made it though.","It was just what we were looking for!  I didn't have some of the mushrooms and skipped the tofu but it was great!  We'll definitely be making this recipe again.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, we cut back the Chili to 1.5 tbsp and it was just the right heat.","Oh. My. This is the holy grail of Hot and Sour Soup. Fried up a batch of wonton strips and everybody had seconds. This is a definite keeper.","When I visited China I ate a lot of hot and sour soup, mostly because I could be more sure of the ingredients!  This is the closest I've found to the taste of the soup there, better than any restaurant soup I've tried.  I make it with extra garlic chile mix and no meat.  Only problem is, I haven't found dried black fungus.  Maybe it would be even better?","We love to order hot and sour soup in the restaurant, so I was a bit leary of trying this at home.  I knew my family would be tough to please when it came to this soup.  I read through the instructions and thought I will try it.  I am so glad I did....this is so good.  I used my homemade chicken stock, and instead of straw mushrooms I used button mushrooms (what I had on hand), otherwise followed your recipe exactly.  We really loved this and I plan on making this quite often when we make a chinese style meal.  Thank you so much for posting this.","Just as good as any Chinese restaurant soup!  Excellent flavor and overall taste!","Ok so this is an ok recipe I added some stuff and mine tastes like it came from a restaurant black fungus lily flower buds and a few other things and it perfect","great flavor - I made it fully vegan so omitted the pork and egg and used vegetarian base.  I would def. tone down the heat a bit for most audiences.  I love the spice but it was even hot for me.","We really enjoyed this soup. My 15y\/o daughter has been jonesing for Hot & Sour soup so off I went to find a recipe. My 14 LOVED it, the grownups did too! I used 2 eggs, all dried mushrooms which I hydrated, added both chicken and tofu. I was not thick from the corn starch or too salty or too tangy from the vinegar. It was a golden brown color and very appealing.  Super good on day 2 for lunch! It's a winner all the way around.

Apparently this is from the meringue and is completely normal, it did not change the taste of the pie at all. I also used a store bought graham cracker pie crust which worked just fine. It set almost immediately and cut into real slices. Great recipe.","I didn't put the Meringue on top of the pie because we don't like it, but make it as a Chocolate Cream Pie...  We LOVED this pie!  Thick and rich chocolate.  Perfect with some Cool Whip on top... Yum!","This didn't turn out good for me either, same as Katybird.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made sure to stir continuously using a wooden spoon in a non-stick pan on medium heat and I couldn't even let it come to a boil as it was thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan.  So I went ahead and put half into a bowl with the egg yolks stirred well return egg mixture to pan, still stirring continuously it was starting to smooth out but then before it could reach boiling point, it started thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan again and cramping my hand.

A few of them even said, it was the best crab dip they ever tasted!!!","made this for superbowl sunday - everyone RAVED about how wonderful it was!!!  several people even asked for the recipe.  positively THE BEST crab dip I have ever had!!!!!  A new staple in my recipe book!!!!","Absolutely fantastic!!  I had to use pre-packaged crab meat as fresh was unavailable, and it turned out great!  When it finished cooking, I put in into a hollowed out bread loaf (french bread), and used the left over bread cut up as dipping pieces - WOW!!  This was a hit with my guests!  I will definately make this again.","This has replaced my staple crab dip and I may not make it again.","This was excellent.  I made for a work pot luck and it was scarfed down in no time.  I used imitation crab meat , fresh minced garlic and substituted Tex-Mex cheese for the cheddar.  I will make this again for sure.  Easy and delicious.","I used 1\/2 imitation crab and 1\/2 salad sized shrimp and added some old bay seasoning for some spice.

The way a dip should be!","This was wonderful, and so easy to make I could almost do it with my eyes closed! I tried to keep this lower fat to stay close to my diet, so I used fat-free mayo, fat-free cream cheese, and fat-free cheddar in this, and it still tasted fantastic! I did go ahead and mix all the cheese into the dip before heating since fat-free cheese doesn't like to melt on top but will when it is stirred into a dish. It warmed up very nicely and was great on crackers! Thanks for a great recipe!","The kids & I had this for supper last night, using fresh broccoli for dipping. I had to use 2 cans of drained crab meat (4.25oz each), which made the texture a bit weird, but the flavor was divine. I look forward to someday making this with fresh crabmeat. The combo with the broccoli flavor was a good one, but I might try celery next time to get more of the solo dip flavor.","This dip was a big hit during Thanksgiving.  I served it with some toasted bread as an appetizer and my guest just loved it.  I used imitation crab meat instead and it was still GREAT!  ","Thanks for the wonderful recipe! I used fresh Dungeness crab and everyone loved it! This recipe is definitely a keeper!","This was gone in a matter of minutes on x-mas eve.  I too used imitation crab meat, and it tasted like the real deal!  I baked a loaf of french bread for dipping, yummy!","Excellent crab dip. Rich and creamy. The worcestershire really adds to the flavor. We spread this on our favorite crackers and that was our dinner. Yummy!!

I would definitely add diced onions, more garlic, and some cayenne or something to give it a kick...","I needed another dip for a party that I was having and I made this one.  It was a big hit and my party guests kept talking about it all night. ","Amazing crab dip! I served this as sort of a side dish with some broiled shrimp and we really enjoyed the flavor. I didn't change a thing, it isn't necessary. Thanks for posting.","After all the great reviews this has received, I was expecting an out of this world dip.  However, I was very disappointed with the final result when I prepared this.  It came out really soupy and was very greasy...I'm not sure why as I only lightly greased the casserole.  I might try this again to see if I get different results...if so, I'll revise my review.

It was gone in no time, and they were still asking for more!  The only change I made was adding about 3\/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese.  Very, very yumpy....  Thanks for the great recipe!","Great recipe!  It went very quickly at my recent dinner party.  I did use 1 clove of garlic, minced, salt, about a tablespoon of minced onion, and a dash of hot pepper sauce.  I didn't have any milk, but it didn't seem to need it.  I also added a little extra cheddar cheese.","This is a fairly good dip but it needed more flavor and I would have liked it to have been a little hotter.  Maybe I'll add hot sauce next time as another reviewer suggested.  I did substitute minced garlic for the garlic salt, doubled the recipe, and heated it in my crockpot for about 3 hours.","I brought this to a hurricane party, and I swear I turned around and it was gone! Everyone ate the dip as fast as I put in on the table! People were ranting and raving about how good it was. Thank you so much for your post!","This was a pretty good dip, but I find that it is lacking something and I just don't know what. The tangy\/sour flavor from the cream cheese,sour cream and lemon juice was certainly overpowering the whole dip. It needed something with a spicy taste, I think, to balance the flavor. Also, The cheese I had melted on top(cheddar) had a layer of oil from cooking.After it had cooled a little the whole top layer of cheese came off in one piece. Maybe next time (if I remake it)I will mix all the cheese in to the main mix. Other than those small flaws it was edible and the flavor of the crab meat really came through.","this is the best I've had in a long time. just needed a little pinch of red pepper to my taste.","This crab dip was an absolute hit\r\nI made this for a barbaque this labor day it was so easy and fast to prepare.

I want to say thanks for making me look so good.   \r\n","A BIT HIT!!!! This is absolutely fantastic. I made this for Thanksgiving guest and served with different types of gourmet crackers. Everyone kept saying how wonderful this was. Needless to say it went fast. I doubled the ingredients to make twice as much and all the measurements worked fine. I did add a little more cheddar cheese to the dip...just about 2 more TBSP because I love cheese and apparently so does everyone else. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!","Very tasty crab dip!  I liked the flavor added by the Worcestershire sauce.  It was good cold too.","I tripled this recipe. I used the imitation crab meat as it was $18.00 a pound for crabmeat and you can only buy it by the pound I did not want to spend $36.00 on one ingredient. My daughter tasted it the morning I took it out of the oven and told me, \"Mom, they are going to LOVE this.\"  Sure enough they did. I took it to monthly birthday celbration at 8:00 AM by 8:55 AM it was GONE! People were eating it like it was a cassarole. I didn't even get to taste it! It was fantastic, evidently!!!I a ton of emails asking for the recipe. I followed the recipe to a tee except that I put probably twice as much cheese as the recipe called for.","This is Delicious and really good!  Only thing I did different was to use 2 6oz. cans pink crabmeat, no lemon juice, milk, or cheddar(don't like it).  I sprinkled top with Old Bay.  This tastes good even cold!!!","I made this yesterday to take to Christmas Eve dinner at my in-laws.  It was really good and everyone really liked it.  I followed the directions exactly except I used 2 cans of lump crab meat and didn't have any dry or even dejon mustard, so I subbed a squirt of yellow mustard.  I probably used quarter cup of cheese in the dip and another 1\/2 cup on top.  I took a bag of pita chips to dip and kept going back for more!  I am going to make this again for my new years eve party!  Thanks for great recipe!","Something about this dip just didn't work for us.  It lacked a bit on flavor and was too sour\/tangy.  I'd have to tweak it a bit to suit our tastes.  It went largely untouched at our last gathering.","Very good! I doubled it and halved the lemon juice...I am glad I did because I think it would have been overpowering. I added extra Worcestershire and cheddar, some Old Bay, some cayenne pepper and white pepper. I don't know if it's \"rave-worthy\" but it is definitely good dip! I used reduced fat cream cheese and mayo.","I made this dip for New Year's Eve.  Added some old bay, onion powder, pepper, and extra worcestershire sauce to give it a little punch.  I used about 3\/4 lb. of fresh backfin crabmeat.\n\nI didn't like it hot!  Right out of the oven, it seemed bland.  HOWEVER, after sitting in the refrigerator overnight, I decided to spread it on club crackers just because I didn't want to waste it.  Oh how wonderful it is as a cold spread!!!   I ate the whole thing in two days time!!  Who knows, maybe slightly heating it at this point, with the flavors all mingled, it might be good hot.  I will remember this as a wonderful cold spread!","Love this, and have made it several times.","I absolutely loved this recipe. I added some finely chopped green onions and used fresh pressed garlic.  The worcestershire sauce added a wonderful flavor for this delicious dip.

I am doubling the recipe and taking it to a birthday\/ football party today.  GO COLTS!","Yummy! We made this with french bread and ate the whole thing!","Mt husband loved this recipe! I doubled the recipe which turned out fine. It also re-heated well the next day. Next time I will use bread for dipping.","Great, I added green onions and used pepperjack cheese to make it spicier.","This is sooooo good.  Very rich but so delicious.  We made this for Christmas Eve and it was gone in no time.  I will be making this many times over.  Thank you for this yummy recipe.....Stephanie","This was a total hit at my new years eve party.  I only bought enough stuff to make one and could have bought enough for three. This was the first to go.  Thanks, this will be added to my appetizer recipes.","This was GREAT!!! Even dear old Dad\r\n(who hates dips) said he could make a meal of this.  The only thing I did different was to use a little fresh garlic and fresh lime juice (didn't have lemon on hand).  Thanks of a wonderful appy recipe!","I loved this dish. My dear old dad found it on here and made it for my boyfriend and I for supper. It was so delicious! Dad likes it better the next day after it has chilled in the refrigerator over night and all of the flavors have blended. Served hot or cold its a hit!","I prepared this dip ahead of time and baked it while everyone was in the kitchen enjoying all the snacks at my party. Soon the whole place smelled wonderful and they ate it right up and couldn't stop raving about it! Thanks for the great recipe!","What a waste of crab!  Way too tangy flavor that drowns out the crab. Yuch!","I made this for my family during the Superbowl. They loved it and it was a festive addition to the usual snacks. We had leftovers and it was just as yummy cold. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making it again.","Made this for a baby shower and it was a HUGE HIT! I didn't have worcester sauce so I used a couple dashes of soy sauce, also I didn't mely cheese on the top, but I did mix it all in and it turned out wonderful! It was one of the first things to go.","Oh, MYmymymymymymy..... This could become a VERY dangerous addiction! I made this for my husband and his friends who stopped by yesterday and they couldn't shut up about it. ;)  I took my portion to the living room where I could feast upon it in peace and make barely-subdued moaning noises and euphoric facial expressions without being gossiped about later. Anyway, I used backfin crab and it seemed a little fishy, so next time I'll go for higher quality. I used a pre-shredded cheddar and for the milk, used 1\/2 and 1\/2. Everything else I did as indicated. The combination of ingredients was just wonderful and I can't wait to make this again.  Thank you to Lee and crabplace.com!","This is very tasty.  It tastes great right out of the oven, but the leftovers were even better the next day after being warmed up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!","A quintessential party dip - creamy, cheesy, and crabby! I used backfin crab meat in mine. Such a snap to prepare and everyone loved it.","This was very good. Mine didn't set up very well until after it had cooled. However, nobody seemed to mind because it tasted great!","A nice basic recipe for warm crab dip. We added some chopped artichokes and served with whole wheat crackers. I wish I had added some Old Bay, it would have added a nice kick. I did add a few drops of Tabasco sauce. Yummy!","Fantastic and easy!  I added Old Bay and substituted fresh grated Asiago cheese, then used low fat mayo, sour cream, and cream cheese.  I will definitely make this again!","Great tasting dip!  My DW whipped it up and we just about fell into the dish fighting to get there first!  Served it with some rippled potato chips and bagel chips.  It's a real treat for us!","Great recipe. I got this recipe from an old freind from Maryland back in the early eighties. Her husband was a crabber and knew what tasted good. Still a great tasting dip!","This was delicious and super simple to make. However, I felt like it was missing something. Maybe I'll add some Old Bay next time. Thanks for sharing.","With all these great reviews I hate to be the one who has something negative to say, but my family and I didn't really care for this recipe as written.  I doubled the recipe, and didn't use the cheddar cheese, that was the only change I made, and we all thought it was very bland.  Before baking, I added a lot of old bay (maybe a ts or 2) and hot sauce (maybe 3 or 4 Tb) and we finially liked it.  I mixed it up the day before, and baked it covered for an hour, then uncovered for 20 minutes, with a little old bay sprinkled on top.  After those changes it was fantastic.  Thanks for posting anyway, I doubt I'll ever make crab dip any other way.","This has been my go-to recipe for the past 6+ years! It's the perfect accompaniment to crab...not too overpowering. Good bread is necessary! The only two additions I make are 2 tbsp grated onion mixed in with everything else and a sprinkling of Old Bay (or J.O.'s) on the top before baking. NOTE: If you pick the crabs yourself and they have been steamed in Old Bay, DO NOT add the old bay or garlic salt or it gets WAY TOO SALTY!) If you want to freeze to save for another night, be sure to bake it but not for the whole time\u2014closer to 20\/25 mins\u2014then you can reheat in the microwave or toaster.

Made it tonight for dinner, and we LOVED it!  I used fat free, evaporated milk, instead of whipping cream (as another reviewer suggested), as the soup was still creamy, hearty and delicious.  I had no parsley, so I omitted it.  I used Old Bay seasoning, lemon pepper, and salt to season, but felt something was missing so I added a good tablespoon or two, of Emerils original seasoning.  That did the trick.  If you don't have Emeril's, I think a good spice mix of garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, paprika and extra salt will give it an extra kick that puts it over the top.  I served it hot with some extra shredded cheddar over the top.  I will definitely be making this to impress at my next dinner party!","Absolutely stellar.  Added 1 1\/2 T. Essence and omitted lemon pepper.  Made the entire soup, minus crabmeat, the day before.  All I had to do was add crab and heat.  Decadent and marvelous.","Great bisque!!!\r\nMy wife is lactose intolerant so I made some adjustments and added a couple goodies to fill in the sauce. I used 1.5c milk, 2.5c chicken broth and omitted the whipping cream and sherry. I sauteed 1\/2c fine chopped onions in the butter, added 1c cooked, diced potatos (red) and 1c white corn to the finished sauce. There were no complaints or leftovers!  What a treat!!!","So yummy! I make this all the time but i lighten it up a bit. I use Fat free milk, fat free half and half, and  2% sharp cheddar and it comes out amazing! I also added a potato to make it more\" chowder-like\". But over all Awesome recipe! Company loves it too!!","This is excellently flavored!  It was a great appetizer to a special dinner I prepared for company.  I too added in some potatoes just because. Rich and delicious and loaded with crab!","Looks like I may be the only one who isn't blown away by this recipe.  I tried it because it looked simple.  Indeed, the end result did not quite taste like the crab bisque I usually have in restaurants.  The only thing that made it taste like crab bisque was the sherry. I feel that it lacks something but still have not quite found out what it is lacking.

I got a bit over 9 half-pints.  I didn't peel and core my pears, I just removed the stem and blossom end, cooked, and put through a sieve.  I think this gave me more pulp than if you peel and core them.  I also used apple cider instead of the apple juice.  My end product is a medium brown color.  Thanks for a great recipe!","This is Wonderful!!!  I made two batches of it.  The first one just like the recipe reads, and it is delicious.  The second batch, I left 1\/3 of the pears chopped and pureed the rest.  I combined them just  before canning them.  That way the butter had fruit chunks in it.  It was great both ways.

It's tasteless without a lot of salt.  My DH thought it was okay.  I did change the recipe a little, though, to make it a bit easier. 1) To shorten the amount of cooking time, I pricked each potato a few times with a fork, and then microwaved them between two moist paper towels for about 6-8 minutes, or until starting to get soft.  I cut them into chunks (using a pot holder, of course).  I always leave the skin on as it doesn't take away from the taste and does add a little nutrition.  2) I didn't clean the pan between cooking the potatoes and onions and cooking it with the eggs and I had no problem.  I did add about 2 Tbsp. of oil first, though.  3) I added about 1 1\/2 - 2 tsp. of salt.  4) I added some sliced scallions\/green onions for color.  5) I cooked the omelet on high and waited a few minutes so that I only had to cook each side once.","this is exactly the way that my spanish friends taught me to make this. great recipe. make sure people realize that the high fat count is a bit lower because you drain off most of the oil after the potatoes are cooked.","This is exactly like the dish I was served all across Spain.  No, it is not the most flavorful thing in the world, but it is good and most definitely authentic.","I've made this many, many times.  It's delicious, but I do not think you need to add the potato slices one by one to avoid sticking.  Just drop the potato slices into the skillet and stir often to prevent burning and sticking.  I've also changed this recipe up a bit by adding half a chopped Cubanelle\/Italian pepper, or by adding chorizo or by adding sliced green olives.  Very authentic dish from Spain and simple to make.  Thanks for posting!","I've made a very similar recipe from an authentic source in the high school Spanish classes that I teach.  Tips:  First, just use ordinary olive oil, not an extra virgin, as if won't be able to take the heat.  To avoid crispy potatoes, be sure the oil is at the right temperature (potatoes should cook slowly when dropped in, and shouldn't sound like french fries in a deep frier) and that potatoes are sliced equally thin (my students do this with a mandoline).  My recipe also includes some garlic, which we crush and sautee with the onions in a separate pan just to make things easier (and to give another student a job to do).  The potatoes should NOT be stireed, as they tend to break up and release more starch this way.  One at a time (employ the assistance of another pair of hands to speed this up if you're not cooking alone) is the best way to go.  Keep in mind, you want evenly tender, cooked potatoes.  No browning.  These aren't french fries!  I'm not sure 1 cup of oil is enough.  We don't usually measure, just fill a skillet almost 1\/2 full with olive oil, heat, and then put in potatoes as long as they are all covered , so you don't have to stir.  One reviewer mentioned needing a lot of salt.  I had this problem the first time I made it in class as well.  I had skipped a step in my recipe, which recommends salting the potatoes before cooking, along with seasoning the egg with a little salt and pepper.  This really helps a lot, as salting afterwards just doesn't seem to do it.  The salt doesn't penetrate, and you end up with a really salty outside & lack of flavor inside.  If done correctly, the tortilla should only be flipped once.  High heat when you first drop the egg mixture into the pan is important, as in the original recipe.  This helps to avoid sticking.  However, I don't know that I'd go all the way to the smoking point.  Do reduce the heat and allow to cook slowly right after putting the eggs and potatoes into the pan.  Frequent shaking really isn't necessary.  Just run a rubber scraper around the edge and give it a good shake to loosen before you do the famous \"flip.\"  When the outside edges start to look dry and only the middle looks slightly runny, it's about time to flip.  I'm generally not a big fan of browned eggs, but in this dish, it's necessary and normal for the outside to brown, and no, it doesn't taste like an overcooked dry omlette.  This is totally different!  Yes, you can do the flip!  The first time I did it was in front of 20 teenagers, and I managed it!  The method in the recipe works well, but as you slide back into the pan, have a rubber scraper ready to tuck any potatoes that try to escape back into the eggs.  In Spain, this is served cut into wedges, either hot or cold, and yes, often in sandwiches.  I had never had leftovers to sample cold until this past semester, and WOW, is that good!  The most amazing part of this dish is that I always have students who don't like one or more of the ingredients, but somehow, the combination of all of them ends up creating something that appeals to nearly everyone.  I've only come across one high school student who did not like the dish, and everyone at least tries it.  (They're teenagers, they can't NOT try it!)  We didn't do anything other than pour excess oil out of the pan in between steps, there was no need to clean the pan.  The oil from frying the potatoes can be poured back into the bottle when cooled and stored in the refrigerator for future frying uses.  It will solidify in the refrigerator, but don't be alarmed.  It's still useable and will return to liquid form at room temperature.  Enjoy your tortilla espanola!  It IS a lot of work, but the flavor is worth the effort!  This is the minimalist, traditional recipe.  Once you master it, have fun with it and add whatever you want.  I won't tell the Spaniards you aren't making it the 'traditional' and 'authentic' way!  :)","I made this tortilla today for the lab I work for and everybody liked it. I added 2 crushed garlics to the onions and potatoes to give it a little extra flavor. I also used a 10 inch pan with vertical walls so it could have better volume and shape. Therefore, I used 6 jumbo eggs instead of 4. I spent one semester in spain and this definitely is the real thing or really close to it. But as always every taste is different and you are allowed to change ingredients, times and utensils to be as creative as you can become. Thanks a lot kenk!","A NY Times Featured Chef said this was his favorite food, I am makinkg it for the fifth time...Saturday Night Supper and a Sunday morning breakfast.  It has become favorite of ours too. Thank all the reviewers with their helpful hints. The hardest part is peeling the potatoes.  Thank you \"kenk\" for posting this recipe","This is one of my favorite foods.  Kenk's is a very traditional recipe and not unlike mine.  However, I do a few things differently.  I have found that coarsely grating my potatoes helps make the tortillas more stable during and after cooking.  I start my onions cooking while I'm grating the potatoes and I cook them in about 3T of olive oil.  I use almost as much onion as potato but I don't add garlic because it damages the delicate flavor of the tortilla and isn't as good cold.  The egg to potato ratio is very important.  Basically the egg mixture should easily cover the potatoes when you mix them together.  After you stir the potatoes into the eggs be sure to let them sit for 5 minutes before you pour them into the hot pan to form tortillas.  I use an 8\" omlet pan and usually cook two tortillas.  This pan makes the sliding \/ flipping process much easier and lets you peek under the edge for doneness.  I actually don't flip my tortillas.  I kept trying but had some incredibly horrible failures.  My method is to slide the tortilla onto a large plate and then invert the pan over it and flip the plate and pan quickly.  During the cooking process (before the slide) I take the pan off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes several time.  This helps the runny center set up.  Just be sure that it is hot and sliding around in the pan before you attempt the slide or flip.  You also want to be careful not to overcook because the finished tortilla is best with a creamy texture.  I frequently stray from the traditional by adding a small amount of grated cheddar to the mix (gives a beautiful golden quality to the crust) and sprinkling some on the finished tortilla.  I used to add red and yellow peppers but it too can overpower the simple but delicious flavor of the tortilla.  My husband cares less about tradition and likes crumbled bacon added to the mix.  I usually give in.  Last thing...practice makes perfect when it comes to tortillas so if your first few tries are less than stellar, don't give up!","Delicious for DH, DD (toddler) & I as per my slight modifications. I used two medium small potatoes and 6 eggs but next time would use only 5. I cooked the potatoes in 1\/2 inch of extra virgin olive oil (I do suggest regular olive oil like another reviewer because mine smoked too much). I did not let the potatoes brown much at all. I then added the onion in a lesser amount. I covered the pan to slightly steam the potatoes and onions in order not to brown them and to cook them faster. When they were just about cooked I added sea salt (which was not coarse) to them which I think is very important or the dish will come out to bland. I kept these for a few hours in the refridgerator until morning (suhoor) so it would be much faster to finish. This worked well. I finished the recipe as per instructions also giving a little bit of salt to the eggs. I will definitely make this again.","I have this recipe from Rachel Ray , I think she called it Spanish Pizza. I cubed the potatoes.","This omelette fell apart and I actually had to use 8 eggs so...","Pretty simple.

I would recommend though that you try and add other citrus fruit on top. I used tangello and pomello. Nice!","Yum! Was this ever good. It matched a flavour of Thai Chicken salad that I had years ago and have been searching for since. It is such a tastey, tangy dressing, I love it! I made a bottle of the dressing only and use it on other salads.

(We used canned mandarin oranges to save time.) I think the \"red onion\" should be a \"small red onion,\" unless you're really crazy for red onion! This salad is an an delicious way to enjoy your green leafy vegetables.  If you don't mind the fat, some chow mein noodles would be an excellent topping and add some needed crunch.","This was wonderful!  I doubled the recipe leaving the cilantro and red onion as per the original recipe.  In the freezer section of our grocer (Loblaws) I buy frozen fresh crushed ginger and garlic, they look like mini ice cube trays - love them!  I grilled the breasts seasoning them only with a little garlic salt.  I also used canned (drained) madarin oranges and subbed julienned carrots for the sprouts.  The flavour of the chicken after the quick fry with the dressing is fabulous!!! TRY IT!","I consider myself a bit of a salad fanatic, and this is one of my favs! GREAT summer-fresh type salad and I couldn't help but use the leftover dressing over steamed veggies the next night too.  I used reduced sugar OJ and would do it again.

I used coleslaw mix, Mandarin oranges and left over roast chicken, even with those changes it is a great salad.  Light and nice for a warm summer afternoon.","I used the dressing to pour in my cabbage and carrot salad.  It was delicious!","Super yummy! Although the dressing never thickened up & it was pretty runny. The chicken I used soaked up most of it, but if chicken wasn't used, the salad would have been a bit wet. the flavors were great.

I decided to wilt my bok choy a bit in the same pan I did the chicken in, and tossed it with the dressing in that pan. I also used bamboo shoots and some baby corn.

A great way to eat squash.","I thought this was great, but made a few minor changes. I used olive oil instead of butter (healthier) and sharp cheddar instead of muenster cheese. Next time I make it (there will be a next time!) I would scoop out some of the softened squash and mix it with the filling prior to topping with cheese. It was a nice mix of flavors, and the splash of soy sauce gave it more of a depth of flavor. ","This was my first time making acorn squash, and was looking for a non-sweet, vegetarian recipe. This was the one I went with. The results were oh-so-good! Although next time I will follow the recipe more closely, I did have to make a few small changes because in each case I didn't have fresh on-hand: I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I soaked and finely chopped, frozen broccoli, and dried basil (I also added some dried parsley). I didn't have walnuts so I had to omit those. I'm a vegan, so instead of using muenster, I used a vegan cheddar cheese that is made by Follow Your Heart, and instead of butter, I used a vegan margerine. The results were still amazing. I will make this again, next time with all-fresh ingredients. ","This was really tasty.  The melted muenster cheese really topped it off well.

Thank you!","This was a tasty recipe and I will make it again. However, the recipe as written is a little strange.  It combines sweet (like sweet potatoes), Oriental and a stuffing-like taste. I do not believe the combination works at all.  It would work better to pick one of the styles, instead of combining tastes that don't work well together. \r\n\r\nStuffing Style: remove the brown sugar and soy sauce, add some soft breadcrumbs, double the basil.\r\n\r\nOriental Style: substitute almonds for walnuts, remove brown sugar and basil.\r\n\r\nSweet Style: remove soy sauce and basil. Increase the brown sugar.","I made this almost as the recipe called for. I only had cheddar and pecans on hand and so used those as a sub. If serving as a vegetarian meal, walnuts are the way to go as walnuts are an essential part of a vegetarians diet. My picky meatloving boyfriend LOVED this!","I've made this twice in the past 3 days! After reading the other reviews, I considered changing it up before giving it a try... (I agree, basil and soy sauce and brown sugar sounded like an odd combination to me too) But I am sooo glad I didn't! This combination is perfect in my opinion!! I'm really astonished at how good it tastes!  I only had swiss so that's what I used... still good.  The second time I made it, I didn't have anymore mushrooms so I subbed some shredded zucchini, and had run out of walnuts as well. It was just as good though! I recommend mixing the shredded cheese in a little not just topping it, only thing I do differently!","Delicious and easy!  I made this for myself as a quick weeknight dinner.  I ate one half of the squash and DH took the other half to work for lunch the next day.  He reported back (quite surprised) that he really enjoyed it and asked me if I had used one of my faux sausages as the savory filling.  I explained it was a mushroom\/broccoli\/walnut stuffing that tasted so good.  The only modification I made was to use about half of the brown sugar called for, as I am wary of things being too sweet.  This seemed to be perfect for us.  I will definitely be making this again during the Fall months.  Thanks for a keeper!","This was great!  (I hate to be one of *those* people but I did have to make a couple of changes since I had to use what was on-hand.)  I didn&#039;t have broccoli so I substituted about 1-1\/2 cups of swiss chard, and let me tell you, that was an EXCELLENT choice!  I might actually do this every time.  I also had to use pecans instead of walnuts (no big deal) and I used a combination of ricotta and mozzarella instead of muenster cheese.  The cheeses were a BIG success as well.  I feel like my substitutions didn&#039;t change the recipe too much, so I feel confident in giving this a 5-star rating.

Instead of boiling the potatoes, I fried them. It was faster this way. They ended up tasting cheesy. I would have never imagines they would taste this good. The reason I'm only giving it a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 is because they were very greasy.","Thanks for easy and good recipe!  I used the recommended lemon juice to thin out the mayo.

Once again DA!!! kenk, thanks for the recipe!","I'm sure mine didn't turn out the way intended, as I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces (since I don't like large bites of potato). Then, on top of doing that, I left them in the water after boiling, until I was ready for them, (I knew all along what the result might be, based on the things I was doing lol). I considered posting my result on here as a new recipe, but realized that really, it's still the same recipe, with a slight variation, so others can choose which way they're in the mood for, each time they make it. What happened was that as I was mixing everything together, yes, go figure, the potatoes started falling apart. So, I ended up with something between mashed potatoes & potato salad, only far more garlicky, but very good. Oh, & I did add a tad of dried dill, sweet basil & white pepper. My son had wanted hamburgers, but I didn't want to serve the typical chips, or fries or macaroni & cheese with them, so when I found this recipe I thought it would be a nice fit, a little less plain. I also served it with my Caribbean Coleslaw recipe (#290325) which was nice & light which helped balance out the garlic flavor. For desert I served my Rocky Road Chocolate Mousse (#286486) which was nice, because it was cool & light, & we could each choose how much we wanted, I only had a little because by that time I was very full (duh).  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe that was simple and apparently infallible lol!","MMMMM we loved this recipe!","Yummy....this was absolutely wonderful.  Prepared like FoodExplorer. as I have a heavy hand with potatoes, and didn't want them to mush up.   However, I did not bake them in the oven.  I microwaved them a few minutes to precook a tad before I sliced them.  The sauce was brilliant.  Thnx for posting kenk.","Really wonderful side dish.  Went together fast.

The owner's secret was to use a bay leaf in the potatoes while you are boiling them.  It adds just a little background flavor.","I love garlic, so I added another clove. Garlic lovers unite!","Tastes good, but nothing much to rave about. Pretty easy recipe. Also, I have tried this with both parsley and cilantro, and I think the cilantro gives it a better taste.","Delicious!

I used Granny Smith and Braeburn apples, cut the butter back to around 4 tablespoons and used a bit more flour, brown sugar, and oatmeal  than the recipe called for. This was great and lasted a week in our fridge just fine.","Super Delicious! I used granny smith apples (11), and found that the entire recipe needed to be doubled for a 9 x 13 pan.

If you'd like to have a little more zing to your squash puffs - substitute fish fry instead of the cornmeal...this gives it a little more seasoning with some spice to it.","My 6 year old loved them. I made a few changes because I didn't have cornmeal in the house. I used whole wheat bread crumbs and for the onion I used 2 Tablespoons of parmasan cheese. Thanks for a great kid friendly recipe.","This sounds really GOOD!!!  Thank you, I need all the recipes for yellow squash I can get... can't wait to make it!","This was delicious. It reminded me of hushpuppies.

This is a keeper!! Thanks for posting a neat way to use squash. ","My boys looked at these and said \"is there squash in here?\"....ooohhh they are getting better about finding those hidden vegetables.  BUT they loved them and I had no leftovers....Thanks for a great recipe!","I tried this recipe over the weekend. I thought I had some cornmeal but when I opened the bag, I wasn't sure if it was still good. So since I already had the recipe started I just added some extra flour.  Needless to say, the puffs were pretty doughy on the inside. Maybe it would be better with the cornmeal. I may try again another time.","I would probably call these fritters more than puffs, but they were delicious no matter what you call them! I loved them on their own, but I also tried this mixture as a batter for deep-fried zucchini and it is great for that, too. The main key there is not to put too much batter on the zucchini because the corn flavor can kind of overpower the zucchini. ","Looking for ways to use up all my summer squash, i tried these..oh my, sooo good !!!i couldnt stop eating them. I served them with a curry dipping sauce. They would make fantastic appetizers with a little green salad. I will be making these all summer long. thanks for a great recipe.","We have made these a bunch of times and love them! Great way to get kids to eat veggies!! I've added cheese before and it was great!! Thanks for the recipe! One of our family favorites.","These were very good as the recipe stands.  We made two batches.  In the second batch we cut the cornmeal with breadcrumbs which lightened it up some and added southwestern ingredients like finely chopped jalapeno and green onion, garlic powder, cayene pepper, paprika and cumin.  We just put enough dough for one or two in separate bowl and everyone added what they thought would be good.  We also had various dipping sauces available.  The southwestern flavors dipped in ranch won the day. Thanks riffraff for a good recipe using up some of the garden squash as well as a couple of hours entertainment for the family.","these were great. i used Jiffy cornbread mix,prepared as on the box, lots of onion powder, some cayenne, and a lil hot salsa that was left in the fridge. the squash gave this a nice texture, and a way to get my b\/f to eat the squash. i ate them with a lil maple syrup, n he dipped his in a bit of ketchup. this one's a keeper!","Awesome recipe!  I did alter it a bit and used about 3 onions and then served them with sour cream and hot sauce.  That combination really brings out the flavor.","These were wonderful!  Super easy to make!!  My 5 & 7 year old even ate them.  We added a little Iowa sweet corn.  Yum!!!!","Just made these and they remind me of potato latkes or pancakes.  They were quite tasty, but I really try to avoid frying, and that is the only criticism I have.  I wonder if spraying a broiler pan with Pam and putting them in the oven would work?  Maybe I'll try that the next time I want to make these when I have an extra supply of squash.  A friend dropped off a box (maybe 100 small squash)and I chose a bunch of Zaar yellow squash recipes that appealed to me.  The only problem is that I still have half a box left!  I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.  I just chopped the onion roughly, and the machine did the rest.  It makes one life a lot easier.  Thank you riffraff for the tasty and savory recipe.","These taste very good, and are a nice way to use up the yellow squash abundance from summer gardens.  They don't taste like squash, which would be appealing for those who don't care for yellow squash.  I agree that they could work nicely as a substitute for hush puppies.","These were very good.  Good for using up squash.  Thanks for posting.","first off, i replaced cornmeal w\/ cornflour, so maybe this is why i had creamy centers...but, it just didnt work for me. Hardly any flavor. :(","Thanks for posting this very yummy recipe.  I added 2 teaspoons of sugar because I like sweet cornbread and I grated a clove of garlic to even out the onion...It was just great!  Thanks again!","I followed the original recipe, but added a grated garlic clove, after reading the reviews.  I enjoyed the moist texture but will add sweet corn kernels to give it more of a hushpuppie-like\" taste.  I will also do a teaspoon size dollop, should cook through more evenly, I think.  A great way to use the plethera of yellow squash I have in my freezer from this summers garden!","Delicious! I did take the suggestion of another poster and added some sweet kernel corn. I think that next time, in order to cut back on the fat, I'll add a little oil to the batter and try to bake these.","These are a family favorite!  I also add some cayenne pepper when certain ones will not be eating this... I enjoy the little bounce of flavor... also, use white cornmeal as the meal will not color the yellow squash.  You should try these with a little hand grated cheddar added to the batter... Yummy!","Fantastic!  I made these to use up some yellow squash and zucchini.  I made quantity for 6 servings, added a whole can of corn, and a tablespoon of sugar.  Served alongside baked fish sticks.","The first bite of these I didn't like, the second was better, and soon I was quite addicted to them.  It was a great way to use up some extra squash!  Thanks!","We really liked these. I made them with blanched squash from the freezer and they turned out delicious. We like them dipped in homemade ketchup. ummm good","Yum.  Make plenty.","My family loved these things... !  I made them even more delish by using lard. Yes, that four letter word. Try it and I promise the final result will not seem so greasy or heavy after you've eaten a dozen!  This recipe should definitely be doubled in order to make a decent amount. I used about 4 medium sized squash to do it and then food processed the squash to make it nice and mashed. Also food processed the onions.","Tasty little things, but mine were more flat like a pancake or latke. Not sure why they lost their shape. I used an electric skillet and thought it worked pretty slick.","These are delicious!  I made them as written but plan on try some of the suggestions of the other reviewers, especially adding southwestern flavors and sweet corn to the batter.  This was an excellent recipe to help me use up the bumper crop of yellow squash coming out of my garden.  Thanks Riffraff :)<br\/>***8\/26\/11****Adding stars and also want to comment that these reheat really well, SO, since we're getting so sick and tired of squash (been eating it for 3 weeks now), I'm going to make a huge batch of these and freeze them to eat during the winter, I'm sure we'll love squash again in January!!","Yellow squash are my favorite squash.  I would simplify it by using self-rising flour.  I would also fry the puffs in Ghee, for extra flavor.  By the way, thanks for the new word \"offal\" to be added to my vocabulary, pronounces the same as awful.","These are really tasty! I think we'll try adding hot sauce next time we make them.","Really enjoyed this.  I added a little less onion and then put in onion powder instead, just simply because I wanted my children to eat them.  I also put the smashed squash into a stainer and shook out excess water.","These puffed up nice. I modified the recipe slightly for my picky eater.

You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle.

I thought about throwing out the juice but wanted its flavor.  I originally cut this while still hot and was a little disappointed, but once it cooled and set all its flavor came out.  Good taste and not too sweet.  Very enjoyable.","My husband's favorite pie. You can cut back the sugar a bit, and I used whole wheat flour and forgot the margarine--still turned out FABULOUS.","I made this as a special treat for my husband recently.  I used frozen blueberries and added the cornstarch as recommended by others.  I omitted the nutmeg, too.  I sprinkled turbinado sugar on top for an added touch.  One important note:  This pie baked at 325 for about an hour in my oven.   I covered the edge of the pie crust with foil so it wouldn't get too brown.","this is one marvelous blueberry pie. Made it for my family and my mom and dad for dessert tonight. My dad did something I've never seen him do, he licked his bowl! It will probably be a frequently requested pie from here on out. Thanks for such a great recipe.","Absolutely fabulous! No words can describe.","Insanely good.","I forgot to add the margarine. I didn't have lemon zest.\n\nI did add extra blueberries (about a cup because I just didn't want them to go to waste) and I did add a tablespoon of cornstarch (because others had suggested it). \n\nIt was delicious!!!! I love the bit of nutmeg and cinnamon taste that makes this unlike an \"ordinary\" blueberry pie. \n\nThanks for sharing this recipe.","I had picked about a gallon of fresh blueberries and was looking for a new recipe to use them in.  WOW!  This was the best blueberry pie my husband and I have ever had!  I'm going to make the same pie again this afternoon, thanks so much!","This pie was amazing!!\r\ni never used nutmeg in blueberry pie before but this time i used freshly ground nutmeg and i think this was the key ingredient and made the pie so special.\r\nThank you for sharing","My first blueberry pie, I used 5 cups of fresh strawberries.\n\nThis was delicious and easy to make, thanks for sharing.\n\nI should note that I used Tenderflake frozen pie crusts.","This was terrific!\nI used frozen blueberries.\nI forgot to add the margarine but it didn't matter.\nThis will be my staple fruit pie recipe from now on.","I used fresh blueberries and added flour to coat them, so they wouldn't be runny when the pie was done.  Works like a charm every time.  This pie was delicious, and is a new favorite!  We had it heated with some Vanilla ice cream, and it was excellent!  I used refrigerated pie dough instead of making my own, as I was in a time crunch. I will make with my own next time.  This is now going to be my \"go to\" blueberry pie recipe.","Taste is fabulous.  I used frozen berries, so added cornstarch to the mixture.  Baked up plump and pleasant! YUM!","This was wonderful even though I didn't have any lemon zest and I had to use 2 cups of frozen blueberries since I only had 2 cups of fresh ones.  I also made it with a chocolate crust using crushed chocolate animal cookies and oil.  It was the perfect sweetness and had a very potent blueberry flavor.","A very flavorful blueberry pie!  I too added cardamon...just enhanced the flavor even more.  I will use this recipe again.  Thank you.","Replace flour with 2 tablespoons of instant tapioca and one tablespoon corn starch (cream). On low heat place half of blueberries and stir in ingredients. Stir untill dissolved. pour in pie shell and add remaining 2 + cups blueberries.\r\nReplace margirine with Butter.","At the end of the summer season last year, I found an amazing deal on blueberries.  I made the pie filling then, and popped it in my freezer.  Fast forward seven months, and I took the pie filling out of the freezer, defrosted it, plopped it into a Pillsbury pie crust (frozen since Christmas), and voila! We had a scrumptious blueberry pie for Easter dinner!  This was very good.  Not too sweet, but sweet enough!  I'll definately make this again!!","This was like eating a slice of summer!!! I used fresh berries, & freshly squeezed lemon juice since I was already needing a lemon for the zest. Wow. SO FRESH! It was great! I did the lattice-crust top, and it was amazing. My hubby was in blueberry hog heaven! Plus I love how easy it was - no pre-cooking of the berries! this is SO DEFINITELY a keeper. Thanks!!!","One of the better blueberry pies I've eaten.  Every ingredient was spot-on!  Let the blueberries stand in the lemon juice for about fifteen minutes before adding the other ingredients.  I think they really liked their lemon bath!  Thnx for posting this recipe, Nancy.  Made for Comfort Cafe Summer 2009.","I've never made a blueberry pie before (not sure why) but boy am I glad I tried this one !  I made it for a dinner party and EVERYONE raved about it and requested the recipe.  The only changes I made was adding 1\/2 T. cornstarch and an extra cup of berries. Because they were fresh and super sweet I didn't alter any other ingredients. This one is a real keeper !  My only regret was that there weren't any leftovers for a late night snack :o)","Made this a week or so ago!  Great pie recipe.  I don't usually make pies, especially fruit pies that usually have to be cooked, but I was visiting a friend whose husband wanted blueberry pie and we used this recipe.  It's delicious!\n\nI didn't make any changes to the recipe. \n\nNext time I might use a bit less sugar.\n\nThank you!","It was absolutely amazing. I made it the other night with my boyfriend and its already gone. It has soo many flavors in it and every spoonful was heaven. The only change i made was sub the 3\/4 cup of sugar to 1\/2 cup of brown sugar. The brown sugar brings out all of the other ingredients.","Well this was a easy recipe to do. I used orange instead of lemon since I prefer it and it was a great taste, espically with the cinnamon. I used frozen blueberries with 1 tbsp added cornstarch which worked out fine, the major problem was that the flour mix never encorporated into the pie. It just got gooey. So I'm not sure I would use the full amount again, maybe only 1\/2.","Best blueberry pie I ever made or tasted.  The only change I made was to use Splenda instead of sugar (due to a diabetic in the family), and I swear on my mother's grave that you couldn't tell the difference.  After you make this pie be sure to have a good hiding place for it!  It's that good!","Absolutely amazing. Didn't change anything. I make it for every gathering now and it usually doesn't last more than 10 minutes!","Went to the orchard today and picked lots of blueberries, so decided a blueberry pie would be perfect.  This recipe is awesome - couldn't wait for the pie to completely cool to have a slice!  Now can't wait to have a slice once it has set - the combo of flavors with those fresh blueberries is amazing.  I also threw in about a cup of chopped strawberries that I had in the fridge - did I mention it is yummy? :) Will definitely be making this again!","Awesome recipe with great flavor.  Hubby loved it!!!!","I've been making this pie for a couple of years.  It's become my \"go to\" blueberry pie recipe.  The spices gives this pie more depth of flavor than most blueberry pies.  And, of course, it's easy as pie to make.  Goes good with a generous dollop of Greek yogurt.","This was the first blueberry pie I have made, and it was absolutely delicious.  It was a bit runny, so I may try adding cornstarch next time, as another reviewer suggested.  I will definitely make this again!","So tasty and so easy! My daughter wanted to make a pie with the fresh blueberries and this looked easy enough for a nine year old. We used frozen pie crusts which was even quicker. It was simple and fun to make. And the taste is amazing! Definitely will use this recipe again!","Best blueberry pie I have ever had. Ever.","This pie is amazing. My husband requested blueberry pie for Father's Day. He normally doesn't like desserts, but absolutely loved this pie. The only change I made was to add some cornstarch (even though I used fresh berries).

Thanks for a great receipe!","With a huge rhubarb crop this year, I'm trying lots of new recipes.  This one is a real winner!

DH was jealous that I brought them all into work, so I promised to make him a batch and will soon!","I loved this recipe. I used an egg replacer instead of an egg and it turned out great.

Very moist.  I let the rhubarb set with 1\/2 c sugar for 15 minutes to give the fruit and sugar time to develop some juice.  I then lessened the sugars to another 1\/4 c white sugar and only 1\/2 c brown sugar.  Instead of shortening (only cause I didn't have any) I used margarine.  Followed the rest of the recipe. The batter seemed dry and sticky and hard to spread when I put it in the pan but it came out perfect and moist.  It was done in 40 minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe.","More like a cake.Not as moist as I would of liked..","Very good...I also used butter instead of shortening and it was very moist.  I also allowed the rhubarb to sit in the sugar for a good 20 minutes to release the liquid.  It's a nice cross between a cake and a cookie bar.  We all agreed that the addition of walnuts or pecans would be really nice too...","Only a meh for me, because they don't have a lot of rhubarb flavor, but my husband who doesn't like rhubarb that much thought they were good (surprise) and many of the folks I fed them to liked them. As the other reviewers said, these are basically blondies, and would be much improved with some nuts.","Everyone in our house loves these! <br\/>Two pans gone over the weekend.<br\/>Thanks for sharing!","I made these for a potluck tomorrow and they turned out wonderfully! I love rhubarb so I would have liked more rhubarb flavor out of them but to serve to others (most of whom probably aren't as big fans of rhubarb as I am) I think this is a wonderful combination of sweet and (just a bit) tart. They are somewhere between a cake and a bar and I think next time I make them, I may use more rhubarb in hopes of getting more 'juice' and making them more solid and bar-like. Either way, these are delicious and a wonderful way to enjoy my rhubarb!","Good taste, but needed significantly more rhubarb to balance out the other filling.  I put about 2-1\/2 cups and I would put at least 4 cups in next time.  The surrounding batter was definitely sweet enough to handle it - I'm really surprised at folks who described this recipe as \"not sweet\"... I also used butter instead of shortening.","Here in the UK we have a lot of rhubarb - must be the climate! We were very happy to try this recipe. Lovely and crunchy outside, soft and moist inside. I cut back on the sugar almost instinctively - and it was perfect. Dave said it was worth the wait and is heading off for second helpings!

It reminds me of the Dal I used to have at my best friend's place during my school days. The only possible change I'd make is to increase the amount of red peppers for a little more 'heat'. Also, you can omit the rice, and drink this as a wonderful lentil soup. It's great for when you have a really bad cold, and need something to warm you up. Thanks for sharing this one... I'm sooo gonna make it over and over!","This dish was incredibly tasty and easy to make as well! I substituted broccoli for the cauliflower (that's the only thing I had on hand) and added a bit more red pepper because I like my dal spicy. Altogether a great recipe . . . all my roommates loved the smell and the taste!","I made this recipe for some guests who had spent time in India.  They couldn't beleive how great it was!  I modified by cooking in pressure cooker for about 10 minutes at high pressure.  I allowed the guests to add more heat by having Thai spicy sauce on the side.  A DEFINITE WINNER!","enjoyed this very much, I usually puree my dal, but this is much nicer.  Thank you","This makes a very attractive dish.  I made it pretty much as the recipe called for.  If I were change anything, I might add additional red pepper flakes.  Other than that this was very good.","This recipe is simply delicious. I subbed peanut oil for olive oil, added 25% more ginger and red pepper, subbed yellow zucchini for cauliflower, and added 25% less lime juice. Right amount of Tumeric, the sauce is excellent, the basmati rice and lentils are filling - would make again in a second.","Tastes great. Nice and spicy, just the way I like my food. I easily doubled this recipe and had leftovers for a few days to take to work. I also liked the fact that it's such an easy recipe to make. Very quick to put together. ","I used this recipe for a homeschooling geography fair presentation on India. It was a big hit. I doubled the recipe, and went home with an empty crockpot. I got many requests for the recipe. Even the kids loved it. I forgot to add the cilantro and it was still great. Thanks so much Strawberry Girl!","Excellent.  I loved the flavor, and the taste.  I omitted the cauliflower and added extra tomatoes - perfect!  Thank you!","Really good! Though I might prefer a bit more lentils and less cauliflower florets. But anyways... the taste is great!","Lovely flavours,I,ll be having this again.\r\nJust serve with rice or Naan, it was delicious","Very easy to make and it tasted great!!! I omitted the cauliflower(not a fan) and didn't have tumeric but it was still very flavorful. My husband and I had it with some tandoori pork chops and rice.","This is a family favourite in our house. I originally got it from Cooking Light but was happy to find it here on 'Zaar. I usually use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and double the ginger. I serve with basmati rice, a big dollop of plain yoghurt, and microwaved pappadums. I sometimes partially puree this. I usually use red lentils, but see in the pictures some people have used brown. Might try that for something different!","I just made this for dinner, it was so easy and fast, I didn't add Cauliflower (didn't have any)and added ground coriander (didn't have fresh. I added a little more salt, to my taste. It only took about 15 min of cooking which was great. I love the colour, texture and taste. Next time I might experiment with adding other spices like garramasala and curry powder for added idian flavours. I love it thank you so much.","The lime taste was very strong. I added garam marsala, diced green chilis, a cup more lentils, more salt, black pepper, Louisiana Hot Sauce, a can of stewed tomatoes, and extra diced tomatoes, and served it over jasmine rice.","Garam Masala was essential. It was lacking something without it, I also used fresh jalepenos. I served coriander chutney available on the side as well and I made home made naan to go with it. I also used yellow split peas instead of lentils a little less lime juice and after everything was suatee'd I threw it in the crock pot.","Great dal.  I needed a basic dal (I took out the cauliflower) for my rice with a veg dish and this was just perfect.","This was pretty good, I have been searching for a good dhal recipe. I liked the added cauliflower & tomato. My husband thinks a little spinach at the end would be nice as well. It made a huge pot which we ate for lunch the next day and still leftovers!","It turned out good, I forgot the ginger and it would have been better had I added it.  I also pureed it when it was done and mixed the rice into the puree...it tasted great.","I've never had Lentil Dal before. It was fairly bland to me, from my experience with curry type dishes. I do love the idea that it is a healthy vegetarian dish.  I would make it again for myself since I love to eat healthy, but I would never make it for company or a hot date.","very nice!\r\nused vegetable stock instead of water and added chopped carrot and peas to up the veggy quota. Oh and grind the cumin seeds(or use pre ground) as it gets a fuller flavour then but otherwise YUMMY! my kids loved it, as did I. \r\nI can imagine it would be a touch boring if made exact to recipe but adding stock and ground cumin gave it a lovely rich flavour. make a double batch!!!","I was a bit doubtful that all the rave reviews could be right - but they were!  A very, very nice dal.  I used puy lentils so the cooking time more than doubled and the cauliflower was overcooked.  I hardly ever follow recipes exactly but with this one I did and personally wouldn't change a thing.  Really yummy with brown rice.","I made this as written except for using ground cumin and some extra cilantro (can't help myself), and this was really excellent. It's so healthy, too! I know I'm really slow cutting up veggies, but the prep time definitely took me more than 5 minutes, but it was still more than worth it for the final results. So flavorful and hearty and one that I will make again! Thank you for sharing this great recipe.","Incredible recipe!  It only tasted better after sitting for a bit.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this one!","I loved this recipe, I will make it again, I found that I needed more salt, I use Celtic Salt, and more lime. I also increased the red pepper to taste. I really like this dish for those members in my family who want to eat exciting different dish but are afraid of curry and spice.","I really like this receipe.  For a quick lunch, I omitted the cauliflower and tomatoes, went very well with my brown rice. Thank you.","LOVED THIS RECIPE! The first time I made this, I thought it was a little bland. Last night, I made it again but used beef stock instead of water and added 1 tsp of garam masala.  It ended up better than I'd get at a restaurant!","The first time I made this, it was a little bland. This time I added cranberries (halfway through cooking) and more crushed red pepper... maybe not as authentic, but the cranberries really added depth! It was great, and went over well with my critic. =)","This was a good standard. I felt like it was missing something...I can't put my finger on it. I followed another reviewers advice and added a sprinkling of garam masala, but I guess I didn't add enough. Made a nice healthy meal complemented by Recipe #21855","all i could taste was lime :(","it was ok.","Pretty bland, but that may be the fault of six cups of rice. The flavor may have been diluted for having to spread across so much starch. Regardless, if I make this again, I will likely tinker with the seasoning quantities and use a LOT less rice.","I loved this.  I threw in a lot of red pepper flakes to give it some kick.  I have little cooking talent, and it still turned out great.","Excellent recipe!  I have made it twice.  The second attempt, I added 2 carrots, doubled the spices and added 1 T cayenne pepper for more 'kick'.","my favorite dal recipe.  the best","The flavor was excellent.  I couldn't get my lentils to cook down (too old?  I bought them the same day as I made the soup!) I will likely try the recipe again with another kind of lentils.  I also added some chopped carrots and celery and some garam marsala.","This was so easy to make and better than going out for a takeaway.  All the family enjoyed","This was my first time making Dhal, although it&#039;s one of my favorite Indian dishes. This recipe is easy to follow with simple ingredients which are easy to find at most grocery stores. I made one change: I used vegetable broth instead of water and I think it helped add to the flavor of the dish. Warning: this dish is mild, as it&#039;s supposed to be. It&#039;s great served with a spicy main (I served it with a very hot chicken tikka masala &amp; some rice). Over-all good but I think I will add more cauliflower next time.","Terrific recipe! I followed other peoples suggestions and used broth instead of water and added a teaspoon of garam Marsala. Excellent!  I made it for a dinner party and had to share the recipe with everyone.  This digs was. A hit!","So good, I made it 7 weeks in a row and never got sick of it. I use ground cumin, frozen cauliflower florets, canned diced tomatoes and add 1 tsp of veggie Better than Bouillon to the water. I also let it cook on med-high for 15-20 minutes and the lentils turn out nice and mushy like at restaurants. I rave about this recipe to everyone I know.","This was amazing!

This was a recipe I will make over and over again.","Haven't made this yet but can see from the ingredients that it will be very good!","Fantastic tasty meal, I made some chipati to accompany it, but used cauliflower rice instead of cauliflower florets, and added a teaspoon of curry powder to taste just before the end."],"vegetarian":"Y","pescetarian":"Y","vegan":"Y","lactose intolerant":"Y","gluten free":"Y","peanut allergy":"Y","kosher":"Y","halal":"Y"},{"id":458,"name":"basic crepes ii","minutes":65,"ingredient_ids":[2499,2683,4717,840,6270],"ingredients":["eggs","flour","milk","butter","salt"],"steps":["combine all ingredients in a blender","whirl one minute","scrape down and blend 15 seconds more","refrigerate at least one hour before making crepes","heat a lightly greased 6 inch skillet","remove from heat","spoon in 2 tbsp batter","lift and tilt skillet to spread evenly","return to heat","brown on one side only","to remove , invert pan over paper toweling","repeat with remaining batter"],"description":"yum","calorie_level":0,"avg_rating":5.0,"review":["Excellent crepe recipe!

Cold, refreshing and incredibly frothy. The honey flavor came through but wasn't overpoweringly sweet.

The blend of tarragon, thyme and rosemary in the breading is sublime; it's the first time I've ever liked anything with tarragon, possibly because we used fresh not dried.  We substituted about half the oil in the vinaigrette with white wine instead, and I thought it tasted a bit like commercial salad dressing; no idea if that's due to the substitution.  I thought it might have been brighter if it used fresh-squeezed lemon juice instead of rice wine vinegar.  The horseradish in the breading practically disappears, but that's a hazard of cooking horseradish; it's always strongest uncooked.  Our big change was that we left our 1.3 lb salmon fillet whole w\/ skin on the back, seared both sides, but only breaded the skinless side.  We baked 20 min, and it was still cold raw in the middle.  So then we cut into smaller fillets and broiled about 7 minutes and it was finally done just right.

Thanks Malarkey Test....","I used a 1 lb. frozen organic hash brown mix from my freezer and halved the rest of the ingredients.  I chose this recipe because I had everything available on my kitchen shelf and was low fat to boot.  I allowed my hashed browns to defrost quite a bit before cooking, used a small casserole dish, substituted cayenne pepper powder for red pepper, and cooked for recommended length of time.

Eating them was effortless too.  The temp-time was perfect for a convection oven.  Thanks, Malarkey.","I was looking to make fresh hash browns this weekend and came upon this recipe. I made it exactly as stated and it turned out just as I'd hoped. I couldn't taste much spicyness, just a hint, which was good. I ended up with some leftovers which were quickly reheated in a skillet the next day and tasted just as good.

Thanks for posting!","Fantastic!  Just what I was looking for this morning.  I halved the recipe and I diced the potatoes fairly small and baked them for 45 minutes.  Next time I'll make them a little bigger.  The flavor was just enough to tingle but not overpowering, and I added a couple shakes of garlic powder.  I will definitely make these again and try to freeze them and see how they work.  Wonderful, thanks!!!","These were great! I have never baked hashbrowns before, its nice to be able to toss them in the over without parboiling or monitoring them in a skillet. I pumped up the spices a little and added two onions diced in large chunks.","Delicious hash browns!  I shredded my potatoes but cooked them for the same amount of time.  They came out perfectly, a lovely golden brown.  What a wonderful treat, thanks for posting!","I shredded my potatoes as others indicated, but was very disappointed in the results.

Easy to prepare and no worrying about them!  I think they need a little extra seasoning, but they are a definite \"make again\" recipe in our house!

I always just cut up some red potatoes into chunks and then throw them in the oven. I have doubled this recipe twice and it turns out perfect. I do need to add salt on them though once they come out of the oven. This one's a keeper!","Very tasty! I sprinkled the hash browns with seasoning salt when they came out of the oven, and they were perfect.","Very Tasty! I love how little olive oil you use. I shredded my potatoes in my Kitchenaid and they turned out great. Very easy.","Pretty good, certainly had a kick to them! Yummy though.","We make these almost every weekend- especially with comany.

The only directions I did follow were the baking directions and how to mix all the ingredients together. The ingredients were simple and the hash browns were easy to make. I just reccomend, for those who like their hash browns a little crunchy, pan frying the hash browns in a greased skillet after they have cooked in the oven. Great recipe!!!","This was a great recipe! I just can't make frozen hash browns--they always come out bad!! But my husband loves them, and I was glad to find this recipe to try on him. He enjoyed them, but thought the spice mixture needed just a bit more salt & spice. I used 2 cups diced potatoes, and had already upped the spices but next time will use a bit more! They looked wonderful--crisp on the outside from the oil & had great color. Thanks so much for sharing! I am grateful to add this to his breakfast menu!","For some reason the 5th time I made these they turned out the best.  Up go the stars.","It was a hit in our household. Definitely had a kick. Made it pretty much as per recipe but had to substitute red pepper for cayenne pepper (it may actually be the same thing). Will definitely make again.","I didn't like the taste of the hash browns baked but the seasoning was wonderful, really spicy and flavorful.  I'm going to try this recipe again but will fry the potatoes instead.","Really tasty!  I didn't use the red pepper flakes, instead subbed in about 1\/4 tsp of hot paprika.  this made them mild enough my toddler could eat them.","Good!

You can really taste the apricots and all the flavors are very well-balanced.  I actually made this as a loaf, rather than muffins (by the way, just to note, 6 jumbo muffins should equal 12 regular-sized muffins, so I think that Dorel was mistaken in that respect).  It turned out with a lovely cake-like crumb, dense and moist.  I was surprised that the recipe instructed to add the apricot so early- most baked good recipes call for any fruit added to be added at the very end so that the fruit isn't broken down.  I think the fact that the apricots were added earlier and mashed a little as I mixed in the other ingredients made the bread moister and infused the whole thing with more apricot flavor.  I made a few subs- I used whole wheat pastry flour rather than all-purpose, sucanat rather than white sugar and butter instead of shortening.  I didn't find it at all too sweet, especially with the fresh apricots which are much less sweet than dried.  I really liked the flavor\/texture that the walnuts added.  Just a really lovely bread. I liked it especially refrigerated and sliced thinly- mmm!","These were really good! I was surprised how moist they were.

Favorite topping for this is to serve with chili, grated cheese and onions. The kids love it simply with catsup. \r\nEither way this dish is a MAJOR favorite of our family. Great also for the kids who are learning to cook.","The corn dog casserole tasted a lot like baked cornbread stuffing. I liked it and would eat it again, but it was a no go with the 10 year old. My four year old picked out the hot dogs but left most of the breading on her plate.\r\nAlso, it had to cook longer than indicated here. After 45 minutes it was done, so when you try the recipe, give yourself more time than stated.","This was a huge let down for my family. I think if there was not as much sage, it might be ok. But not one single person in my family liked it. I don,t mean to be negative, but honestly, this dish was awful.","I like to make new dishes for potluck so I tried this recipe.  Everyone thought it was great and thought it was a fun and different kind of casserole.  You need to add Ketchup or BBQ sauce on the finished casserole to bring out the flavors - just like with corn dogs on a stick.","I cut this recipe in half since its just hubbie and me. Took a little longer than listed to bake (more like 35-40 minutes). We both LOVED it...no other acoutriments needed...served with cole slaw.","Great kid pleaser meal!!I added smoked sausage for the hot dogs and it tasted great(I guess that makes it sausage casserole,huh:))I used Marie Callenders cornbread mixture(my favorite),this will be a regular on my table!Thanks for sharing!!!","This was so easy and so good! The celery added a nice flavor and texture to the dish.  Sort of tastes like a corndog without the stick!  Thanks Mysterygirl for posting another winner!","I've made this recipe before and it's super yummy if you like corn dogs!!  Serve with catsup and mustard!!!","It was a good easy recipe.  I learned that my son (3) is not too fond of celery yet. So we will try it again when his tastes change.","Fast and easy dish here to make.  I liked the addition of the sage.  I did not have green onions so used a white one.  Oh man, I just read DDW's review I forgot about using catsup and mustard.  :-(  There is not even a crumb left to try catsup on!  Thanks for a great recipe that takes me right back to the Iowa State Fair and their corn dogs!","The title sounds peculiar but this dish is great! It's definitely going to be a favorite of mine. Because of picky eaters I used half the amount of vegetables and half the amount of sage. I added a pinch of salt and some garlic powder. It was perfect. I also added a lot more cheese on the top than just 1\/2 of a cup. It got toasted golden and crunchy; not ooey gooey; just wonderful. Also note that my dish was ready in 17 minutes, not 30! This would be a super dish to take to a potluck. I can't wait for the opportunity. And lastly, must have mustard to dip! YUM!","great recipe~ i made a smaller amount and left out the celery :) but still a good and easy meal!","This was pretty good, i didnt put celery into it though, i dont eat just hot dogs, dont like em, but i do like corn dogs and these were pretty close!","Great recipe & quick to make.  This was a hit at our house, even with those who do not like hot dogs.  To save extra time, I sauteed the celery and onions together.  This is a keeper recipe!","Very good.  We put the left overs in the frige and snacked on them for a couple of days.  ","I halved the recipe and used a bit more cheese than indicated but I felt that it needed something extra added to add more flavor--maybe sliced tomatoes on top of the casserole.","A recipe must be good if you forget an ingredient and the family still likes it!  I forgot the cheese but hubby and I still enjoyed this very much.  I also used yellow onions instead of green onions.  5 stars for originality!","My kids are corn dog lovers, so this was a huge hit with them.  They made sure I have this recipe saved and printed out so that I can make it again and again.","This tasted pretty good, but it was very crumbly and did not hold together well. I will make it again, but may use an extra egg.","Kid pleaser!! I too enjoyed this. My step-daughter wanted this for her birthday dinner and said that this birthday was better than last year's Chuck E. Cheese birthday because they didn't have hot dogs.","This casserole tasted just like corndogs without the sticks! I would reccomend eating this topped with your favorite corndog condiments. Ketchup and mustard mixed is what topped mine. I thought that it was alittle dry without the toppings. I think next time I'll try some extra onions, celery and cheese in the batter. Still a great tasting casserole for corndog lovers!","This recipe is really good and the sage tastes wonderful in it. It really goes great with the cornbread. I took this to a potluck and everyone loved it. I brought mustard but wasn't really crazy about the taste of the mustard on this. I think that it was very good just by itself. The next time I will also use smoked sausage or little smokies. Thank you, MG.","This recipe was good, served it with ketchup. I too felt it was dry without ketchup. It seemed like maybe it was missing something, but was a very good quick recipe. Would consider making again if I was in a time crunch with few ingredients on hand. ","I liked it a lot. I kept telling the kids \"it's a kid pleaser\", but they still didn't take to it. The two year old ate two servings, however. I had to leave out the onion and celery because the kids don't like busy food. (ok, I snuck in some dried, minced onion- shh). It was a little dry that way, so when I make it again (and I will) I may add more milk or egg.","We didn't think this tasted like 'corn dogs' but it wasn't in anyway a disagreeable flavor!  I'm wondering what I did wrong...Mine didn't look like the picture?\r\nPossibly too much cheese...I think I should try the recipe again!  I served ours with a mustard sauce...(mustard, mayo and crushed red chili flakes combined)","Wow, this was really good!  We cut back on the sage a little and really piled on the cheese - the kids added some mustard at the table and they're already asking when we can have it again.  :)","I slightly messed up the recipe by combining everything together instead of splitting the hot dog mix.  It was really good and my husband loved it.  We used turkey hot dogs, which were great.  One thing I might try next time is using a 2qt dish instead so it is a little thicker.","Was very nice, i made it today and my bf and me liked it very much. I love corndogs but as they usually have to be fried and i try to not do it, when i found this recipe was very glad that was baked instead. I made some variations though, I used polenta meal with baking powder and all-purpouse flour, instead of the cornbread mix. It's already in my favorites and i will make it more, but i guess will use something else like mushrooms instead of celery :).Tnx 4 sharing","Great recipe!!!  I used fresh sage, but other than that followed it exactly.  I will definitely be making it again. (I just had to put ketchup on top and it was a nice touch.)","This is such a good & easy recipe.  I had all the stuff on hand & my husband & I both loved it.  I added a blob of honey to the batter... mmm...  I've already shared this recipe with several corndog-loving friends.  Thanks!!","I didn't have any sage in the house so I didn't put it in and this was still good.  I saw this recipe on another website and some people complained it was a little dry. One of the reviewers said they'd added a can of creamed corn and it made it much more moist.  I might try that next time, but we didn't really have issues with the texture.","Very tasty!! Thank you for posting!","I was concerned about making this because my DH is not a fan of cornbread, but knew our DS's would enjoy it. Didn't need to worry DH gave it a thumbs up! I LOVED the sage in it, made the world of difference.\r\nThank You Nancy Van Ess-","I loved this recipe and it did taste like corn dogs. My husband gave it 5 stars so it's a winner.","this was good, i made it for my 19 month old grand daughter and skipped the green onions and celery and she loved it.","This was really good.  You don't have to be a kid to like this.  I did add garlic, just because I love garlic and use it in everything. The prep time is rather long for a week night if you work, but the taste sure made up for it. Thanks for a casserole that will be made in our house again.","Great recipe! I omitted the celery due to a picky 3 yr old and husband but it was still wonderful and very easy! Thank you for sharing!","It was okay.. my DS liks hot dogs and cornbread, so it was a different treat for him.","Yummy! I used fat free hot dogs, egg beaters, lowfat cheese, left out the butter & just sauted the veggies in chicken broth. You couldn't really taste the cheese -- I might use less or even leave it out. Thanks -- we liked the recipe a lot!","I tried this years ago when I first started getting TOH magazine. It's a really nice comfort food-type dish! ","YUM!  This recipe makes for a lot of good eats!  It baked up nicely and tasted great!  There isn't a thing I'd change about this keeper!  Thanks so much for posting your recipe, it was really good :)","I am just not a big fan of this.  Everything came out just great, and my kids ate this up.  I might try adding a little garlic next time.  ","Sorry, this casserole didn't have enough flavor for me.  My grandson, who loves corn dogs didn't even care for it.","Real good recipe and easy and quick to make. With the sage, it tasted like cornbread stuffing with hot dogs.\r\nI questiond the 2 boxes of Jiffy Mix since mine were only 8 oz each, but it worked out perfectly.","I really didn't care for this recipe, however, my sister and her boyfriend loved it.  It came out very dense, which turned me off.  I also didn't think it had much flavor.  I couldn't even eat the leftovers.  I thought this recipe was a goner, until my sister's boyfriend raved about it, so to each his own!","OK, I loved it!  My DH and kids thought it was \"alright\".  I guess it depends on what you like.  Maybe if I would have added more cheese.  I'll make a smaller recipe for just me next time.  The kids can eat canned soup or something!","This was tasty. I love corn dogs, though. I omitted celery and the sage and used vegetarian hot dogs. Tasted great-just like a corndog.","Although the baked casserole looked great, this recipe did not work for us because 1.) the taste of sage was very overpowering, and 2.) the overall texture was like Stove-Top Cornbread Stuffing with hot dog pieces stirred in. Making a half-batch trial run of the recipe might be a good idea for first-timers.","This was really good! My 6 year old helped me make it. I used egg substitute, kosher fat free hot dogs, light cheddar and light butter substitute to make it healthier. I omitted the sage, green onion and celery because I knew my kids would not like it. We had mustard and ketchup at the table to dip. My son is taking some to school for lunch tomorrow, and he really had fun helping me make it. Thanks for the recipe! :)","I made this in hopes of my picky kid finally liking something...to no avail.  She picked out the hot dogs and left the cornbread, LOL.  Anyway the 14 year old and I thought is was okay at best.  I didn't include the celery or sage because that would have been a guaranteed no from picky pete.  It was quick to put together and nice baking time.","I think the recipe could have called for more hot dogs and more cheese.","This is a great base recipe for kids and family. I was excited when I saw it but new that for my family, green onion and sage would not work. I substituted sweet walla walla onions and added garlic powder and 1 cup frozen corn. HUGE HIT for the family. Thanks for posting!","We didn't care for the overall taste & texture of this dish.  It might have been the strong taste of sage, just not our style.","Very good; I like sage and really enjoyed it in this dish. I do not eat hot dogs however, so I used veggie dogs instead. Turned out wonderfully. Also added one can of corn niblets to the batter. A tasty, healthy (with veggie dogs!) dish. Thank you!","This came out WAY better than expected and I agree with others who say it tastes a lot like a cornbread stuffing! My family devoured it! Can't wait to make it again!","This was really yummy. It taste somewhat like stuffing.  My whole family really enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting this recipe.","I had such high hopes for this recipe but it was awful. No one in my house liked it at all.","I've made this exact recipe except I used double the amount of cheese and I didn't use the sage! This was VERY good! I made it for my kids birthday party and all the kids loved it! I used chicken franks to make it a little healthier! This worked perfectly! I added my photo!","Super easy to make!! Great taste!  My boyfriend loved it so much it was all gone in 2 days!! We however didn't put in any of the vegetables and left out the sage. This is something we will definitely be making again soon!!!","We thought it was good, but it seemed too dry.  I think next time I am going to add some butter to it before hand.","Easy to make, tasty, and best of all - the kids loved it!  Didn't have any celery so just left that out!","Tasted bland, onions may have helped that, but I had to leave them out since my daughter doesn't like them.  She wouldn't eat it anyways.  I couldn't even coax her to pick out and eat the hotdog pieces. I made this for her, I am not a big fan of hotdogs, and I didn't want to eat it, so we threw it in the garbage.","Very Tasty! My son Seth LOVED it!!!! He ate half of it because he loves corn dogs!","In my ongoing search for a meal my visiting DGD would eat tried this one.  She still wouldn't touch it but the rest of us loved it; what a great, easy dinner.  There was not a bite left over.  Such a differant dish with flavors that remind you of those fair corn dogs, but with enough extra to make it a meal.  I baked in an iron skillet mainly for the looks and it turned out great.  I'm sure another less picky eater will enjoy it so planning to make it again when my DGSs come to visit.","I've been wanting to make this for some time because I like corn dogs, but this seems much easier and healthier. I used recipe # 345502 for the Jiffy Mix. I didn't have any green onions, so I used chopped red onion. I also added chili powder, garlic powder, and a diced jalepeno. <br\/>It was pretty yummy and my 2 year old also approved!<br\/>Thanks!","Yummy!  Actually this was a lot better than I expected.

The cucumber sauce (we know it as tzatziki) was great, although I couldnt get hold of any mint, fresh or dried, so left it out. I've just returned from a holiday in Greece so this was a fantastic meal for us to relive the wonderful food there! I will definitely be making again, thanks for sharing.","Great chicken!

I will make this often!","Very easy and very good!!\n\nI used the more pedestrian versions of some of the ingredients and it still came out great.","Absolutely fabulous.  I didn't have time to marinade the chicken for but 20 minutes.  The taste and mixture of ingredients were fa nominal.  I can't imagine how even more delicious it is with the marinade at 24 hours.  The cucumber sauce was also one of the best we have ever had.  I didn't have mint, and substituted tarragon in it's place.  It worked perfectly.","Very, very good.  I've made it several times now and it's fabulous.  Incidentally, the tzatziki is the best recipe I've come across.  I modified the yogurt\/mayo ratio to around 1.5\/.5, and it's still great.  This recipe goes great with greek pilafi.","Made this very easy and very nice recipe with strips of chicken breast and put them in a pita pocket with some lettuce, onion, and sliced tomatoes (gyros style) with tzatziki sauce. This is a nice recipe for the tzatziki, using fresh mint. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken or fire up the gril, but the flavors came through just fine because I pan fried the chicken and the marinade together in a skillet on medium heat. As the chicken cooked, the marinade reduced and evaporated...then the chicken quickly browned beautifully, with a coating of those concentrated flavors.","Loved this recipe! The only difference is that I used chicken thighs which were soooo good. I made this with the sauce and kittencal's greek salad. Thank you for this yummy recipe.","This recipe is just wonderful. I marinated the chicken overnight. The next day, I spread all the chicken cubes on a baking sheet and broiled them. I made a triple batch because I was planning on using them for a party that had to be canceled. They were gone in two days with only 3 people in the house. I literally had to hide them from my son because he couldn't keep his hands off. He just kept popping them in his mouth. I ate them on a Greek salad. They ate them in pita pockets stuffed with veggies. The cucumber sauce was great too. Thanks. I will be making this again!","This recipe is delicious!  I marinated chicken cubes for about 8 hours and it was perfect.  The cucumber sauce is amazing!  I had originally purchased a cucumber sauce that had expired so I made this one instead and glad I did.  I haven't tasted a better one!...though I might go a little lighter on the salt next time.  Will be making this for company!   Thanks!","Very nice:)  I have a wheat allergy so this was a great recipe - completely wheat free.  I added some homemade hummus. It was delicious!","Delish chicken. I didn't make the sauce, but the chicken is very flavorful and moist. Thanks!","Very nice.  I enjoyed the marinade and grilled the chicken which had a great flavor. I did change the cucumber sauce a bit adding some fresh lemon juice and no mayonnaise.  I prefer greek yogurt for my sauce. I actually served mine in a Naan bread with, diced tomatoes and some crisp lettuce.  It made a great sandwich.  I could easily served it as a full meal as well.  Very nice flavors.

Even non-salmon eaters will like this salmon.","I really love salmon and I\\\\\\'m always looking for new ways to make it. The salmon has a much better flavor if you marinade for SEVERAL hours or overnight.","absolutely delicious.  A big hit and easy to make.","This was good, but with all of the other strong flavors, I couldn't taste any bourbon at all. I think next time I will increase the amount of bourbon in the recipe. ","Wonderful marinade. I used my sealing machine to marinade in 10+ minutes. My son and I both loved it -- and I generally do not eat fish.\r\n\r\nI had about 1.6lbs of salmon cut into 4 filets. The recipe here was sufficient for that. I pan cooked for 8 minutes on each side starting with skin side down. I still spooned some marinade over the filets and covered while they cooked.","I took the advice of Girl Friday and increased the bourbon quite a bit. I really wanted that flavor to come through. It turned out great, slightly carmelized on the outside, tender and delicious on the inside. This is a great marinade for fish, but would also be good for chicken or pork. Served with balsamic asparagus, cinnamon-butter yeast rolls, and roasted herb potatoes. Yum!","I scaled this down for one and it came out very nicely! I served with corn on the cob and fresh sliced ripe tomatoes. Thanks!","This was WONDERFUL!!! I've never had Salmon, and my husband found this recipe & tried it....I couldn't stop taking \"just one more bite\"!  We will definitely be making this again & again!  Thank you!","Have made this a few times now.  Doesn't matter about the juice, use OJ if no pineapple.  I added extra bourbon or JD. I also used sesame oil instead of veg.  Grated ginger is great too.  I also added cornstarch to reserve, heated and served it over top the salmon.  You can do so much with this as a base.  GREAT recipe!","I made this last week with Copper River salmon.  At first I was concerned with the amount of oil called for because salmon is quite oily naturally but it worked out fine.  I may never prepare salmon any other way again...it was that delicious!  It's just the perfect light accent to the freshness of the fish...thanks for a fabulous recipe!","This was AWESOME!  I grilled this on a cedar plank for about 25 minutes, and it was theeee best salmon I've ever had!  The family also gobbled this up, no complaints.  Great recipe!","This is the exact recipe that Lone Star uses. The only difference is that they marinade for three days. YUMMY! Thanks.","Very good, but needs to marinate several hours, one hour is just not enough to really get the flavor.","This was really good.  I marinated it for two days, and as others suggested, added a *bit* more bourbon!  ;)\r\nThe flavor was still very mild, but it complemented the salmon nicely.  Yum!  I would give it 5 stars, rest of the family said it was good but they wished the marinade had a deeper flavor.","Made this for dinner tonight for my wife, and her boss and his wife. They all loved it, They dine in some pretty fancy restaurants and they were impressed.  Followed recipe but took advice from one review to marinate for several days  WOW !!!\nServed with baked sweet potato and Brussels Sprouts #378366. Dessert was a Chocolate Carmel  Bar.  Bill K #1440799","I have made this many times but finally had to comment. My family loves this. My daughter would never even touch any fish until i made this. I like using orange juice instead of the pineapple. Great recipe!","Boy! was this good!!!  Made this recipe for 4th of July for 10 people and it drew raves!!  Everyone commented on how much they liked the sweetness of the pineapple taste.  Of course, like others have suggested, I marinated for 3 days AND used more bourbon (about 3 ounces), and sesame oil.  One additional touch, I cooked the filets on cedar planks on my gas bbq.  Result -- FANTASTIC!!  Served with my Corn-Tomato-and-Black-Bean-Salsa.  Made a big hit!!","Delicious!!  We made this for a birthday dinner for my dad, who loves fish.  I doubled the recipe and marinated the salmon for maybe 2 hours and the only change we made was to grill it on cedar planks.  It got rave reviews and I would definitely make this again!  Thank you!!","Loved this!  I'm not a fish\/seafood lover, but hubby is and I still loved it.

Initially, I was skeptical of the Miracle Whip, but it gave this soup that inimitable \"something\", that was just right.

I'm glad I listened!","This was super!  My husband loved it, and he's not a big soup eater.  The mayonaise is the \"secret ingredient\" that makes it German, I think.  I used regular mayo and added 1\/4 cup sugar - works just the same.  I also left out the process cheese and substituted Parmesan cheese for the Swiss.

I wanted a potato soup recipe at the last minute and just picked this one.  No need to go any father.  This is THE potato soup.

Garlic does a body good...","Perfect!! So very rich and cheesy. Since my husband thinks a meal is incomplete without some sort of meat, I added about 1 cup of sliced  german sausage and it gave this just the right amount of spiciness without too much meat.","We love this. The second time we made it we threw the celery and carrots into the food processor, because we wanted a smoother texture. Instead of water and chicken boullioun I just use chicken stock. Overall Fantastic!","Oh this was delicious another 5 stars form the family.  The only thing I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have was the sweet red peppers somehow I over looked them.

I, too, used all chicken stock, but I couldn't bring myself to add the mayo...it was fabulous. I also used an immersion blender at the end for a smoother texture. This will be one of my regulars. Thank you, Dave!","Really delicious!  I followed another posters suggestion and chopped down the carrots in a blender.....just pulse.....Creamy, and the most decadent soup I have ever experienced.  I do recommend tasting towards the end.....You will most likely want to salt and pepper to your liking!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!","This soup was awesome!  I would probably omit the mayonnaise.  I also added bacon and it tasted great, I think adding bacon to many soups is a German way.  The consistency of this soup I will try to change somehow it reminded me of curdled milk so I will probably omit the potato flakes and the mayonnaise hoping it will just be smoother.  I made this last night and I will make it again for it reminds me of my mom & Grandma's German poatato soup.  Oh and I didn't have any red pepper but it was still very filling!","Thanks for steering to this one Uncle Bill. Its outstanding! (as was expected). Took me a minute to understand the soup base ingredient. Essentially, I made 4 cups of chicken broth and then added 2.5 cups of veggie broth (or chicken broth if you choose). The cheese combination was perfectly balanced. Not overly cheesy... just well balanced. Next time I'm going to change the brand of instant potatoes I used (it made the texture a little grainy) but the soup was fabulous nonetheless. THanks.

But they turned out great! Super easy to make and delicious. I now get why everyone loves corn dogs!","Tasty and easy to make what more could a busy mom ask for?!","What a treat, especially with cheese-filled hot dogs. I picked up a couple tips from other reicpes on this site: (1) Pat the dogs dry with a paper towel before dipping, and (2) Put the batter in a tall glass to dip. We put them on wooden skewers for frying, and also put a bit of hot pepper in the batter for more flavor. Quick and easy, and practically no dishes to wash!","This turned out pretty good!  We made them without sticks, which turned out just as easy to do.  Our oil had gotten hotter than 375, so they only took about 2 minutes to cook. We had leftover batter, which we dropped into the oil to fry too, and they turned out as delicious little pastries!","I followed directions to the letter, and wound up with naked cooked hotdogs, and a bunch of cornmeal swimming around them.  I did put it all in a bowl, put some mustard in it and it tasted good, it just didn't stick to the dogs at all.","This was an easy recipe to make, I needed to add about an extra tablespoon of milk and dusting the hotdogs with flour helps keep the batter on the dogs.","What I could salvage was good. The batter doesn't stick to the hot dog and the dog sticks in the deep fryer when you try to take it out.","I added 1 t dry mustard, paprika, a dash of cayenne and also used 1\/2 polenta and 1\/2 corn 'flour' for the cornmeal component.  I cut 'village keilbasa' (selsko kolbacitz) in half, blotted them with paper towels and lightly dusted them with flour before dunking them in the batter.  They held together just fine in my deep fryer.  My guests said they were great, but I am coming down with cold, so unfortunately, nothing tasted good to me last night :-(.  I used the excess batter to make some impromptu onion wedges.  Everything got eaten!  Will try again and update the review to reflect a non-illness influenced personal opinion!","I added a few T of sugar to the batter- we wanted a sweeter taste, like they serve at the fair here.  Floured the hot dog and put batter in a glass- very easy- batter stuck on great.\r\nKids enjoyed.","The key for success is to thoroughly dry the hot dogs and then dust them with flour so that the batter will adhere easily. Also, BYOC (Be Your Own Chef) by trying to add other ingredients to the batter..ie cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, dry mustard or even sugar or a few.","Very easy and very good!  I had to make with water because we were out of milk.  I found that as long as the dogs were rolled in flour first the batter stuck perfectly!  I made a double batch and 3 pkgs of hot dogs.  GONE in less than 30 minutes!  Thank you for the recipe =]","Thank you for a really good recipe!  I made these tonight for my kids and they thought they were great.  I had to add about a quarter of a cup more milk as the batter was just too thick.  Excellent idea to dip them in a tall glass!  WIll use this one again  :)","These fried up beautifully.  I did thin my batter a bit, it seemed to stick to the dog better.  I can't believe how simpe these were.  And so much cheaper then buying corn dogs.  Thank you so much for this recipe, as my family loves corndogs.  I can make this alot more for them.","My family and I really enjoyed these corn dogs. They were a lot of fun to make. I did have to add about 1\/2 cup more of milk as the batter was a bit thick. We poured the batter in a 20 oz. styrofoam cup and it worked great for dipping then just threw it away for easy clean up. The corn dogs turned out brown and crunchy. Just delicious !! Will be making again. Thank you for the recipe !","Just like I said for my home state of Illinois, I'll say here for my neighbor across the river....Iowa. This doesn't represent Iowa at all in the area where I spent my life. I was born and raised in Illinois, but we crossed the bridge over the Mississippi and were in Davenport, Iowa. People in our neck of the woods live for Pork. And the favorite dish in the bi-state area where I'm from, is the Pork Tenderloin. A piece of pork loin is flattened out so it's as big as your head, fried in a crust like you'd use for chicken fried steak, then put on a hamburger bun which makes it look ridiculously small when the pork is as big as a dinner plate!

I think this could have had a richer flavour, and if I could eat kidneys and had left them in-I'm sure it would have! I added more herbs and salt and pepper to compensate. I was worried about heating a Corning Ware casserole, then pouring in cold batter, so I made this in a cake pan. Out of interest, I found a six cup one in my cupboard. It wasn't large enough to hold all the batter and stew mixture, so I would suggest using an 8 cup dish\/pan. Thanks Honni for a dinner we all enjoyed.","The snow is falling hard here in Upstate NY and this stew was perfect.  I adapted it a little.  We used steak only and left out the kidneys.  Just after the meat was done browning I added a touch or two of some Merlot, reduced that and removed it from the pan.  Then I browned the onions in a bit more oil.  Didn't have tarragon, used a bit of sage, basil, and thyme.  This is not the first time I've made this and it won't be the last!  Thanks!","Oh YUM.

I had some difficulty in getting my pud to rise though, it really stayed small and flat with the stew in the middle.  That said it was delicious and perfect for the rainy cool day yesterday.","This was warm, filling, and delicious!  I am not able to use the kidneys, and didn't even have any steak on hand, so I had to modify it somewhat severely and use ground beef and some chicken breasts.  I also couldn't use the dairy milk for the pudding part, so substituted coconut milk.  That said, if you can accept that it was the same recipe made as posted, this was a wonderful dinner!  I served it with mashed potatoes, as suggested, and broccoli on the side.  The pudding puffed up beautifully and browned to a nice crunch around the edges.  The gravy was divine.   I would also add that at least in my family, this made 6 hearty servings and not just 4.  Thanks for adopting this recipe, Honni!","This is a great dish. I make it minus the kidneys and use a claret wine. It is a tender, flavorful, filling, hot meal that has taken the place of \"regular\" stew in our home.","I made the yorkshire pudding base for chicken pot pie and it was absolutely deliscious.

Based on my travels to the various countries including Europe, Asia and US, this version of French Onion soup is one of the best I've had. My husband who is from London just loves this recipe.\r\n\r\nIt is robust and hearty in beef and onion flavour and quite thick so you can enjoy this as a meal in itself (you might say it's great comfort food).  Be sure to use the broiler until the cheese bubbles and turns golden brown over the French bread. Tip: Try to use the fresh French bread which is a bit chewy in texture.    \r\n\r\nBon Appetit.","Absolutely Delightful Recipe! Rich and Flavorful!","Aren't there 6 or seven stars to choose from.  WOW!  I was so excited to see this recipe.  I absolutely loved this soup when my husband and I would go to Famous Barr 30 years, when he was in the seminary at Concordia St. Louis.  I have made it through the years, because an aunt had sent me the recipe from her local Springfield, IL newspaper about 20 years.  Once I lost it, but a friend retrieved it for me from the time she had asked me for it.  What I love about your site is the instant way to double or triple or whatever the recipe!  I make this recipe a number of times each year, but I always make it for a big Christmas Party we have.  Everyone loves it and looks forward to it each year!  Thanks so much!  I always serve it with homemade bread and a Ceasar Salad.  I look forward to your newsletters.","It is the most delicious onion soup I have even eaten, and when I lived in St. Louis I would eat it at least twice a week, especially on Friday.","Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Live on the East Coast now and can't find a restaurant that can compare to this.  I remember going to St.Louis for Weekends with my parents.  Famous Bar For lunch was a definite.  Always ordered the French Onion Soup.  We would stay at the Mayfair Hotel and always had the Mayfair Salad with dinner. I know have the recipe for Mayfair Dressing.  This just completes it for me.","I finally got around to making this and kick myself for not doing so sooner.  This is just a fabulous French Onion soup.  The only \"drawback\" is processing the onions.  Believe it or not, I put on swim goggles processing them!!!  Maybe I just had extra potent onions???  But once that was done the rest was just a matter of time and the results were outstanding.  I have several frozen lumps of French Onion soup to enjoy for some time to come  (like tonight).  Thank you for posting this one Bill.  I usually don't say I'll do this one again but. . . . I'll do this one again.","I had the time so cooked the onions for about three hours before adding broth.  Very nice flavor and appearance.  Will make this my new standard recipe.  Thank you!","I have this same exact recipe and make it when I long for the 'good-ole-days' when I lived in St. Louis and ate at the Famous Barr restaurant.  I had a hard time ordering anything else but this soup.  It's a meal in itself.  The recipe is very very close to the real thing!  Rich, smooth, oniony, and the best part, the slice of crusty bread on top covered with cheese that strings from the bowl to your mouth! A MUST try for any onion soup lovers!  For those watching their salt....use the low-sodium beef broth like I do. ","Perfect \r\nOne of the best I have had,  A nice stock recipe #80434 works well with this soup.  A long cooking time but not a lot of work to make   \r\nBetter then many restaurants \r\nHave used vidalia onions and put in two large onions per person I am making it for  also used pre sliced baugette and dried the bread in the oven before using in the soup","Oh WOW.  I cannot get my nose (or spoon) out of the soup pot!  I had heard of this soup from a St. Louis native, and finally got a chance to make it today.  I agree completely with the other reviews about this being the best French Onion soup I've ever tasted. The French couldn't do it any better.  I didn't add any extra salt to this since I used salted butter; the flavor is outstanding.  A Hands Down favorite!","Used to eat this at Famous as a kid.  Loved it but the old lady watresses would only serve kids if they were with an adult.  I found out over the years alot of us as kids couldn't get served at Famous.","Thanks to my brother for passing this recipe along to me.  I made it orginally for my son, but now make it for ME!  To save calories I don't even add the cheese, and it's still great.  Very warm and smooth.  Sweet onions have been on sale, and when they are, the recipe comes out.  Freezes great for lunches.","A really good soup.  French onion is my husband's favorite, and he loved the recipe.  I omitted the bay leaf, caramel color, and the white wine because I did not have them on hand.  I used a homemade French baguette sliced and dried out in at 250 degrees in the oven for about 15 minutes.  I then added monzarella cheese on top and toasted until the cheese was bubbly and slightly browned.  I then added the bread to the bowls of hot soup.  \nI do not own any oven crocks that I could have broiled the bread and cheese in, but making the cheese toast separately worked really well for me.  I also used the Swanson's broth.  With the Swanson's Broth the color was right on, so I am not sure if the caramel color is really even necessary.\n\nThanks for a great recipe.","My mother and I would shop at Famous when I was young, and no trip was complete without having lunch, talk about a memory in a bowl!","This is a fabulous recipe!   I didn't have caramel color, but it really was a rich color on its own.  I did add about 1\/2 tsp of nutmeg to it (which I have used from other recipes).   I also deleted the salt, as I found there to be enough of a salty taste on its own (just right!)\r\nA rich and wonderful soup that makes my mouth water at the thought of it!","I have never heard of Famous Barr's but This is awesome soup, I halved the recipe, and I wish I didnt, I should have made the whole thing and frozen half.  I think the thing that makes this recipe work is cooking the onions for an hour and a half, the smell in my kitchen !!!!!! excellent recipe Bill,and easy to make. thanks","This was great..made it for a super bowl party and most thought it was super..sorry no pun..just make sure you make enough for all to have seconds..Thanks","All I can say is YUM!!  I made the whole recipe, the family and sis-in-law ate some for lunch and I froze the rest. It is great for lunches that you can heat up. I take bread and cheese on the side to stick in after I microwave it!!  Thanks Bill.","Oh gosh. This soup was to die for! I've been wanting to make French onion soup for quite some time and this definitely didn't disappoint! This was really simple to make and while it does take a while, it's definitely worth it! The only thing I really did differently was change the amount of some things a bit (less butter) and I added some minced garlic when the onions were nearly finished. I can't wait to make this again (when I'm brave enough to slice all those onions again!) Thank you!","Everyone we make this for, raves about it.","Good, but it was still missing *something* I couldn't put my finger on.  I added more salt & pepper after cooking, then added about 1 TBS of Worcestershire sauce and 1\/4 grated Parmesan.  Helped.  Next time, I'll use less paprika and a sharper, maybe cave-aged Gruyere to add a little \"sumthin-sumthin.\" Thanks for a good start!","Very reminiscent of a recent trip to Paris.... This soup is delicious - great depth of flavour.  I also added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce.","Oh, so wonderful! I skipped caramel coloring. I made six gallons of the stuff for an event -- It doubles (sextuples!) well and reheats nicely after being frozen. Yum.","I'll add my 5 star rating to the rest. Very thick and creamy. Excellent.","This soup was delicious.  I used vidalia onions, so it was probably sweeter than if I had used plain yellow ones.  I melted provolone cheese on the top, which balanced the sweetness, and it was excellent.  After reading the reviews, I decided to make the whole recipe, and I'm so glad I did.  This soup is just wonderful and I'm glad I had enough left over to freeze (and send home with a guest). \nThank you for this recipe!","easy to make and delilcious to eat!Zolad2@aol.com","This was very rich, and wonderful. I love French Onion Soup, but sometimes onions in the quantity upset my stomach.  This version did not, and I attribute it to cooking the onions slowly for a long time. Because I did not read the recipe far enough in advance, I was only able to cook them for an hour before adding the other ingredients, and I did not refrigerate overnight.  Also, I only had hot paprika on hand, so I only used half. It actually gave it a nice bite. Definite keeper!","I must have had some powerful onions because everyone in the house was crying when I started making it.  However, everyone proclaimed it well worth it after it was finished.  It was fabulous!  I made it exactly according to the directions except we didnt refrigerate it overnight.  I will make this again and again, and I am sure my family will insist that I do so!  Thanks!","I've just got to say \"THANKS\". The first time I ever had French onion soup was when my aunt took me to a Famous Barr store in Alton, IL just across the river from STL. I never dreamed I would find the recipe. Thanks so much for posting!!!!","Apparently I was so overwhelmed with this recipe that I forgot to review it....!!!\r\n\r\nTHis is absolutely FANTASTIC, and most likely the ONLY recipe I'll use for French Onion Soup in future.\r\n\r\nOne thing I took away from this recipe is that the method for carmelizing the onions was absolutely fantastic. Even if I didn't LOVE the soup, I would certainly keep this recipe for cooked onions!\r\n...Thanks, Bro! : )","Having gone to graduate school in St. Louis (go Cardinals!!!), I had to try this one.  It is so good and we had alot left over.  Toasted french bread with swiss cheese melted on it tops it off great.  Thanks Brother!!","Thanks you for this recipe, as a teenager I used to always enjoy a bowl of this famous soup at Famous Barr in Springfield, IL, I made a soup but this is awesome and brings back so many memories.. thanks again.","I looked this up as soon as I found Recipe Zaar because I decided that this site was only as good as the great recipes I could find.  This is one of the best soups in the world (can you tell I grew up on it?).  The best part of it is the Gruyere cheese.  There's just something different about it from plain old Swiss!  Thanks for bringing back wonderful soup memories!","Way back my mother somehow got the recipe and I've been enjoying it for years and years. Glad to see it posted as it is too good not to share. The gruyere cheese is the best on this!! Thank you for submitting this.","My parents are from the St. Louis area and this is the French Onion Soup that my mom makes. We always had this as part of our Christmas Dinner. This is a great recipe!","Delicious soup, simple to make, although the onions take ages,it is really worth it to give depth to the flavour of the soup. My children had been in the states this summer and raved about the onion soup they tried out there saying it was better than their Grans! When they tried this one they said it was just as good as the one in USA. Thanks for posting.","Loved it! Comfort food at its best!","PERFECT!!! My family loved this soup. I liked the thicker consistency this soup has. This is \"my\" onion soup from now on, thanks brother William!!!","OH MY GOD!  I just made this soup to serve for Christmas dinner and just off the stove, it's divine.  I know I have to let it sit overnight to let the flavors meld, but I couldn't help getting a crescent roll left over from last night and dipping it in some soup that I didn't put in the refrigerated container :) -- so yummy.  \r\n\r\nI made French Onion soup years ago a different way and it wasn't nearly as good as this.  I didn't add the caramel color or the kitchen bouquet, it seems to be darkish without it.  \r\n\r\nI also halved the recipe for 8 people, but I think that if you're serving 8 you should just make the entire recipe.  It made about 4 qts of soup but if I put it in my crocks w\/the french bread\/cheese, they may look a little bit low.  \r\n\r\nJust make the whole recipe and you won't be sorry.","This soup is outstanding! I was tempted into making it after ordering a terrible FOS in a Cheltenham restaurant last night. \r\n\r\nI had to cut the receipe down quite a bit - used 2 very large onions, reduced amount of butter and seasoning and then one part beef stock, one part dry wine and one part Joubere beef gravy instead of the flour.  Probably sounds like a hatchet job, but it has turned out to be absolutely delicious!  Did not have to use the caramel colouring or the kitchen bouquet.  I'll be serving it tomorrow for lunch, with the bread and gruyere, and I can't wait.\r\n\r\nIMHO, what makes this recipe is taking the time to slow cook the onions and adding a good, dry wine like Sancerre.  Thanks Brother William!!","5 stars!  I've never made French Onion Soup before, but enjoyed it out at a restaurant. This was easy to make and my husband and I both enjoyed eating this on this cold winter night.  I think next time I will make this using home made beef stock.  The addition of the wine really makes this superb. We both agree this is better than we've ever had at a restaurant!  Thank you so much Brother William for sharing this wonderful recipe!","Super delicious winter warming soup! Great recipe for a classic! Make much more than you think you need, it will all be gone!","Fantastic!  I didn't have any paprika, so I skipped it and I didn't add the carmel coloring, I just cooked the onions to a deep golden brown. This recipe is definitely a keeper!","My Dad drives to the nearest Outback every other week (about 1 hour away) just because he LOVES their french onion soup.  So I surprised him and made this when we had my parents over for dinner last night and he LOVED it!  He had 4 bowls of it! I wore swim goggles while I cut the onions!  I made according to the recipe but omitted steps 8,9,10. I also did not use the bay leaf. We served this along with a pork loin and 4 sides and no one hardly touched anything besides the soup!!! We served with Pillsbury Crusty Rolls. LOVE IT!","Nice flavor, really nice color to the soup without using the coloring.","Loved the  soup. Recipe was easy to follow.  Didn't use coloring, mine was dark enough. Only change I made was cut out 2 cups of the broth, I like it a bit thicker, and added a splash of worchestershire sauce for a little bite.  Other than that, it was awesome!\r\nThanks Brother William for a wonderful comfort food.","Excellent soup.  The whole family really enjoyed it!  BTW there was no left overs for tomorrow.","excellent.  i also added a bit of worcestshire, and also added a little garlic. used Riesling white wine and dipped sour dough bread.","Absolutely fantastic soup.  Impossible to mess up, even better, it makes itself.  Referred this to many friends who have trouble in the kitchen and it continues to please.","To us the soup \"was missing something\".....we added a little onion powder, and some cumin, and some garlic salt, but it still was missing something.\r\nWe didn't add the White Wine, as we forgot to pick it up at the store, so maybe that was it...\r\nOtherwise it tased pretty good, onions were sweet and not an overpowering onion flavor, and once we ate it with some cheese and croutons it was even better...\r\nstill trying to figure out what its missing though.....hmmmmmm","I used 8 cups homemade pork broth and 4 cups french onion dry soup mix. Tasty.","Something my Dad taught me. Add a couple of Tbs. Brown sugar, or Molases","If I could give it 10 stars I would. Me and my family loved it, easily the best I've ever had. The only changes I made were using part beef brorh, part beef consomme (what was on hand) and I added about a tablespoon of molasses suggested from one of the reviewers.","This is delicious.  DH said sweetheart this is wonderful.  Can't beat that ha?  I added a little cayenne at his request but he likes cayenne in almost everything.  Gloria","Good for my first try.","This is one outstanding soup!  I followed the directions to the letter and it came out really well.  Loved the addition of the wine with the beef broth.  Such good flavors in this soup. We loved it here! Don","I love this soup!  Simple to make, very tasety and I always have everything I need in my kithchen to make it.  When I don't have bread on hand, I substitute large croutons.  Thanks for a keeper Bill!","This was pretty good.  Definitely a departure from the traditional thin french onion soup.  I especially liked the method you used to thicken it and will use that method in other recipes.  Thanks for posting!","I loved this soup it was so yummy!  I ommited the white wine and i used provolone cheese!  Really good will use again!","This St. Louisan TOTALLY AGREES that this has got to be the BEST Onion Soup ever!!   I worked downtown near Famous Barr and we would go there often just for the soup!   \r\nDarlene, St. Louis, MO","Best French Onion Soup ever.  I think the paprika, butter, and the slow cooking is what makes it stand out.  I didn't have any beef broth but cubes and a can of consumme.  I never used wine but maybe next time I will, as it will be the recipe I use from now on!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!","Outstanding recipe!  I used 1\/4 stick butter plus 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and only 1\/2 cup of wine, otherwise it was made to direction and it was to die for! (it didn't need the caramel coloring)  Thank you for a wonderful recipe :)","OMG this sounds heavenly. I am going to make it tomorrow night. I have some delicious candy onions and they should work out great!\r\nThis must be from a 5 star restaurant!\r\nI'm psyched! HotPepperRosemaryJelly","This is a good recipe but I doctored a bit.  Added 2 slices of apple wood cured bacon to the onions, very nice flavor.   I halved the recipe but slightly overdid the pepper.  To make up for this, i added 2 full cups of a dry Bordeaux and 2 cups of beer.  I also added a couple of drops of tobasco to offset the heat from the black pepper.  Also added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  Half recipe made 4 large bowls with a little bit left over, everyone cleaned their bowls out.  Wow, what an amazing taste","This is absolutely the best recipe for French Onion Soup. Having grown up in St. Louis and frequenting the Famous Barr restaurant, I truly appreciate being able to make my own batch of this yummy stuff, and have lots leftover. Will post my pics soon. THANKS!!!","Love onion soup,sorry but not this one. I belive too many onions.\r\nhad a strange flavor. Made no changes.","I've been craving French Onion Soup and this one definately filled the bill. As much as we enjoyed it the day I made it, we enjoyed it even more the second day, and I still had some to freeze for later.  Thanks, Brother!","The broth from #103403 with this recipe as a guide is wonderful. So if you are looking for a double duty recipe, start with #103403, then serve this yummy soup with the extra broth the next day or so!","This was wonderful!  I made the recipe exactly as described and I can only say I wish it made more. I could eat this every day.  Thank you so much for a delicious recipe!","Sorry but we were disappointed.  I had made a different recipe and it was much better.  This took three times as long and didn't have the flavor.","We had three dinner parties in a row and served this each night.  All loved the soup. We used vermouth for the wine.  Will make over and over.","This was really good and my husband loved it.  Made recipe as stated except omitted wine.  Next time will add more onions than called for.","This was fabulous! I had to improvise a bit as I did not have canned broth in the house. I used Bovril beef bouillon concentrate and I did not have wine available. I had unexpected company show up just before dinner so I had to add a pkt of onion soup to stretch it out further. It still tasted great even after that. Next time I want to make it to the letter. I am sure it will be even better! Thank you for posting. \r\nUpdate.... I have made this a few more times     ( to the letter and with substitutions... a very forgiving recipe) we have loved it every time, thank you again","Very enjoyable.  I made the recipe as called for without the addition for caramel coloring.  It made so much that I immediately froze half of the soup.  In the future, I think I will half the recipe.  That will still allow me to freeze a quart and eat the other half right away.  I will also splurge on the gruyere next time as I think the flavor makes a BIG difference - swiss doesn't really come close.","This is the BEST French Onion Soup recipe!!!!!! The house reeks when you first start but the end result is well worth it!!!  Thank you so very much!!!!!","I grew up in St. Louis and know this soup well but my first time eating it was not easy.  I had a mental picture of a big smelly onion. How could this be called  soup. Ahh but  when it was served the aroma was so good, it was only exceded by it's taste.  That was 45 yrs ago. thanks for the recipe and memories","High praise from 8 of my Valentine's Day Dinner guests who all wanted the recipe!  I stored it overnight in the crock pot that I used to simmer it for 2 extra hours the day that I served it.  To avoid having to handle oven hot servings, I took the advice of another reviewer and broiled gruyere cheese onto toasted french bread. Then I put the bread on top of each half filled bowl and spooned hot soup on top until each bowl was full. So easy and so pretty for a formal dinner.  Simply fabulous without wine or coloring!","Next time, I plan on making this in the crock pot or leave the house for a few hours so it can simmer in peace. Since I started making this, I have been munching on it and it's a wonder there's any left. The longer you can stand to let it simmer (it smells delicious while cooking) the more the flavours come out. I halved the recipe as I'm the only one in a two-person household who eats onions -- plus, I had just about 2.5 lbs, exactly, to use up. Another recipe I saw called for brown sugar to carmelize the onions. I gave that a shot and added about 3\/4 tsp. of dark brown sugar. I didn't notice a difference in the taste. I used 4 bullion cubes in about 3.5 cups of water. When I was making the flour thickening, I added more flour than I intended and thinned it out with more broth until I got it to a consistency I liked. I didn't bother with the caramel colouring as I didn't have it on hand or thought the soup needed it. I did have to substitute provolone cheese for the gruyere, but the soup is fantastic without it too. Thanks for sharing a lip-smackingly delicious recipe. Will most definitely be making this again.","Great soup flavor and aroma while cooking!  We loved this served the day it cooked, and leftover.  I used a prepared (low sodium, no-msg) commercial beef broth which had a rich enough color that I did not need to use caramel coloring.  However, the flavor of the broth was strong (prefer the onion flavor to be the strongest!) and next time I will use a homemade broth.  The recipe refered to onions \"unpeeled.\"  I didn't know if this meant to leave the skins on, but I did peel the onion skins off before slicing.  Will make this again--thanks for sharing a fool-proof fantastic recipe.","Great recipe!  After the prep, I stuck it in the crock pot to simmer for a few hours.  The smell was wonderful.  I've made other onion soups, but this was the best, and hubby loved it too.  I didn't have any white wine or caramel coloring, but it was excellent without them.  Served with a baguette that I broiled swiss cheese on.  Great leftover, and I even froze a small amount for lunch one day.  Thanks!","I didn't use the wine or the caramel coloring. \r\nI also added garlic. It was wonderful. \r\nMy husband said it's the best French onion soup he's ever had. I doubled the recipe and it froze like a dream! Absolutely will make this again!","This french onion soup is very very good!  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton of soup!  I did not use the caramel coloring or kitchen bouquet and it it still came out quite dark and nice.  I also served with sliced mozzarella and sliced french baguette bread per preference.  The smell of the sauteed onions in butter was awesome! This was SO easy to make!  I would definitely recommend!  Thanks for posting Bill!","Fantastic recipe.  I made it without the KB or caramel coloring as well and it was lovely.  Served it with Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, yum.  Thanks for posting Bill.","Delicious!\n\nI used canola oil instead of butter and chicken powder dissolved in water, instead of the beef broth. I also left out the caramel coloring.","I can't say it much better than the 84 reviewers before me except that it was 'OUT OF THIS WORLD' good!!\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing a keeper of a recipe!","Yum! Really enjoyed this! Used recipe #438574 and only 3 32-oz. cartons of organic beef broth (equivalent of 6 cans).  From other reviews I thought this might be a problem but it wasn't overly thick. Froze the remainder in individual servings, along with individual croutons (toasted French bread topped with Swiss cheese and broiled) in a separate bag for a quick meal. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","Years ago, I was given this recipe and stored it securely with other cherished recipes.  Recently, I searched thoroughly and could not find it.  One night, it occurred to me...find it on the internet.  Over the years, I've tried other French Onion Soups at various cafes and restaurants.  What I found was that there is NO comparison.  This is, by far, the BEST THERE IS.  The rich, thick consistency allows the baguette to float beautifully atop the soup.  Also, I used gruyere and found it added more than the swiss.","This is wonderful.  We used vegetarian broth (Cambell's).  Up to now, all French Onion soup since we became veggies has been disappointing.  This one is thick, rich, and delicious.  Perfect! Perfect!","Absolutely the best!","Made this exactly as directed. Believe it or not the 4 of us ate it until gone! I served as an appetizer but I had to put the actual dinner I made away to eat another day because we were too full from eating the soup!","This soup is excellent!!!! Bill, just wanted you to know I'll be blaming you for the 500 lbs. I'll be putting on eating this- can't control myself- LOL!! Thanks again.","We didnt care for this that much, it seemed like it was missing something.","Last reviewer was right! I had high expectations for this soup, and there was something missing. I added a splash of worcestershire sauce and BLISS! Definitely have this in the store cupboard ready incase you feel the same. I would also chop the bread in chunks instead of a slice, as it is hard to chop inside the soup. But overall, a lovely experience making this soup, and eating it  xx","This soup was a big hit and is so hip and thrifty.  We used red wine instead of white, and because we used a homemade beef broth, we needed to add a lot more salt to give it the oomph.  The long simmering of the onions is key.  And as the soup mellows into itself throughout the days, it just keeps getting better and better.","This was voted best soup at the soup potluck dinner I went to last night (in St Louis!). I love making the large batch this recipe calls for, I freeze it and eat it all winter. I don't like lots of salt in my soup, so I make it with 32 oz of low sodium beef broth and add water for the remaining liquid. I also add 1.5 lbs of beef, cubed, and this makes up for diluting the broth. Somehow the sweetness of the soup omits the need for more salt. One thing I've noticed is that you really must scrape the bottom of the pot throughout the cooking process! Thank you for posting this wonderful soup.","I made this a couple of years ago and never rated it - shame on me! This a great soup.  I get cravings for it now and just have to make it.  I have never had the Famous Barr's French Onion Soup - but I always ate Houlihans - and this is hands down better.  I made this as directed and only made one addition of about 1-2 Tbsp Worcheswtershire sauce - this soup ROCKS!","Awesome soup!!! I think it rivals Panera Bread's French Onion Soup. This will be the ONLY French Onion Soup recipe that I use for now on.\nThank you very much for posting.","This was excellent soup. Totally forgot to take a pic of it though. But I will next time I have it. I used sweet vidalia onions. I also had put in about 2 Tbs. of Worchestire sauce instead of Kitchen Bouquet and did not put any salt in it.  I did use the wine but I think I would like to try sherry the next time. I find it adds a little different taste. The house smells so good when this is simmering. I chose to go with gruyere cheese. Personally I find this is the perfect cheese for this soup. Delicious flavor of sweet onions and a fantastic broth. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe Bill it was much appreciated.","I have tried different recipes and this one is hands down the BEST one!  I didn't let it sit overnight and was still great.  The only change I made was cutting the recipe in half and I wish I didn't because it would have been great to freeze the leftovers.  I used the Gruyere cheese as recommended.  Thanks for a great recipe!","This recipe is the bomb!! Love it Love it... big fan of french onion soup and cooking the onions for a long time makes such a difference. Thank you for a great recipe","I grew up eating this soup. It is by far the best onion soup you will ever eat. Thank You Famous Barr. It freezes well.","Absolute delicious! Even my four year old loves it! I play with different cheeses- but the soup is always perfect! Thanks!","Oh I DO love this! I started with sweet onions, half spanish sweets and half vidalias. I had no white wine so I used a couple of splashes of shiraz otherwise I followed the recipe....except I added thyme and did not bother to thicken it (I don't think it needed it!). My very discriminating onion soup loving son now worships me (for this evening anyway). Thank you so much for yet another wonderful recipe!","I've been using Food.com for years and this is my first review.  This soup was A-MA-ZING!!!  I have made it twice this week.  All of my boys gobbled it up (ages 7 and under) and my husband just loved it.  I've had wonderful french onion soup before and I was worried that I could never find a comparable recipe---well I just did, and this one is even better.  :)","I'm sorry, I hate giving bad reviews.  I had such high hopes for this soup but it turned out terribly.  Perhaps I just like a more brothy French Onion Soup or maybe it was a weird reaction with my cast iron dutch oven.  It was very thick and the flour was not a good addition.  The paprika was overpowering (which is saying something when it's competing with onions) and tasted off.  My 4 year old loved it and had seconds which is why I gave it two stars but sadly DH and I did not like it at all.  At any rate, give it a whirl, it's worked for more people than not.","Fantastic! The best French Onion soup I have ever made.  It was thick, rich, beautiful colour and the flavour was outstanding.  \nI have deleted all other recipes  saved to try............this is the ONLY one I will ever make from now on.\nI would not change a thing, why mess with perfection.\nThank you so much my Husband\ncould not stop raving.  I can't wait to make this for company.","Fabulous!  I didn't have broth so I used Better Than Boullion paste and warm water to make my broth, and it had an extremely beefy flavor.  Quartered the recipe for two of us, and there was very little left over...Also, I used Vidalia onions as that is what I had.  My husband asked me to make it again some night this week.  I guess I'll have to make a huge batch and freeze it.","Fantastic, since we are vegetarians I used vegetable stock, did everything else the same, for sure the best french onion soup recipe out there, better than any restaurant I've ever had it in (before becoming a vegetarian) and yes, it does freeze well too... YUMMY, I've got another batch on the stove right now as I type this.","Wow, this is some rich french onion soup!  I could only eat a little at a time, but the flavor was really great.  I think next time I will thicken it less as it almost seemed like gravy.  Very good!  Thanks for posting.","This soup is awesome. It takes a little time to make but well worth the effort. My kids even love it and that says a lot.  Thank you for sharing the recipe. Suggestion, wear your kids swim goggles, or the last time I made this I wore my daughter's chemistry goggles. It helps when slicing your onions in the food processor. :>P","This is the best French Onion soup I have ever made or eatten any where. Once you have tasted it you have to have more. So make a BIG pot.","Wow! This soup is so amazing it doesn't even need cheese! My husband and I were licking our  bowls! I followed the recipe but did not include the caramel color or kitchen bouquet. I made a half recipe for the two of us but next time I'll make a full recipe and freeze the rest... if it makes it that long! Thanks for the recipe.","A family friend made this soup and brought it to a potluck.  I had never had French Onion soup before and wasn't very willing to try it at first.  I was finally convinced to try a small dish and OMG I fell in love with french onion soup.  I purchased a can of Campbell's French Onion soup but it doesn't even begin to come close to how good this soup tastes.  I am glad that I found the recipe and now make it myself.  It's really not that hard at all to make.  I have a cuisnart food processor that I used for the onions & that really is the worst part of making the soup the onions.  I just made another batch today...sure it won't last long :)","This is so yummy.  I made this last night and the little girl we had staying with us informed me that she doesn't like onions.  I told her to just try it when its done and see.  Well she was licking her bowl clean AND asking for seconds!!!  This does take some time, so plan ahead, but the results are fantastic.  We loved it.  I didn't use shredded swiss, I just laid a slice across the bowl and it formed a nice \"crust\" on top.  Thank you so much for this restaraunt quality soup.","I have been making this soup for over 20 years and have never found another recipe that even comes close.  It is time consuming but the results are amazing.  The only thing that I do differently is, instead of mixing the flour with a can of broth, I add the flour to the paprika, salt and papper and make a roux by adding the mix to the tenderized onions.  You need to stir constantly because you don't want the mixture to scorch or brown, but you do want to cook it long enough to get the flour taste to disappear.  The roux takes about 10-20 minutes of stirring to get all the flour incorporated with the onion liquid.  After the roux is ready, slowly start adding your liquid, stirring all the time.  The result is a smooth, rich texture.  No lumps and no flour taste.  If it is too thick for your liking, add another can of broth.<br\/><br\/>If you're really ambitious...make your own stock!  You will notice the difference.  No \"can\" taste, more flavor and healthier too!  Enjoy!","I believe that this recipe was created for Famous Barr by Chef Larry Ziegler. Correct me if I'm wrong. I love this soup. I used to work for the restaurant and enjoyed it many times.","I made this exactly as written (it really irks me when prople rate a recipe that they have not made to the letter). As an onion gravy, I would rate this three stars. As a soup, I can't rate it, as to us, this was not a soup. I read ALL the reviews so I made the full amount so we would have plenty for the freezer. I guess we just like our onion soup \"brothy\" and not as sweet- must have been the long cooking that removed the \"oniony\" taste. I guess we fall in the minority here.","This French Onion Soup is the best I've tried.  Very good and it's easy also. I've made this at least 5 times and my family goes crazy over it.  Great soup!!!!!","As I was cooking this, I wasn't so sure of how it would turn out.  It really coated the entire house with the smell of the soup.  I made it to freeze and was glad I did.  Had I eaten it that same day, I may not have liked it since I was kind of done with the smell.  However, after reheating and adding a toasted piece of french bread with shredded gruyere (melted in the oven), it was fantastic. I would not recommend making this for a dinner party and serving the same day.  The smell really was too much and no amount of air freshener helped.  Airing out the house with open windows was the only solution.  Still, overall, I am thrilled with this recipe!  And, it freezes very well.","I am told that I am excellent at making soups and so this recipe, with these reviews surprised me.  I think the overall flavor is great but it is WAY to rich to call a soup.  It seemed just short of a port gravy, of course minus the red wine.  I really wanted to like this soup but it was SO rich; too rich to call a soup.  I did follow the recipe to a tee so I'm not sure why the rave reviews.","Perfect.","Loved it easy to make and the taste was awesome","Very good soup, even using Better than Bouillon Not Beef (vegetarian).  A definite keeper!","Came home from a weekend away, after 6 hours in the car, thinking what could I make for dinner?  Something easy and good, but somewhat light.  I thought of this soup and starting making it at 6:30, then I saw the directions say that it takes over 4 hours to prepare.  I cut that down to a little over an hour.  I have an induction cook top and got the onions going at a higher temp, while stirring constantly.  I added a little brown sugar to sweeten them, they caramelized nicely, then I added the salt, pepper and paprika along with the flour - cooked while stirring for a bit, then added the broth and wine.  Simmer for 30 min.  Toasted some french bread in the broiler with olive oil and a little garlic.  Served with mozzarella cheese & parmesan cheese over the toasted bread - broiled.  Delicious!","Extremely delicious!  I love Famous Barr's French Onlon Soup and then they stopped making it.  I am happy this recipe came along.","IMHO, this is an ok soup (gravy), but not a true French Onion soup, hense the 2 stars. I followed the ingredient list as written, but altered the cooking technique just a little. First, I exactly halved ALL of the ingredients (in case I didn't like it) and secondly, I took a tip from another reviewer and mixed the flour, paprika,pepper and salt together and put that in with the onions after their cooking time and made a roux and then added the broth. I think the total cooking time for the onions, 3 1\/2 hours, is way too long, they were almost mush, and most of them disappeared into the liquid. I also thought that the paprika over-powered the onions, and gave the soup an off taste and an odd caramel color, which is why I added enough Kitchen Bouquet to try and offset that. It was more like an onion gravy than a soup. I thank you for posting, but I'll stick to my tried and true recipe.","This is a good, tasty soup -- but be advised -- it is not classic French Onion Soup (see Julia Child). I had never been to Barrs, so have no frame of reference. It's the paprika that makes it so different. Good, but different.","I can not believe that I have not rated this recipe. Being a STL girl since birth this recipe brings sweet memories, and that is all that is left now since Famous-Barr is now just a memory. So I am very glad that you posted this here, Bill. It is as close as I can come to the soup I remember having as a young girl with my Grandmother when we would go downtown. Thanks for posting it here so it can live on.","I made this delicious soup using my home made veal and beef short rib stock.  I carmalized the onions separately, since I was finishing my stock at the same time.  It is fantastic!  It reminded me of something I had in the south of France - great memories along lamb and chateau-du-pape.","I followed the recipe as is only making a half batch and added a T of brown sugar to the onions after they cooked for a while in lieu of caramel coloring. We liked the thicker consistency and flavors but either the pepper or paprika made it way too spicy. Next time I will add less of both or maybe no pepper and less paprika to see how that works. Great recipe though.","This is by far the BEST French onion soup you will EVER eat!  Worth every minute of cooking time!  Who ever gave this a bad review about 20 reviews from the top... unfortunately doesn&#039;t know her\/his way around the kitchen!  This soup is so easy and SO delicious!","I finally got around to making this yesterday, in spite of the fact that I grew up eating Famous-Barr&#039;s soups.  This is delicious, and very close to the original.  I did not thicken- and glad I didn&#039;t, this soup was perfect without it.  To add body without thickening with flour (which leaves a goopy, pasty consistency)....use just 2-3 short pulses with an immersion blender.  This will still leave chunks of onion, but will puree just slightly and break up the longer strings of onion.  You will end up with a silky textured, rich but still thin broth.  Add the bread and cheese, and the soup will have plenty of body.  &lt;br\/&gt;I also did not feel the need to add Kitchen Bouquet. &lt;br\/&gt;Next time I will reduce the paprika just slightly, for good balance with the onions.  Will definitely make this again and again.","Amazing! I am a serious soup lover and French onion is my absolute favorite. This recipe made enough for my husband and I to enjoy (with leftover) and wound up with enough to send half to our neighbors, whose daughter had just graduated high school. I sent the soup, slices of Swiss and smoked provolone slices, a simple tossed salad and a loaf of french bread. If not for the surplus, I would have sent only a handmade card with cash (they are incredible neighbors). Variation: I had no white wine (drank it all; it&#039;s summer!) so, I used the same measurement of vegetable stock with about five dashes of white wine vinegar as a substitution. It started to get a little thick for my taste so, I added an extra cup of beef stock after the final simmering stage, turned the heat off and let sit for 30 mins. The flavor and consistency was perfect at this point. I have had soup of the same, thicker consistency that sticking to the exact recipe yields and it was great but, not &quot;bullseye!&quot;. If I have my perfect French onion, it is a little soupier; that and necessity (substituting veggie stock\/ white wine vinegar) is the only reason I deviated from the recipe. I will be making this every week for lunches. I have been paying 4 bucks a bowl. I can make a whole stock pot full for that and change. Plus, I found it to be delicious enough to include in a food gift. Thank you so much for sharing. The long cook time is so worth the flavor payoff.","I followed this to the T. While I thought it to be OK, to me it&#039;s not worth all the work. I can get just as good or what I consider better with a lot less work.","Hate to disappoint everyone, but this is not the original Famous Barr&#039;s French Onion Soup Recipe. Living very close to St. Louis, I had a friend who worked downtown making the French Onion Soup.  It was a (2) day process to make, but well worth the time it took. I have the original recipe but promised my friend I would never give it out.","not a good recipe.....no butter...just sweat onions....add burgundy wine and fresh garlic cook untill wine gone....add BEEF stock...simmer and add sherry and brandy ....simmer and taste season","Thank you, I use to to eat at Famous Barr every time we visited my aunt in St. Louis. In 1984 I moved to St.Louis from Calif. and the first place I went was Famous Barr and left there with a job.I have tried for to many years to get this recipe with much failure. I wont try any one else&#039;s no one can compare and I only got disappointed so I stopped. I have waited 32 years for this I have Cancer and so will cook this ASAP again thank you if you stay with recipe dont change a thing you will never try another.","My memory of Famous-Barr Onion Soup is wonderful -- it was always good. I have found, however, that using only beef broth or stock can make the soup a little bitter. I make onion soup following an America's Test Kitchen which calls for only chicken broth. It is an extremely good soup!!","I really liked this! I made enough to freeze, and used as a base for veg beef soup. It's a keeper, thanks!","I finally made the time to make this afternoon. THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT! The family was impressed and our bellies happy. We will be making this again!","I am a fan of French Onion Soup and have wanted to make it at home for quite a while. I made this with a few tweaks and think it excellent. I cut Paprika in half based on a review I read here, figuring I could add more during simmer if my taste buds suggested it needed more. Also, based on comments here, I cut the flour to 1\/2 c. It is still just a bit thick for my liking, especially after soaking into the baguette. But thinning is pretty easy using that magic ingredient. During simmer tasting, I felt something was lacking. It was a bit bland. After reading other recipes to see what it might need, I settled on adding Worcestershire sauce and Thyme. I added 3 generous pinches of Thyme and started adding dashes of Worcestershire, probably about 15 dashes total, and they did the trick. Don't know if the Thyme did anything, but the Worcestershire did. I know some don't like it when you review a recipe you have tweaked. But hey, who doesn't take a recipe and make it their own by from time to time. I give it 4 stars as written, 5 as it turned out.","I used about 5 cups of browned onions to make my own versions. Used beef Better Than Bouillon concentrate to make my broth (love this stuff) and kept adding more of it till I had a salty, flavorful stock base. Did make a small batch of roux and added the broth to that, then stirred it back into the rest of the broth. A little wine was a nice touch. Good recipe to follow, and a good one to use as a base to add your own preferred seasonings and favorite products.","I recently lost my Momma. I have some very precious memories of feeling like we had won the lottery, simply because we ate french onion soup at Famous Bar. The last time will never forgeten, we went to Famous Bar far a facial and french onion soup and even the exact makeup that was used during the facial. Thank you Momma for creating such an amazing forever memory! The kind of memory that absolutely no one other than the 2 of us can understand. I luv and miss ya like crazy! THANK YOU FAMOUS BAR!!!!!!!","If you are trying to eat healthy, soup has got its neutrality to eat healthy. Ready to cook soup","The unpeeled onions refer to the total weight prior to peeling. 2 1\/2 lbs after peeling will be close to 2 lbs.","I grew up in the St Louis area and ate this soup at Famous Barr dozens of times. For years they had the recipe printed on a table tent on every table. Refrigerating overnight is absolutely crucial. Served it one time the same day and the paprika was way too strong. The same batch the next day was sublime. I use Better than Bouillon or Johnny's French onion soup concentrate rather than canned broth. Either makes it much better. I melted the cheese on the bread under the broiler and then add to the soup. Much easier to handle.","I downloaded this recipe in 2011, but never made it until today. Silly me, it was delicious! I only had a #3lb. bag of onions on hand, so I used that and 5 cans of beef broth. Also added Better than Bouillion with the flour\/broth mixture. It's just me and my husband, so I will freeze the remaining for another meal. Also, I thought it odd to simmer for 2 hours after adding the broth, but it really is one of the most important steps!

Carole's recipe isn't exactly like Sharon's and I need to note the differences so that I can continue to make the recipe I love as stated in my original review including Sharon's changes to the instructions. In my opinion these two recipes are different; however, this is food.com and I don't get to make that decision, as the food.com \"elves\" have merged these two recipes, hence my notes to self in the form of this revised review.  INGREDIENTS: ignore the 2 cups soybean flour, use 2 cups lentils versus 1 cup, and 5 tablespoon olive oil. DIRECTIONS: Step 3 - use blender;  Step 8 - place into 4 greased loaf pans; Step 9 - let rise until doubled in bulk and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour.Sharon's intro says, \"This bread will supply protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. Plus it tastes good! Prep time includes time for the dough to rise. Made during Bible times, this is a Middle Eastern bread.\" Next is my original review modified for the directions: Going into this I didn't realize it made 4 loaves! If I had I might have tried to scale it down a bit. So, drawing upon the strength of Ezekiel, I made it as directed! This also didn't fit my plans to use my KitchenAid mixer - too much volume! I had to make it by hand, which fortunately was therapeutic and cathartic. If you make it by hand because you don't have a commercial appliance, triple the estimated time it takes to make! Now that I've captured my thoughts on this, I can say that I give it 5 stars because IF you can put this together, the results don't disappoint. You may just have to use your brain on this one, and your heart! Thanks, Sharon123! Made for <b>Healthy Choices<\/b>.","I'm going to make it today.

I added a little sugar to the tops before baking and butter while they were warm.  Very delicious!","These are nice, BIG muffins and not too sweet.  Next time I may add a little orange or lemon zest.  Brown sugar & oatmeal sprinkled on top would be tasty too, but I'm baking for a diabetic!  I've made these several times already....it's a keeper!","After making some not so fantastic muffins(perhaps becuz I substituted whole-wheat flour for all of the recipes), this is the Best muffin recipe of all! The texture is v good though I'll add a bit of salt next time.","I was a little scared about doing muffins with only whole wheat flour but these were perfect!  I can't say anything bad about them!  They were super quick and super yummy.  When you add fruit you don't need a lot of sugar to make them taste great.  I doubled this recipe and it made 24 muffins.  I will definitely make them again.  I can feed them to my kids guilt free.","These muffins were quite tasty! Though these can't compete with a regular full fat, full sugar, white flour blueberry muffin, you certainly won't mind if you are a South Beach dieter like me, to have a great and healthy muffin like this one. It is not overly sweet and has great texture. I substituted Splenda for the honey, canola oil for the vegetable oil,added some freshly grated nutmeg,lemon zest and a dash of salt to add a little flavor. We really enjoyed these and will have them as an occasional treat! Thanks for sharing!","I thought these were wonderful.  My kids loved them too.  I didn't have honey so I used 1\/2 splenda and 1\/2 sugar.  Other then that I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you!","These are going to be a regular at my house! A healthy muffin that has nice texture and minimal sweetness, and with the benefit of whole wheat flour. I used canola oil and frozen wild blueberries. Perfect! I may try sprinkling with cinnamon sugar before baking for variety, but like them very much as is. Thanks, Carole Reu, for a great recipe!","Excellent!! I am so glad to find a recipe without sugar. The only weird thing was my blueberries sank to the bottom of the muffins...but taste was GREAT. I used whole egss and grapeseed oil for the oil.","I'll make these again.  I love how nutritious they are!  The muffin itself isn't very sweet, so it's perfect for my toddler who gobbled them up.  I sprinkled the muffins I planned to eat with cinnamon sugar as suggested.  I don't think I could have eaten them without that.    ","I was glad to find a 100% whole-wheat recipe, since we just got a flour mill recently.  A made a couple of small changes.  I added 1\/4 tsp salt, cut the honey in half and added 1\/4 cup brown sugar in its place.  My wife and kid thought they should be sweeter, but I loved them.  They rose quite a bit and were surprisingly fluffy.  I buttered them up while warm and enjoyed them with a nice glass of ice-cold milk.  YUM!","These are great.  As a vegan, I substitued the buttermilk with vanilla soy milk and the egg whites with egg white substitues and they turned out great!","I liked these a lot! I used 1\/4 cup honey & 1\/4 cup Splenda but next time I might use all Splenda. I also substituted the oil with 1\/3 cup lite cinnamon applesauce & while it worked all right, next time I might try the oil & see how they come out. I used fresh blueberries but next time I'm going to line the muffin cups with paper liners because the blueberries oozed out on some of the muffins! Baking time for me was only around 20 min. I actually got 17 muffins out of this, which was a nice surprise! Thanks so much for a healthy, whole wheat recipe.","I didn't really like these one too much, I think next time I will add more honey or sugar?? The thickness was aright though!","We thought these were excellent.  I made them as a snack for my daughter's preschool class.  I doubled the recipe and used half regular whole wheat and half white wheat flour.  I also used soy milk with some lemon juice added instead of buttermilk.  We thought these were not too dense or dry with a lovely blueberry flavor.  A really nice muffin.  ","These are wonderful! I'm glad I didn't add salt, this has enough flavor on it's own. I used fresh blueberries, and concocted buttermilk with skim and lemon juice. \r\nThis is going into my recipe box under favorites. \r\n","These muffins are really good.  I used buckwheat honey for the honey it called for and they tasted great.","They were a little dry, but very tasty.","Fantastic!  I am so glad you posted this recipe.  I used fresh strawberries instead of blueberries and skim milk because those were the items I had on hand.  The muffins were moist, had a very nice texture and the flavor was great.  I tend to shy away from baking with whole wheat because of the texture\/taste, but I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for sharing!","It's hard to believe an all-whole wheat flour muffin could be so moist and fluffy! I had almost 1\/2 cup of honey, so I made up the balance with molasses (about 1\/2 Tbsp). I added 1\/2 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients, based some of the other reviewers' suggestions. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients because I love the flavor. I said \"Oh wow\" when I bit into the first one. They're very flavorful, and healthier than your typical muffin. In my opinion, they taste better than ones made with white flour and sugar. I decided to check them after 20 minutes because 30 sounded long to me, and I'm really glad I did because they were just right. My oven does cook kind of hot, I think, but I would definitely keep an eye on these while they're baking!","these muffins are wonderful! i added cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture. then vanilla too. I also have made it with brown sugar instead of honey and then with the honey and prefer the brown sugar. i also made a stuestal topping of melted buter, flour and brown sugar and put it on the top before baking. YUM!","Makes Great Muffins!  I used 1TBSP of Margarine and the rest of the oil I subbed with Applesauce.  Also used 1\/4c. honey with 1\/4c. Splenda. 1 cup of fresh blueberries was way too much.  Topping off with a butter spray and a sprinkle of sugar isn't bad either.","I love this recipe and will use it regularly. Finally a muffin that is good for you and tastes good too. Very moist, not overly sweet. Thank you for sharing.","A winner! Much lighter and fluffier than I'd expected. Since we don't worry about cholesterol, I used whole eggs instead of egg whites. Also added a bit of salt and a dash of nutmeg, sprinkled a bit of sugar on top, and made nine muffins instead of 12 so they'd be nice and big. Will definitely make this one again.","Absolute winner of a recipe!  Amazing taste and texture, plus it's 100% WW.  I accidentally put in 1\/2 c. oil, and also due to personal preference, I did end up altering almost everything, but I still feel this recipe, as stated, will be wonderful.  For pref., I used whole eggs, brown sugar instead of honey, added 1\/2 t. salt and 1 t\/ vanilla, and was short 1\/4 c. blueberries, so added 1\/3 c. fresh cranberries.  For the buttermilk, I used Saco dried (5 T. plus 1 1\/4c. water.)  Because I accidentally added too much oil, I added extra flour and a bit of extra soda.  With the extra, I got 15 muffins, and baked them about 25 minutes.  I also sprinkled just a bit of sugar on the top.  We all loved them!  Next time, I may stick closer to the recipe, except use applesauce instead of oil, and for personal pref. I will probably still use brown sugar.  So, if anyone is reading this, and thinking \"whole wheat muffins - I just don't know...\"  do take a chance!  This is a teriffic recipe, no apologies about the whole grain, and it can also be flexible enough to accomodate some personal preferances.","I loved these muffins! I did use brown sugar b\/c I ran out of honey. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. Used half applesauce and half oil. And finally added some vanilla to the batter. They were very light and rose wonderfully in the oven. I wouldn't use paper liners again as they stuck quite a bit! Thanks for the recipe!","This was my first time making WW muffins.  These were really good.  I made them as written and sprinkled w\/ raw sugar.  I didn't expect my boys to like them but they ran in asking for more.","Loved muffins.  I did change flour to 1 cup pastry\r\nflour and 1 cup regular whole wheat flour. Created a cake like muffin which is delicious","I used two whole eggs, whole milk instead of buttermilk, and brown sugar instead of honey--that's what the pantry held! I also doubled the blueberries to two cups and used a pan that holds six double-sized muffins instead of 12 standard. Came out perfect in 33 minutes.","Yummy muffins! I cut the recipe in half, used whole milk and a whole egg.  DH is not fond of blueberries so I filled 3 muffins cups before folding 1\/4 cup berries into the remaining batter. Topped the plain muffins with cinnamon sugar.","just a little too 'healthy' tasting for me. The whole wheat flavor was very strong.  I even added some crumb topping, but that wasn't enough.","This is a good basic muffin recipe that tastes fairly good for being so healthy :D.  I doubled the recipe, used whole eggs and used coconut oil for the oil.  Next time I think I will use 1\/2 melted butter and 1\/2 coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  Thanks for sharing.","These were very tasty and soft they had a very healthy appeal to them, and delivered on taste!\nI made this recipe using applesauce instead of oil, half splenda and half sugar instead of honey (but I did add a little squeeze of honey too). I only had 2% milk so I used that with a splash of lemon juice. And I also used whole medium eggs. I sprinkled oats and a little brown sugar on top before baking. Cook time was about 25 minutes, but I baked only 6 at a time because I only had a small pan.","Love these muffins! I made two batches... One with the honey and one with half honey and half artificial sweetener, and both tasted terrific! I also used skim milk instead of buttermilk and 2 whole eggs instead of the whites. Bake time was closer to 25 to 30 minutes. Overall, the best healthy muffins I've ever tasted. Not too sweet, light and fluffy, and definitely not too dry. Thanks for sharing!","My husband made these, they were okay, but could use just a little more blueberry flavor.  They pretty much tasted like a bran muffin, which is just fine.  I believe he added a little wheat germ and flax seed meal too.  Next time we make them I may add a little bit more blueberries.  Overall they were pretty good.  We will make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!","Wonderful muffins! Did not have blueberries on hand so I chopped up some dried cranberries, pecans, little bit of apple and finely shredded coconut and one whole egg instead of two whites...other than the additions, followed the recipe exactly. So moist and delicious! Next time I might sub brown sugar for the honey to see what difference it makes. Once again, delicious and will making these often. Thanks for posting!","great muffin! The texture is nice both from the oven and after being in the fridge. I've been wolfing them down and it feels good for me :) I just used 1 whole egg (instead of 2 whites), accidentally increased the buttermilk to 1.5 cups (defrosted from previously frozen cubes - great way to store leftover buttermilk!), and stuck to 1\/2 cup honey. I was really thinking about adding 1\/4 cup brown sugar because some reviews said they're not sweet enough, but I thought it was perfect  - a hint of honey but not too sweet. My husband would want more sweetness though. I used 1+1\/4 cup of frozen wild blueberries, and that was more than enough. Spray the muffin liners to prevent sticking - a lot sticks when just out of the oven, tho it's better after refrigeration. I thought about adding salt & vanilla as other reviews mentioned, but I'm glad I stayed to the original ingredients for the first try.","These were good.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY the first time.  They muffins weren't quite sweet enough . . .  and I don't have a very big sweet tooth.  The second time I made them, I added a sprinkling of brown sugar on the top.  That was just the perfect amount of sweetness.  I love that they are healthy!!!  Thanks!","I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of regular. Used two whole eggs, 1\/4 C. honey and 1\/4 C. brown sugar, soymilk, and added 1\/2 t. salt and 1t. vanilla, as well as a mashed banana.\n\nThey came out so moist, soft and flavorful! thanks for the recipe!","These were very good muffins. I doubled the blueberries and they turned out perfect. They weren't as sweet as I expected them to be, so I might try adding more sugar or purchasing sweetened frozen blueberries (if possible). But, other than that they tasted very good. Thanks!!","I also substituted 1\/4 cup brown sugar, and they turned out great!   A nice healthy muffin for snacks.  Thank you.","Wonderful!! Not too sweet.  I used Buckwheat Pancake mix instead of whole wheat flour and added fresh pinapple chunks, lemon zest and a little cinnamon, OMG, these are the greatest!!  Kind of tastes like a bran muffin, but better, lighter, and less sweet.  I used 1\/4 c brown sugar and 1\/4 c honey.   I added more Buckwheat Pancake mix to make the the batter less runny, and more firm.  Perfect, love these muffins.","very good! i added some strawberries in with the blueberries, salt as suggested, and some brown sugar.  they were lovely - although the cook time is very long.  mine were overdone after 19 minutes, so definitely watch them...  thanks!","These are very good muffins, and I was surprised at how nice the texture was with 100% whole wheat (though I did use whole wheat pastry flour). I don't like muffins sweet and routinely cut back the sugar 25%, so if these weren't sweet enough for me (even with 3 tablespoons of raw sugar sprinkled on top), most people will want more sugar in these. I followed a lot of other reviewers and used brown sugar instead of honey, one egg, 1\/2 tsp salt, and added 1 tsp almond extract. For the reviewer whose blueberries sank, you can toss them with a tablespoon of the dry mixture and stir them at the end to prevent this. Mine were done baking at 19 minutes, but I was prepared for this, since a lot of people mentioned that (and I have never baked muffins longer than say 23 minutes). These were great muffins, especially for being all whole wheat, and I would definitely make them again -- with 2-4 more tablespoons of brown sugar. Thanks!","I used 3\/4 cup 2% milk and 1\/2 cup sour cream instead of the buttermilk, 1\/4 cup honey and 1\/4 cup brown sugar and one whole egg instead of two whites.  I also added 1\/4 cup of milled flaxseed to add some omega 3.  These were delicious with a little bit of trans-fat free margarine on top!  Definately recommend this recipe.","I made these muffins this morning to bring to the office today. I will update the \"star\" rating when I get home tonight after hearing what the girls think. Here are a few notes that I would like to mention: 1) I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil, 2) I only used about 1\/8 cup of honey because that is all that I had left. I did add 1\/2 cup packed light brown sugar to kind of made up for the missing honey, 3) I used frozen blueberries, 4) I sprinkled a \"pinch\" of wheat germ on the top of each muffin while cooking and 5) my bake time was exactly 28 minutes and my toothpick came out clean. I think that next time I will try 26 minutes instead. Thank you for a healthy muffin recipe! I put a picture up; I hope that you like it!  UPDATE;  Well, I'm home from the office with an EMPTY basket.  Lots of compliments.  I'm just bumming because I didn't even get one! :-( Thanks again for posting.","Awesome muffins!  Moist and full of flavor.  I did make 2 modifications - 1) replaced oil with unsweetened applesauce; and 2) added 1\/4 cup Splenda.   They maybe would have been fine without the Splenda, but I like my muffins sweeter.    I will make these again.","Great!  I added walnuts. 18 muffins it made for me :O)","I made these this morning, with just a few alterations, and they are almost gone already! (I only had one). These muffins have excellent flavor, and baked up to a nice peak if baked at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes. Thanks for another great recipe, Carole.","This is a phenominal blueberry muffin recipe!  My parents try to eat healthy but still like to have sweet treats.  They raved about these muffins.  I made some slight changes.  I added a small amount of brown sugar because I ran out of honey.  I also topped the muffins with a pinch of brown sugar, as was suggested.  It is important to toss the frozen (this tip may work for fresh as well) blueberries in 2TBS. of flour and let them rest for a few minutes before incorporating.  That way the blueberries will not run and turn the batter purple.  This recipe made more than 12 muffins.  My parents keep requesting that I make these again.  I will try different ingredients such as raisins and walnuts next time.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!  I know this is one that  I will be making over and over again.","The best whole wheat blueberry muffin recipe that I have made so far (and I have made quite a few). I had to make my own buttermilk with vinegar and it turned out great. I used whole white wheat flour and they were very fluffy. Next time I will add brown sugar to the tops before baking to sweeten them up a little. i will also add a 1\/4 tsp salt. Thanks for the great recipe!","Great muffins! I did not have buttermilk so I substituted plain yogurt mixed with 1\/4 cup of skim milk. I also added 1 tsp of lemon zest, whole eggs and used brown sugar instead of honey. Everyone loved them.","These are as delicious as they are good for you! The first time I made them as is, just substituting yogurt for buttermilk.  The second time I used 1\/3 c. of almond to replace 1\/3 c. of the flour, added orange zest, substituted apple sauce for oil, and substituted the butter milk for 1 c. greek yogurt and 1\/4 c. fresh orange juice.  Even better.","Great receipe. . .I got um alittle wet using too much yogurt. Should have brought them back into balance with more flour. (Used KA White Whole Wheat). Got lazy so I had Texas sized muffins with lots of blueberries on the bottom. Only a couple left so I'll be whipping more up today. Had trouble not eating a weeks worth out of the oven. Even Wifey ate one. . .she doesn't eat anything sweet. . .a meno thing. I take one in lunch to work daily. They freeze and reheat very well. Thanks alot.","I only gave 3 stars because the whole wheat didn't seem to work with the blueberries.  The muffin turned out well and pretty light overall.  They reminded me of corn muffins with blueberries.  I was pleased by the texture given the 100% whole wheat.  I think the grainy, hearty texture of wheat flour would have played better with a more dense fruit like raisins or dried cranberries or dried cherries.","I have been trying different muffin recipes recently and this is the worst one by far! The muffins were dense and chewy.  They also diddn't have any flavor.  I added chocolate chips instead of blueberries so that made them tast a little better.....bur not much!","this recipe was alright. after reading some of the reviews i tweaked it a little hopeing it wouldnt be so bland but alas it was still bland. they stuck to the muffin paper horribly, but that was probly my fault for using applesauce instead of oil. i also added chopped apples and cinnamon instead of blueberries. they will probly taste good warmed with butter spread on them with the changes i made. i would love to try and make these again and tweak it till i find the perfect flavor and sweetness without adding calories","I was not overjoyed about these, but they were very good.  I probably will not make them again.  The soda, surprisingly, is overpowering and I did find them a bit bland after they were baked.  The batter, on the other hand, was delicious.","Really good, especially for 100% whole wheat. Not heavy at all, and not too sweet.","Made as directed, but used 1\/2 brown sugar 1\/2 honey.  Though not as sweet as other recipes, they are very good as a healthy alternative.  Thanks for posting!","I thought these were great.  Had a normal muffin consistency.  I used yogurt and skim milk instead of buttermilk.  I also sprinkled brown sugar on top which I think these muffins need.  Instead of butter, we used honey as a spread.  They could be sweeter.","These are delicious.  I added a 1\/2 c. brown sugar, and 1\/2 t. salt.  Sprinkeld with sugar\/cinn mixture.  LOVE THEM!  And, we added 2x as many blueberries.","Moist and delicious!   Not overly sweet, really lets the flavor of the blueberries come through.","These muffins are great! I did make some adjustments per the other reviews. I used one whole egg, used brown sugar and increased it to about 3\/4 cup, added 1\/4 tsp. sea salt, and added about a tsp. of vanilla. I also sprinkled sugar in the raw on the tops of the muffins. I baked the muffins at 400 for about 23 minutes and they came out beautifully! They were big and puffy and tasted as good as they looked! Not to sweet and they had a nice fluffy texture. Next time I will try with only egg whites since that makes the muffins practically cholesterol free. These are a keeper! They taste great and are healthier then the average blueberry muffin. Thanks, Carole!","I also used 1\/4 c brown sugar in addition to 1\/4 c honey.  These muffins turned out great!!  I never thought wheat muffins could be so good!","Great recipe.  Muffins were moist and fluffy.  I usually have to make tons of substitutes as my family has an egg allergy.  I used my flaxseed mixture to sub for one egg, since other reviewers used one whole egg instead of 2 egg whites.  I also used brown sugar, and was our of buttermilk so used milk w\/ vinegar.  I sub'd blueberries with raisins.  Came out great.","I used agave syrup instead of honey and 1 T flaxseed a 3 T water instead of egg, and my flour was whole wheat pastry flour.  Made this way I felt these were really very yummy.  Next time I will sub some oil with applesauce. Oh I did add vanilla and orange extract too ( 1 tsp each)","Absolutely excellent! The men in my family seem to think they're not sweet enough but I think they're perfect.","I thought these muffins were great! I did make a few substitutions. I didn't have buttermilk, so used 1% and lemon juice as substitute. Instead of 2 egg whites used 1 whole egg. In place of the vegetable used 1\/3 C. plus 2 TBSP pureed pumkin (have too many cans in the pantry, need to use up and adds a little Vitamin A), did not have any honey so used agave nectar (1\/4 C.) and since some other reviewers had said these were not too sweet I added about 3 TBSP Splend Brown Sugar Blend into the mix. I did also add just a pinch of salt.  They came out nice and puffy and didn't fall. Yummy - will be making these over and over. Thank you!","Needs more sugar!! Otherwise, this is very good for a whole wheat muffin.  The consistency is light, not dense and it is quite moist.  As per other reviews, I used 1 whoe egg and a 1\/4 cup more blueberries. Also 1\/4 cup brown sugar, 1\/4 cup honey plust a tbsp of Splenda. This was NOT enough sugar.  I don't like things very sweet, but even for me, I would have easily added 1\/4 cup more of brown sugar. Still....very yummy and worth a try!","I have made this recipe every week since I found it. This is the best combo my husband and I love. \nAdd to the liquid: one tsp vanilla extract, a pinch of sea salt, 2 one week ripe bananas and add 1 tbsp of chopped walnuts in the batter once mixed together and sprinkling the top of each muffin with walnuts before baking. The bananas help add an element of sweetness.\n\nOn an unhealthy note I have also made a variation with one tsp vanilla extract, pinch of sea salt, 2 ripe bananas, 1\/4 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips (has to be mini) and 1\/3 cup of toasted coconut with a sprinkle of untoasted coconut to the top of the muffin before being baked\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6yumm.","I made this with my kids all in one bowl and it went together really well even with the modifications i made:  I used brown rice flour and corn starch instead of the whole wheat due to what I had on hand, one whole egg, plain milk and added lemon juice, flax and cinnamon. They came out beautifully after 23 minutes.  I do not think more sugar is needed but do think the banana and vanilla suggested by others would be an improvement... lemon zest would be nice too. Thanks for posting, We'll be making this again!","These are great muffins. Very moist and fluffy. I added 1 tsp of vanilla, a pinch of salt. I also used 1\/3 cup oil and 2 T applesauce. I thought they were plenty sweet, although I sprinkled half of them with cinnamon sugar before baking just in case. I haven't tried a cinnamon one yet, but I'm sure that they won't be over-sweet. This recipe is a keeper, for sure.","I was hoping for a whole wheat blueberry muffin that rivaled it's white flour counterpart.  My husband and I were disappointed, but the kids didn't care!  They gobbled them up.  I probably won't make this again, unless it's for the kids only.  Thanks anyway Carole Reu!","Excellent! I used my own home ground hard white winter wheat. The recipe turned out so good I made another with apples, nuts, and raisins right away. I increased the honey about half again as much as per other suggestions about sweetness. I actually think I could go a little less as I don't like things very sweet. Stayed with Tupelo Honey though instead of sugar as my husband is diabetic and it is the only honey suggested for diabetics.","For a whole wheat muffin these were nice and moist.  Mine only needed 25 minutes.","I made some modifications.  I used 1 cup of kefir, which is a sort of sour milk\/yogurt drink, two T of lemon juice and 1\/2 a cup of sour cream instead of buttermilk.  I also did 1\/2 and 1\/2 white and whole wheat flour, salt and added 1\/4 cup of ground flax\/sunflower seed\/pumpkin seed and goji berries.  I added some vanilla powder as well.  I thought these were great!  I love that they are healthy and not very sweet.  With a little jam or honey spread on they are perfect!  Thanks so much for the recipe :)","I used agave instead of honey and doubled my berries (used cranberries instead of blueberries). My husband even ate some! And he never ever eats anything whole wheat. These were great!","I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was just what I was looking for!  I had to make it dairy-free, so almond juice with 1 T. of lemon juice worked fine.  I had extra batter, so I made 12 muffins and a mini-loaf of bread.  I think the muffins were sweet enough, but a bit bland.  I&#039;ll try adding a couple tablespoons of vanilla extract next time.  These worked well with my frozen blueberries.  I feel good about eating this recipe with a meal or as a snack.  I also made using light olive oil.  Light, fluffy, and delicious!","Okay, we loved your recipe.  I liked that is healthier then most and my kids adored them.  But I have to say, I didn&#039;t use blueberries, I used chopped up peaches as I had a lot of them and didn&#039;t want them going bad.  They tasted great.  I will make this again with blueberries as that&#039;s our favorite muffin flavor, but subbed in this one time.  I think any fruit would go nicely with these muffins.  thank you so much for sharing with us.  Keeper file","Too bland. Tasted like the &quot;healthy stuff&quot;.

I tried this recipe and it was...well, just like Moms. I know why she didn't make it more often ~ we'd have each weighed about 400bls! Anyway, my one correction is that if you pre-heat the oven before you proof the yeast, it will be on for about 1.5 hours or more before you actually need it. Preheating it when the dough is resting for the final 30 min is more than enough.

I reduced the dill to 4 tsp. of dried; I LOVE dill, but have to go a little easier on it for my husband's tastes.  I added several cloves of sliced garlic (a favorite add-in of mine) and omitted the pepper (I don't like black pepper).  The only thing was that it only took 35 minutes to be very thoroughly done, so I'd check it more carefully next time to make sure I'm not over-cooking.","This bread was delicious. I also used 6 teaspoons of dried dill. This bread has a beauriful color and the texture was perfect. I sliced it and put egg salad in it. Yummy!!.

I baked this tonight, and it is VERY GOOD!  I made open egg salad sandwiches using this recipe, and my husband wants to have it again tomorrow night.  THANK YOU!!","An excellent recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 50\/50 plain yogurt and milk. Worked wonderful but I did increase the liquid to 2 cups. A nice moist bread with great flavor. A definite winner.","I really love this bread-one of the best dill breads I have made!!! I love the tang the buttermilk adds to the flavors. I used 4 tsp. dried dill (did not have any fresh). I made 2 loaves and added minced garlic to one. Both loaves went to making sandwiches-tunafish, chicken salad, honey ham, and smoked turkey---all were delicious!!! Thank you so much for a great recipe!!! Update: had leftovers from last loaf so I made croutons-and they are wonderful, too!!!","This is yummy! I added half a cup of shredded sharp cheddar.

Having said that - it is the best I have found so far.  I would say to roast the eggplant just a little longer for that smokey flavor I love. I did 45 minutes and think 50 - 55 minutes may be better (of course it depends on the size of the eggplant).  Also, just a little less lemon juice and tahini.  I used 3 cloves of garlic and it was perfect.  Salt? about 1 tsp. Also, I put the olive oil directly in rather than use it as a topping.  Overall, this recipe is the best I have found.","This recipe was wonderful. We cooked our eggplant on the grill. Our only change was we didn't add olive oil or scallions. There was enough oil for me with the tahini. Thank you for sharing this.","Just the best - that mayo trick mentioned reminded me of a Greek lady who added an egg yolk & a bit of heavy cream to hers.

I added some Worcestershire, but after I served my DH--I took it back and added more Worcestershire.  I also think the wine I used was too cheap, because it seemed to have a very strong influence on the dish; I'm thinking a dry sherry would be better.

Since I didn't have applesauce to replace some of the oil, I just decreased it by 1\/4 cup (cake is still very moist).

Both times it came out great! Gone before it cools in this house. Neighbors keep asking me to make more. This will definitely be a Christmas gift this year.","Delicious!  I poured the batter into 5 mini loaf pans.  2 without nuts and 3 with walnuts.  My family loved the ones without the nuts.

Other than that, I made it exactly as directed & it was AWESOME! Wish I had enough eggs to make 2 loaves!","So good, I used half whole wheat and half white flour.  I was skeptical of the batter once it was all mixed, it seemed really really thick, and when the apples went in I thought it was way too many apples but I kept with the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  I don't even think I'll make banana bread again unless I have to, this was so good.  I did use some sweet apple sprinkle from pampered chef on top too.","I didn't change anything and it was fantastic.

Like another reviewer, I didn't think there was enough coating for my 2 chicken breasts but there was plenty - probably enough for another two.","This recipe was made for mine and SO's dinner on 4\/21\/08.I used two flattened boneless chicken breasts.And the only thing that was cut in half in the recipe besides the chicken, was the paprika.

I used 14oz Gimme Lean rather than real beef, but can imagine that its even better with beef, will try that next time.  Also added a little more sauce because I thought it was too dry but that could be because I didn't use beef.  I really liked this alot.  If you like this, check out a diff variation of low carb lasagna recipe #43576, using spinach instead of zucchini's.","Wow this was good! I have been on the south beach diet & was looking for something like my lasagna recipe.  i used ricotta & a can of tomato sauce, and also threw in some mushrooms.  I will have to make this again soon! Thanks for sharing.","My sweetie couldn't say enough good things about this! The sauce was a bit too thick so I added 3 T. of tomato sauce and 8 mushrooms, sliced. We LOVE cheese so I used about 1 1\/2 cups, shredded Mozzarella (1\/2 lb), as follows: I used more Mozza cheese than called for in the cottage cheese mixture, and put some on top of the zucchini prior to putting it in the oven. The rest of the cheese was used on top at the 10-minute marker. This is an excellent recipe and the timing of the baking stages is bang on! Next time, I'm going to add spinach to the cottage cheese mixture - seems a natural!","This is such a good recipe that it lasted me 3 servings, not 4.  I substituted part-skim ricotta for the cottage cheese.","The whole family loved this recipe! It tastes better than regular lasanga because there's less cheese and no pasta. It did seem a bit watery when I first took it out of the oven, but after cooling for 10 minutes it was fine. This is definitely a keeper, and a great way to use up all that zucchini from our garden! :)","This recipe was very easy to make.  I added a can of mushroom pieces to the meat mixture as well.  It was delicious!","Delish! The sauce was thick and rich, just the way I like it. Next time I will double the recipe because it made only 3 servings for us. I cut the zucchini length-wise to look like lasagna noodles. This recipe is a keeper, thanks!","Excellent!  I'm on South Beach (so I omitted the flour) and this really satisfied craving for Italian food.  I did make some adjustments to what I had on hand:  I used peeled, uncooked,  1\/2 inch-diced eggplant instead of zucchini.  I didn't have tomato paste and I used a 14 oz can of well drained Italian flavored diced tomatoes instead of diced fresh one.  For the first layer of cheese, I used shredded mozzarella but used a shredded 6 blend Italian cheeses for the 2nd cheese topping.  Very filling and delicious; thanks for posting!  A new weekly dish to add to my SBD meal rotation!","This recipe cured my craving for pasta--without eating pasta! I added mushrooms and used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Also, I added some black olives.  Next time, I think I'm going to use eggplant instead of zukes and double the recipe.  A keeper with us.","I wish I could give this more than five stars...and I wish I had doubled the recipe so I would have more leftovers.  BTW, pre-broiled slices of eggplant works well paired with the zucchini in this recipe.  Also, we used cottage and ricotta cheese.  YUMMY.  I haven't had a meal this good in a while...and THAT is saying something. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It is definately going in my tried and true recipe book.  ","This dish is unbelievable!  I never expected it to taste as wonderful as it did.  My husband loved it and took the leftovers to work the next day for lunch.  I followed some other reviewers advice of using ricotta cheese with the cottage, also adding black olives.  I also used ground turkey in place of the hamburger.  Yummy!!","This was really wonderful.  I doubled this recipe, used 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of paste and tomatoes, also added pasta, yes I'm guilty. I left out the water and flour.  The rest was according to the recipe.  It had great flavors and texture with the zucchini. Thanks.","Excellent substitute for those heavy lasagna noodles!  Low carbers loved this one when I served it at a family dinner.  Great to have anytime!  Thanks for sharing it!","The 2005 zucchini onslaught has begun and this was a delactable way to put that summer squash to good use.  I made a couple of substitutions.  Not in a meat mood so I used Morningstar Farms crumbles in lieu of the ground beef. Also, I used non-fat cottage cheese and mozzarella. Yes, a bunch of people are reading this and going \"ewww\" but I've been on WW Core for a year and have developed a taste for the stuff.  The dish was wonderful - rich in taste and flavor but light enough to not give you that sinking heavy feeling that you get with a traditional lasagna.  The sauce is so good, I'm planning to make it again soon just as a basic pasta topping. The 10 minute sitting time was crucial as the lasagna firms up quite a bit.  Thanks Marg.","This was fabulous.  I made a double batch because I had some abnormally large zucchinis to use, and it was wonderful.  My son said, \"it's great, you can hardly taste the zucchini\".  This one's definitely a keeper.","Yum!  Thanks for a great solution to the remaining half of \"The Zucchini That Ate Chicago\" (started out at 5.5 lbs, and you can only make SO much zucchini bread (smile)).  I used a full pound of ground beef, added a small can each of drained black olives, sliced mushrooms, and about 1\/2 as much more of the herbs (had fresh basil & oregano in the garden). Used one small can fire-roasted chopped tomatoes, plus juice, a full 1\/2 lb. mozzarella and add 1\/2 cup ricotta and 1\/2 cup parmesan.  Coated zucchini in seasoned flour before frying.  YUMMO!  Quite a hit - and so much lighter feeling than with pasta.","Yep...  I agree with all the other ratings.  This is a delicious recipe.  Thank you for sharing!","Pretty good! I had double of everything except the cheese so mine was a bit more sauce and meat.  I used a can of tomato sauce instead of the fresh tomatoes and the sauce still came out quite good, just needed to cook a little longer for the liquid to evaporate.  Next time I might use both fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce.\r\nThanks!","This is a great recipe and as I only had a 1 lb package of ground sirloin, I decided to double the recipe.  I added some mushrooms and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  The best part of it is that you can mix and match vegetables.  I think next time I'll add bell peppers as well.","We loved this. I made it without any meat and with crushed tomatoes which created a lovely sauce. Even my four year old was excited when she saw this and my husband said he preferred it to regular lasagna because it was lighter without the noodles.","This was AMAZING and totally rocks the house!!!  Definitely double this recipe - you'll regret it if you don't!!!  Substituted 1\/2 bottle spaghetti sauce and 1 can chopped tomatoes for tomatoe paste and chopped tomatoes.  My husband doesn't eat carbs and I love carbs so we have to find compromises and this is our new favorite - I didn't even miss the noodles (and did I mention that I LOVE noodles?)!","This was surprisingly very  good!  I used only ricotta cheese because I had no cottage cheese and I also crumbled some tofu into it to make it more nutritous.  Next time, I will try the eggplant like the others suggested. Also to  make it easier next time I will just use spaghetti sauce rather than making my own sauce.  I used one layer of ground turkey on bottom, then zucchini, then cheese mixture, zucchini, and then mozarella cheese and used a 9 x 13 dish.","All I can say is YUMMY!!! My kids who don't like zucchini loved it.  I prefer this over regular lasagna...my hubby said he liked it alot but would not go that far. He is a lasagna lover.","This is fabulous!  I am trying to cut fat and carbs, and this fit the bill.  I miss pasta, and this is very close to it.  I used ground sirloin to lower the fat content and used green onions since regular onions are banned on my diet.  This was not difficult to make...I will make it again. Thanks for a great recipe!   ","All I can say is \"WOW\".  This was wonderful.  Followed the recipe, but instead of fresh tomatoes, used one can of diced tomatoes and 1\/2 jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste.  This is a keeper!!","This is a fine way to use fresh zucchini & herbs straight from the garden. I made two substitutions to cover ingredients I didn't have on hand. First, I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Second, I didn't have ground beef, so I used 8 oz. (weighed after baking) of Asian Style Savory Baked Tofu (#81284). I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but the flavors of the marinated, baked tofu worked very well in the zucchini lasagna. We loved this one, and I'll be making a double batch next week.","OH my word, this was soooooo GOOD! I had to make quite a few adaptions\/substitutions, though. I used a can of spaghetti sauce instead of making the sauce as indicated. I also shredded the zucchini (I have an old-fashioned grater that makes 1\/2 wide shreds). I used an entire large zucchini that got overgrown in the garden. I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. It was a bit runny, so next time I think I would put a bit of flour in with the zucchini shreds. I also microwaved the shreds instead of boiling them. I would also put some crushed garlic in with it while it cooks. All in all, this is a great recipe and will be a summer staple on our dining table.","I loved this!  I too used bottled sauce and, instead of ground beef, used cooked vegetarian sausage (that I had already cooked up with onions).  I also used low fat ricotta instead of the cottage cheese as I finished off the cottage cheese last night!  While the kids were only so-so about this, they are not huge lasagna fans.  Dh and I loved it.  It was easy to put together (my 4 year old and I put it together while dh and my 6 year old were at karate) and I love getting the extra servings of veggies in!","Oh my God....I have died and gone to Nirvana! This was wonderful and I can't wait to try this out on company. I used modifications as one of the members had suggested with mushrooms, olives and ground turkey. ","I absolutely loved this recipe. I'm a vegetarian so I left out the meat but it was excellent! Will definitely make again. supposed to cook the zucchini. I ended up steaming it, ","What an awesome recipe.If you are looking for a low carb meal this is one you should definitely try.\r\nMy 6 yr. old  daughter just loved it. We used yellow zucchini from our garden instead of green, and it was fabulous. This dish is also very easy to make. Thank you so much for this great recipe.","This was excellent!! I used 1 lb. ground turkey instead of beef and a can of drained stewed tomatoes instead of fresh and it came out delicious. I also used way more garlic than it called for.","Very good, except that I think, I will have to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage. But overall it was tasty! Thanks for the recipe\r\n","This was great and easy to make; a good one to make ahead of time. I put it in the fridge in the afternoon so all I had to do was pop it in the oven in the evening. I assume the cottage cheese was probably suggested to keep this a low-fat meal, but I used fat-free ricotta to keep my calories down and still get the Italian taste of ricotta. I also doubled the meat portions--because my boyfriend is a meat head...and we love us some meat.","This was great! My hubby is South Beachin' it and he was really craving some Italian food. This satisfied his craving- he absolutely loved it! I used a little more meat than called for in the recipe (about 3\/4 lb), omitted the flour (so it's SB friendly), and I subbed a can of low sodium diced tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes (just b\/c I didn't have any on hand). I also added some mushrooms and black olives to the meat mixture. This recipe made four servings for us and we have made it twice in the last week! Thanks again!","I cut the recipe in half since i knew it would only be me and my mom eating it (picky brothers don't know what's good). I really really REALLY liked it and it was soo simple. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because i prefer it.  This is definitely a new favorite!","This was really good.  Even my husband and in-laws who aren't south-beaching-it loved it.  I did feel like I needed more zucchini than it called for but that was no big deal.  YUMMY!","This was really good.  Great way to use up all the zucchini that people are giving me!","This was great! I made a vegetarian version, without the beef, but it still tasted GREAT! It would probably be even better with the beef, which is hard to imagine. I had never tried cottage cheese in a lasagna, either, but it works so well in this recipe!  This is a great one or Phase I folks like me -- thanks for sharing!","This turned out good! I made one serving-used about 10 slices of zucchini. I used my own marinara sauce & for a kick, chopped up 4 slices turkey pepperoni into the mixture! I used about 1\/4 cup reduced fat cheese, omitted the flour & added some seasonings to the marinara sauce. I also used lean ground turkey. Very easy, and very fun to mess around with! Didn't even miss the noodles! Thanks for sharing this.","This is great-I only changed from lean beef to spicy italian sausage for a little \"kick\" and it was a big hit with the family!  Thanks for posting!","this is terrific!  I was a little uncertain - how can you play with the classic flavor of lasagna?  but you can, and it is really delicious!  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I used an \"ice cube size\" of homemade pesto instead of the other spices.  And nonfat ricotta instead of the cottage cheese.  I also sliced a few tomatoes for on top of the lasagna and sprinkled just a small amount of mozz over that.  Thanks for the post!  I will make this again!","Very, Very good!  I made it exactly like the recipe and this satisfied our craving for pasta and wasn't heavy.  Very tasty.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 pan.  Oh yes, I also topped it with a layer of sliced tomatoes lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese. \r\n\r\nI did salt the meat sauce while cooking which brought out the flavor more and lightly seasoned the zucchini slices with salt and pepper. Like another reviewer said, I sliced the zucchini lengthwise to have more of the appearance of noodles.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I loved it and will enjoy it as part of our regular meals.  Thanks so much!","wonderful! i didnt use the cottage cheese, instead i used reduced fat ricotta and it turned out great! thanks","I loved it. I will double the recipe next time.","This is a great recipe that even my kids love.  The couple things I do differently though is for one, I do no cook the zucchini first.  I find it gets over cooked while baking.  And the other thing is that I also use ricotta instead of cottage cheese. To me, the cottage cheese tends to make any lasagna too watery.  It's definitely all personal preference though!  I've also added fresh spinach in a couple layers and my kids STILL love it.  Great way to get vegetables into them!","Very worthwhile, hearty, and tastey!  I used ground round (soy protein) and also added a layer of spinach.   I also used about 3 cups of tomato sauce instead of the paste and water.  I also didn't cook the zucchini prior because it cooks enough when baked.  Everyone will be impressed!","I am keeping this one! I did not pre-cook the zucchini as suggested by some other reviewers, this was a mistake! All in my family say they loved it but I should have followed the recipe and pre-cooked it. I did add pre-cooked eggplant which was also a great suggestion alos of several of the reviewers! Doubled or more the garlic which I always do. Thanks for  the recipe.","This was most lip smacking. My husband does that when he really likes something. The only thing I did differently, was to grill the zucchini, not pre-cook it. :)","Very good!","This made a very yummy dinner last night! Marg is right, the sauce is very mild - I wish I had added red pepper flakes like I had planned (I forgot!), but it was still great. My DS wasn't home but I do think he would have enjoyed it too. I used fat free cottage cheese and 3 ounces of shredded cheese (a combination of fat free cheddar and lowfat mozzarella) and felt that it was plenty. I plan to make again, thanks!","This recipe is an awesome addition to the low-carb repertoire! We used the fat-free ricotta, low-fat mozzarella, and, um, five cloves of garlic. We liked it so much that it was hard for DH and I to make it stretch to four servings :-D Thanks!","This recipe was good. I did double the meat and added more tomatoes. I would have rated it with 5 stars, but my husband were not totally crazy about missing the noodles. I know it is suppose to be healthier, but I will probably add in noodles next time. Thank you for the great ideas, though.","This was great.  I doubled it and used half ground beef and half sausage. Didn't bother cooking the zucchini first. All of my guests loved it so much I now have no leftovers.","We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used more cheese and ground beef as you suggested.  I sliced my zucchini into disks, then later noticed your photo (lengthwise slices) -- I think that would be great, and I'll try that next time.  This is a great way to use zucchini (and get DH to eat more veggies).","WOW...this is really delicious. I added more garlic and meat and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of cut up tomatoes. I needed to add more water because the mix was too thick. But  it was SSSOOO good. My family loved it. Definitely slice the zucchini lengthwise. It's easier to layer over the mixture. Plan to make this often. Better than using noodles and much healthier!","This was a good way to use up some zucchini. I forgot to add the flour to the filling so it was a little watery. Very good Italian dinner.","I cooked up sliced mushrooms in place of the meat to make it vegetarian, added extra garlic and used canned tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  It still turned out good! Thanks so much for another a good recipe to use up zuchini in the summer","This was SOOOO tasty! There is no way it's only 262 calories per serving, because it taste's WAY too good! lol! I used zucchini and summer squash (because I had an overabundance of squash), I added a can of garlic, basil & oregano tomatoes instead of fresh cut up tomatoes,  and I added a can of mushrooms. It was great! Even my 5 year gave it 2 thumbs up! It's a keeper. This will become a staple in my home.","This was great! My husband, who doesn't like zucchini, was very skeptical, but he liked it. I am vegetarian so I substituted the ground beef with 1 c TVP reconstituted with 1 c boiling broth. Also, I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added a green pepper as I had it on hand. Thanks.","Wonderful recipe! Tasted just like a good traditional lasagna. You don't even miss the lasagna noodles. I sliced the zucchini lengthwise and about 1\/4\" thick to give the effect of \"faux\" noodles.","This is awesome!!  WOW!  It is healthy, reasonably easy and delicious!  I added a little red pepper but otherwise was true to the recipe.  I will make this again and again and again.  Thanks Marg....","I used lowfat ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and added 8oz of mushrooms to 1lb ground beef.  It was delicious!!  It is healthy, yet satisfying.","Super easy and I got my 3 and 10 year olds to eat it with no problem.  I did thin the cheese and egg mixture with milk as it was to thick to spread. A+ in my book!","Made this for a diabetic dinner guest. My changes: 1 lb. ground beef (DEFINITELY use at least a full pound of meat), substituted approx. 1\/2 jar of pasta sauce for the sauce ingredients (tomatoes through pepper), and added more ricotta. Used 3 large zucchini, and I felt like I could have even used another. 2 may be too little. Overall it tasted very nice, flavorful (depending on what sauce\/spices you use) and set up nicely after standing for 10 minutes.","Terrific way to use zucchini.  My sister LOVES this dish!","My family liked this healthier version of lasagne. Since I had one large, uneven zucchini, I sliced it into circles instead of lengthwise slices, which I steamed for a few minutes. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, an Italian cheese blend and increased the herbs and spices for my tastes. Great light lasagne with as much flavour as the traditional version!","Wonderful recipe!  As an idea starter.  I didn't follow all the directions but shortened the job greatly.  I pan fried ground turkey and used light vegitarian prepared sauce.  Then whizzed the cheeses, I used 1\/2 ricotta and Cottage with the mozzarella in my food processor and added a bit of fresh parsley.  Blanched the long sliced zuchs and layered.  Quick and easy.","I loved this recipe but I suggest using 6 zucchini.  I sliced each zucchini into 4 slices lenghwise, brushed slices with olive oil and broiled them to bring out the sweet flavor.  I also broiled the slices of 2 eggplant (which were 1st salted, sat on paper towels for 20mins, then rinsed - this pulls out any bitterness from the dark seeds)  This quantity and combo of veggies really worked and gave the lasagna nice bulk and height. Wonderful Marg!","My mom has been sending me sacks of GIANT zucchinis every week, and they slice up beautifully for this recipe.  My low-carb husband demands more meat, so in addition to the 1\/2 lb ground beef i took 3 fat spicy italian sausages out of their casings and mixed them with the meat.  My mom also gave me lots of fresh basil which really adds that lasagna flavor.  I cant wait to try this with more veggies!  Thanks!!","Excellent lasagna. You don't even miss the noodles!","I made a lasagna with eggplant, so I had to try this one too.  Guess What?  This one is better! Not to mention the fact that it is good for you, and so low in calories and carbs!","This was great really tasty!!","We loved this recipe!  It's not like a dish that's trying to cover up the fact that there are no noodles.  It's a dish that stands on it's own.  Didn't miss the noddles, didn't even think about them!  \r\n\r\nI coated the zucchini with some olive oil and broiled them until tender and brown instead of boiling them.  We made this for Sunday lunch, and ate the rest for dinner that night.  Now it's all gone and I'll have to make a second batch!","Another winner - thank you Marg.  I, too, upped the meat to one pound, and used a pack of mixed grilled zucchini and eggplant (you can get it at Trader Joe's and it's delightful, cooked with olive oil).  So husband had a few bites and announced:  I LIKE THIS!  Hey, after 14 years of marriage when he says it like that, it's a five star recipe.  I doubled the garlic and used whole milk ricotta, just so you know.  Delicioso!  JT","Very delicious. Don't laugh but I forgot to put the tomatoe paste miture with the meat and cook- I actually put the 8 ingredients in the microwave to hurry it along as I was cooking the meat and onions and before I knew it I was layering as directed , put in the oven. Let's just say I topped it with the tomatoe mixture and cooked as usual. \r\nI sauteed my zucchini ( in Olive Oil) and I used more then stated but no need to drain. I also used crushed red pepper instead of black pepper. I didn't have an excess of liquid at all- never a need to cook the tomatoe paste mix either. A very forgiving recipe and absolutely wonderful.\r\nThanks for posting.","I was hesitant at first to make this for my family (my brother isnt exactly a fan of low carb aka no pasta) but he went back for seconds! I followed the recipe to a T, but doubled it and used both ricotta and cottage cheese. I think i would use less water as it came out a bit runny and flavor the beef. Thanks for sharing, will make again soon!","I loved this lasagne! I wouldn't change it a bit. But hubby thought it was a little bland, so we're comprimising with a 4star rating.\n\nI used 3 zucchini's and a large eggplant. I doubled everything else except the meat, added a bunch of sliced mushrooms, and used a large can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh ones (no time to dice). I also used ricotta cheese and marble cheese. Oh, and I forgot to add the water, but it was perfect without. Next time I'll just add a little more of the spices and maybe some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch for hubby. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!","yummy bizness!","This is one of those recipes where you really make it your own. I doubt I would have liked it so much if I followed the recipe to a T- especially the cottage cheese part (not a fan!). I took some tips from other chefs and made some modifications. Used fresh basil, fresh thyme, low fat ricotta & mozzarella, ground sirloin, and grilled eggplant as the \"noodle.\" I also doubled on the garlic and used some to saute along with the onions & beef. I hardly cook meat without seasoning so I seasoned the meat with Adobo & black pepper before cooking it. I think it's important to season to your tastes. Since the beefy sauce is what really makes the meal, taste as you go along before baking it. I added ground cayenne and some more dry Italian seasoning to get the beefy sauce to the right spice for my tastes. I like how the recipe called for fresh tomatoes because using canned might have been too salty. It just had a fresher taste that way. I even topped with red pepper flakes when it was done (I like spice!). Next time I make it, I'll try it with zucchini. Oh I almost forgot! Definitely use the full 1lb of beef for the 4 servings. Thanks for a great recipe!","I really liked this recipe.  I am a carb-lover, but I was satisfied with this meal, unlike most low carb things which I need a piece a bread or some pasta or rice with it.  I pretty much followed the recipe, other than adding an extra tomato because cottage cheese here is mainly curds (the Germans eat it on bread so it can't be runny) so I thought that would help it from drying out and adding some cayenne pepper instead of normal pepper.  Next time, I'll give it a try with eggplant, for a bit of change.  Either way, it will be made again. :)","I enjoyed this simple recipe enough and I'm certain I will make it again but I think it definitely needs a little tweaking in the flavor. It was very mild. I think more garlic and some Parmesan cheese would be helpful.","This was so good I decided to leave my 1st review! I added a little extra cheese & used cottage cheese the 1st time I made it & it worked out really good. The 2nd time I used ricotta...i think the cottage chz was lighter & tasted better. Definately going to make again & again!!","This was pretty tasty. My boyfriend, who is not a zucchini fan, really enjoyed this dish. I used 2 medium\/large zucchini and 1 eggplant and to fit a casserole dish, could have easily doubled this to accommodate the casserole size and meat sauce.  I used ground up Seitan for the meat and used extra mozzarella and a little fresh grated Parmesan before serving.  Thanks for posting.  I will make this one again.","Fabulous!  Made this a few weeks ago and it was SOOO  good!  My boyfriend, the pasta lover,  made a face when I told him it was low carb...  Then after dinner he said it was the best lasagna he ever had!!  Amazing.  Im trying it again tonight with ground chicken!  Hope its as good!","My mother and I tried this tonight, it turned out awesome! Also my father who is definitely not a low carb'er loved it! I give it five stars for sure and we'll probably be using this recipe once a week!","I have made lasagna with zucchini instead of meat, but never thought to use it instead of the noodles.  This tasted great, but didn't really hold together too well.  I think it should have stood for a little while longer (maybe 20 minutes) because the leftovers I was putting into the fridge held together nicely.  I probably will make it again :-)","This was great!  I like it much better than lasagne with noodles!  The first time I made it according to the recipe which was wonderful.  The second time I made it, I actually just added half a jar of spaghetti sauce to the browned beef\/onion\/garlic mix.  Thanks for posting!","Good but not fantastic. (I do like my pasta!) I broiled the zucchini a bit before layering the lasagna- I think it needs it.","WOW!!!  Best lasagna ever.  I made it last week and my family is asking for it again tonight!  The zucchini is an awesome substitute for noodles and one of us is severely allergic to onions and this recipe worked out great!  BRAVO!!!!!","We really liked this. Since I have to incorporate carbs into my diet I did put some of the no bake lasagne noodles in the layers. I omitted the riccotta\/egg mixture because my husband doesn't like it. Plus I used the tomato mixture from Penne Pasta with Tomatoes and Cheese since it was left over from earlier in the week. Even though I added things, we LOVED it!","With zucchini overflowing in my garden, this looked so tempting that I just had to make it!  This is the best Zucchini Lasagna I have ever made or had anywhere, and that's a compliment!","Very, very good! I used lowfat ground turkey, extra garlic and spices..YUM! I have to also say that you do not miss the pasta at. Use a mandoline slicer for uniform and thinner slices that seem even more like pasta!! So good!","I would probably add a little sugar to the meat sauce (unless you are on the low carb). I like my sauce to have a hint of sweetness. Otherwise, very easy and good.","GREAT!  This was a ten star recipe.  I used 1 lb of italian seasoned Honeysuckle white ground turkey, but also added the spices it called for.  I also used a little more tomato paste and cheese since I had a lot of meat.  It was so good, and I think I like it better than noodle lasagna.","Fantastic!  Being Italian and being on low card lifestyle, pasta is what I miss most of all.  The recipe is so easy and delicious.  When slicing the Zucchini I kept the cutting board at an angle over the sink and the excess moisture drains off the Zucchini.  I opted for Ricotta cheese since I cannot stand cottage cheese.  A word to low-carbers:  Whole Milk Ricotta cheese has less carbs than the other ones.  When I came to the final step of adding the top portion of cheese, I added a light sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on the top as well.  It browned very nicely.  I used 1\/2 lb of beef and for a variation next time will make it a cheese lasagna (minus beef).","Loved this - made it with broiled zucchini but micro would have been easier.  Used the 1 lb ground beef plus ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Next time I'd make a double batch so I have more than one serving leftover!  I also agree to double or triple the garlic.  Yum!","Using low fat cheeses, this is quite healthy, and really delicious and filling!  5 stars most definately!","Absolutely wonderful! I loved this and my husband loved it and my 2 year old as well. I used low fat ricotta and I used lean ground turkey. Also, I used jarred spaghetti sauce and added tomato paste to it to make it thicker and I did add the herbs you listed.. I tried a recipe like this in the past but it was nowhere near this good! This one is well put together and very yummy!! I've never made lasagna with noodles, and I never will, Thank you!!","I was recently put on a \"yeast free\" diet and lamenting my loss of lasagna... until I found this!! It was amazing, I didn't even miss the noodles. And my picky husband ate it up. It was enough for 2, plus some for lunch the next day. Thanks for a great recipe.","I am on a low carb diet and found this ..my hubby made it for me tonight for dinner.. used 1 lb ground beef, 2 garlic, 3 zuchinni and 8 oz mozz and the ricotta.. YUMMY!!","We are Italian and don't mess with our Lasagna, but being that we have been Low Carbing and my neighbor gave me 10 lbs of Zucchini, I have been searching for ways to use it. I made this Lasagna this week and it was wonderful. I didn't even miss the pasta. My husband also loved it. I did use Ricotta cheese because my mother used Cottage cheese once as a child and we hated it and it stuck with me, and it can curl. I also use 1 lb of ground beef and chopped up two hot sausages. Added extra on all the spices and garlic, husband loves garlic. There is so much you can do to this receipe. We had leftovers the day after and it was even better. Will make again, thanks for sharing.","Yum! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and substituted TVP for beef. Turned out really well if a bit messy.","My husbsband loves this! I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 pan to make enough for the whole family.","Delicious! We really enjoyed this.","Super good!!! I used a mixture of ground pork and ground bison, light ricotta and light mozzarella. It all fit perfectly in a 9x9 pan. I am passing this on to everyone I know. After all, tis the season for Zucchini's!","Thank you, thank you, thank you this was great.  I used store bought sauce instead and it still came out great. I love it even more because it is low carb.","Divine, tasty, outstanding! What I like the most, my 17 month old daughter loved it! I adapted it to what we like and don't (i.e. no cottage cheese). I also added chuncks of zucchini to the meat along with mushrooms. Definitively a keeper!","I've done this recipe more than twice now, tweaked or as it is... my DH loves it all the time.  Even brought some to work for lunch! thanks for this lovely recipe!","My parents are on the \" Anti-Inflammitory Diet\" which is no grains or pasta, etc. I made for them and it was fabulous! They loved it and I loved it too!!! ( and I am not on the diet).","Absolutely excellent! My husband, 2 year old, Great Aunt and I all loved it. What a great idea! I will be making this many more times :) Thank you!","5++++ stars!  I LOVED this recipe. The leftovers (hardly any) were incredible.  I followed it to a T and it was delicious.","This recipe is good, but will be much lower in carbs if the cheeses are full fat and the tomato sauce is sugar free and omit the tomato paste, as the sugar in the tomatoes concentrates in the paste.","This turned out better than I expected! I wasn't sure that I would like both zucchini and beef in the same dish, but it worked out nicely!","This was superb!  I did not have very high expectations for this and it blew me out of the water!  I did the original measurements to keep it low-cal, but I added more garlic and Italian seasoning to the meat and sauce.  I had to add more water to the sauce to even get it to boil, but it turned out beautifully.  Next time I may try grilling the zucchini.  Thank you for posting, I will be sharing this with many!","I cannot believe how delicious this dish was. I used  3\/4 lb of ground beef, part skim ricotta, 8oz bag of part skim mozzarella as well as whole wheat flour. It was to die for. Next time I might skip the pre-cooking zucchini step since I like a little bit more texture, but that's just a personal preference. This one is a keeper for sure!","Great recipe! I ended up using about 3\/4 lb of ground beef and for the cheese mixture used some part skim ricotta and fat free cottage cheese. Thanks!","Awesome! I used 1 lb of meat and doubled the cheese mixture using mozzarella, ricotta, and cottage cheese. And much to my surprise my picky bf loved it!","I made this recipe last week and talk about delish!!! You definately do not miss noodles in this recipe. It's always nice to eat something that has been modified from the \"norm\" or how it is traditionally made and not notice a difference. Due to our personal tastes I added parsley to the cottage cheese mixture, rather then using fresh tomatos I used a 15oz can of diced tomatos, and double the amount of herbs used in the dish due to Marg's comment about it being slightly bland. Thank you so much for the recipe, I will definately be making this again and will recommend it to others. :)","This is so good!  We definitely did not miss the pasta!  I used 1 lbs of ground beef, double the spices, and added salt.  Before the salt the meat was pretty bland.  I used ricotta because it had slightly less carbs than the cottage cheese I looked at.  Also, I used a colby-jack blend because I'm not a huge mozzerella.  This is definitely a keeper!!   I am going to post it on my facebook right now  :)","This was really good! Didn't miss the pasta at all. I doubled the beef (to 1 lb), didn't bother with the flour, and used two to three times as much water while simmering (added in increments). I had some ricotta to use up, so mixed it with the cottage cheese. I prepped in advance and stuck it in the fridge for a couple of hours before baking. Turned out perfectly!","This is a great recipe for me as I enjoy lasagna but I'm very picky about pasta. I did not pre cook the zucchini and it was perfect. I made it for my diabetic dad to reduce the carbs. I'll use this again and make some personal modifications. Delicious and filling, thank you!","Awesome base recipe, but made for tweeking.  I doubled the beef, a must!  I also doubled the seasoning and garlic.  I used about 3 medium zucchini, (on top of sauce) sliced about 1\/4\" thick to line my baking dish boiled them a little so they would cook faster, seasoned with S&P.  I did the cheese like in the recipe but it was really not enough compaired to all the meat in the sauce so I doubled that but I used ricotta cheese and seasoned that too.  I added a layer of fresh basil leaves on the cheese.  Layered the sauce and zucchini but on top of the last layer I added fresh mozzarella cheese.  Let me tell you I could have eaten the whole tray.  Will double to a 9x13 next time, definetly!!  THANK YOU!!  Just started a low carb way of eating and couldn't come up with anything.  Now I have this.","Nice easy quick way to get a lasagna like dish. Only caveat as an Italian American I say USE ricotta please..it give any lasagna dish authenticity, better flavor and texture. Fresh basil adds more flavor too.","This is more than delicious!! I doubled the meat, used all ricotta cheese, shredded fresh mozarella, and a few more zucchini than listed. I also took a small portion and cooked it without the meat for myself(I cooked everything according to the recipe but just left out the meat). My husband and two year old loved the meat version and I loved the vegeterian version. Absolutely yummy! I will definately make this again!! Thanks!","Made this last night!  I used venison instead of ground beef.  It was delicious!!!  Definately will make again.","We ALL LOVED this!  I used turkey & hot turkey sausage   smoked mozzerella.  Also added in fennel seed & crushed red pepper.  This is now part of the family collection - Thank you!","Amazing! I just finished making 5 of these lasagnas to freeze. It took about 3 hours to make that many, but it used up a ton of zucchini and the family loves this dish. Thank you so much for sharing!","This is by far one of my favorite finds on Food.com!  My husband LOVES this lasagna!  And I love that it is made without the noodles.  Delish!  We make this at least 3 times a month.  I also served it to guests and they raved about it.  Thanks Marg!","Wow, I think I like this better than \"normal\" lasagna!  It's tender and sweet and just plain delicious!  (I used garden combonation Ragu instead of the sauce that was called for, 1\/2 lb lean ground beef and 3 zucchini.)  My picky toddler LOVED it!  Thank you for a terrific and healthy recipe!","I made this today and it was super yummy!  My husband gave it a A .   I only made a few changes.  I used 1lb of ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also didn't add the water.  I grilled the squash on the BBQ just for a few minutes on each side.  I also added some green bell pepper to the sauce. Oh and I doubled the oregano, basil and thyme.","This was a good recipe. I grilled my sliced zucchini before concocting my lasagne. I used ground turkey, doubled the meat, and the cheese mixture as well as the herbs and garlic. Next time I make this, I think I will add an onion bechamel as the top layer to add to the richness. Thanks for a good base recipe.","I'm sorry but I did not like this at all.  I'm a big time low carber and love Italian dishes, and love zucchini normally,  but this just didn't work out at all.  I even grilled the zucchini but instead of blending in, it stood out and never blended with the other ingredients, tasting like grass for some reason.  I followed this recipe exactly, except for adding 1\/2 tablespoon of garlic instead of just the mashed clove.  I did end up eating around the zucchini but I still wasn't thrilled.  Sorry.","Made this tonight and it was great! I  zapped the zuch in the microwave for 2 mins to save some time, used some  marinara sauce from a jar instead of fresh tomatoes, and used ricotta and everything came out great. Thanks for the recipe!","This was great! Definitely going to make again, I don't even miss regular lasagna! Both my roommate and my mom were surprised at how good it was and asked for the recipe. The only change I made was I used jar sauce and added extra cheese, it still turned out great.","Finally a guilt free lasagne recipe :-) Made this twice already and really love it! Thanks Marg!","Great reciepe!!! I ended up going with the no boil lasagna noodles (which I highly reccommend) instead of the zucchini slices. However I did use the zucchini.  I grated 3 zucchini and mixed it in with the tomatoes and seasonings.  I did add extra garlic and I did double the meat. After that I went accordingly to recipe.   My family and I loved it!  The kids (ages 7 and 4) did not notice that there was veggies in it!  Wahoo! :) Score!","It is a keeper. Needs more cheese and zucchini.","OMG, this is excellent.  Other than doubling the garlic, I didn't change a thing.","I made this recipe exactly as written and really liked it.  My DH requested that next time I layer in traditional lasagna noodles since he didn't feel it was real lasagna witthout noodles.  But we both really enjoyed the taste of the zucchini in the lasagna which we had never thought to try before.","Great little dish.  I used 1\/2 lb. each beef and sausage and used fresh homemade ricotta cheese.  Very good and have a little leftover for lunch next week.","I used this recipe as a springboard. I had my own meat sauce leftover from spaghetti and I made a modified version of the ricotta using soy (see my recipe Recipe #324948)<br\/>Funny thing was that 5yr old realized the zucchini when hubby didn't! We did notice it being watery though and that was with precooking the zukes. Hubby suggested keeping in the noodles. I may use the uncooked noodles that you can get that cook right in the dish. That way they could soak up the extra liquid.","I have been low carb for almost a year, and will tell you zucchini lasagna is a fantastic addition to the meal lineup.  You can use any lasagna recipe and substitute zuch for noodles.  I use a cheese slicer to make strips of zuch, boil them a few minutes in a big Texas skillet, dump the water then very lightly brown them in a little butter.  Season the strips with garlic salt and onion powder and they won't be bland!","WOW!!  My husband and I were IMPRESSED!   Absolute winner with this one!<br\/><br\/>I had made up too much meat and veggies, I added celery too.  So I had to add more moisture but instead of water I added a mixture of beef broth and milk.  Other than that, I followed it to a 'T' and it came out great!  Thanks for the recipe!!  :)","Awesome lasagna. I like this much better than regualar lasagna and it's so much lighter. I made two changes: I did not cook the zucchini before layering it and it turned out just the right texture- not too soft but not raw, and I added one small can of tomato sauce to the beef mixture. Delicious, thank you!","This recipe is AMAZING!!!  I liked it better than regular lasagna and will be using the sauce part of the recipe for other recipes! :) :) :)","YUM!  Cooked an extra 10 mins to compensate for not precooking zucchini, and I used a jar of sauce.  I was surprised how little time it all took!  And it got rave reviews:)  Next time I'll put in a couple layers of fresh spinach.  DELISH!","Wow! This was a huge hit with my guys.  It was so hearty and delicious, they didn't even care that it was full of veggies and free of pasta.  The zucchini on top made for a great presentation.  I didnt measure my zucchini, but I think it was a bit more than called for.  I also used vegetarian beef crumbles, which worked perfectly with this recipe (and are a healthier option for those looking to avoid red meat).  I bookmarked this one, and I'll definitely be making it again.  Thanks!","Fabulous! I was craving lasagna and hade a huge zucchini inmy garden. I used a can of Hunts spaghetti sauce in a can its only 1 dollar and added some more seasonings. Used Italian sausage instead of ground beef! Fabulous!!!","Honestly, I can't stand this stuff but my wife loves it to death--happy wife, happy life. Made very minor enhancements as she pretty much expects it as posted. I doubled the meat per Marg's suggestion though I used 1\/2 lb burger and 1\/2 lb hot italian sausage.  For cheese layer I use grated low-moisture mozz and other ingredients as directed but also added chunks of fresh mozz as little surprises. Thumbs up, Marg.","We have made this meal sooo many times and it is fabulous. We personally like it best when the zucchini is shredded in the food processor, then has as much water as possible squeezed out of it ( by squeezing handfuls or wrapping in a tea towel and pressing the heck out of it) then cooked in the microwave for 4 mins. We used the low fat ricotta, and used some Ragu instead of all the separate ingredients for the sauce. We do add all the herbs though because we like it to have a stronger taste. Sometimes we add some chilli powder which kicks it up a notch. We also add some mexican cheese, along with the mozarella, to the top which gives it a yummy crust. Fabulous recipe...thanks so much for posting","This recipe is a really nice change form regular heavy lasagna. I didn't miss the noodles at all. The sauce was too mild for us, so I doubled and tripled some the seasoning and garlic and I think it was still too mild. I'm looking forward to making it again and really tinkering with the sauce to suite our tastes. Thanks for posting this recipe.","This is a great low carb altnative to the original! I did add extra seasonings the second time I made it and doubled the meat the which made it even better than the first time we made it. This will a regular in our house!","Didn't even miss the noodles! I subed ground turkey and low sugar paste sauce. Delish;)","This was SOOOO great!!!  Both my husband and I loved it!  And I think the leftovers were even better!!  I didn't change things too much... instead of the seasonings I used Italian Seasoning.  I used fat free ricotta, instead of tomatoes, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes.  I also used 1 can of tomato paste and one can of tomato sauce as I like a lot of sauce.  Will definitely be making again and again!!","Excellent.  You don't even miss the noodles","Very good lasagna, I followed the recipe, used cottage cheese (even if it looks horrible!)  but did add some extra salt, pepper and herbs. It turned out lovely and we will certainly be making this again, thanks for sharing","This dish is promising, but turned out rather bland based on the ingredient quantities I used (I followed the recipe as written, except doubled the meat and garlic and used 8 oz. of mozzarella cheese).  I will definitely make it again, and next time add salt to the meat mixture, double the seasonings, and maybe substitute half of the mozzarella cheese with sharp cheddar to give it more of a bite.","Terrific recipe. The whole family loved it. Thank you!","The first time I made this I made the four serving size.  This time I doubled it and made a 13&quot; x 9&quot; size because four servings was not enough.  This recipe is a keeper!  I can have my lasagna &quot;fix&quot; without the guilt!  I didn&#039;t have any tomatoes or canned diced so I had some medium salsa on hand and used that instead!  Gave it a little zip and you couldn&#039;t tell it was salsa.   thanx for sharing","To start I used a 9x13 pan, I increased the amount of all the ingredients. I used Pomi strained tomates, they are low in carbs and I used one can of tomato paste. In the sauce I added a blennd of italian seasonings and I used garlic paste in the sauce. I sauteed chopped onions, fresh garlic and mushrooms in a small amount of olive oil. Once those were partially cooked I drained them and set them aside. I used 2 lbs of meat, ground beef and spicy italian ground sausage. I cut the zucchini in long strips about 1\/4 inch thick and quickly balcned them in boiling water. I also used 1\/2 cottage cheese and 1\/2 ricotta cheese. Made the layers as the recipe instructs and baked it. About ten minutes before it was done I added a blend of italian cheese to the top. It was really good!","This was good, but not the best I&#039;ve ever had.  I did use the veggies from the garden, which was a great way to use them.","I made this last night, with the following customizations:&lt;br\/&gt; - Ground turkey instead of ground beef&lt;br\/&gt; - Used shallots instead of onions&lt;br\/&gt; - Added egg (for binding), a whole grated zucchini, ~1cup of baby bellas and ~1\/2 cup of tri-color bell peppers to the meat mixture&lt;br\/&gt; &lt;br\/&gt;It. Was. Fabulous.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;Seriously.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;And, taking it up a notch, I served the leftovers over spaghetti squash tonight and it was just like eating it over al dente angel hair.  &lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;Can&#039;t wait to make again!","loved this!!!! Made it a while back and am making it again tonight, love that dont have to use any pasta and can use the zuchinni right now that they are in season :)","Excellent flavor and I will make again, but I WILL NOT cook the zucchini prior to layering.","Next time I&#039;ll have to double the recipe.  It was too yummy.  I also used 1 lb of lean ground beef.  The sauce is very good.  Thanks Marg :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game","This looks yummy","My daughter is on a low\/no carb diet so I went searching Food.com for a few dinner recipes. This one sounded so good that I decided to make it for all of us. I didn&#039;t pre-boil the zucchini and I doubled the entire the recipe. I also used Hunts traditional sauce for my base. This recipe is truly inspirational. And I am so glad I gave it a shot. We loved it and I will definitely be making it again and again.","I used this recipe as a jumping off point for an AWESOME 5-star lasagna.  I gave the recipe 4 stars because I changed almost everything about it, lol :)  So I have no idea how it would have tasted if I had followed the directions.  I don&#039;t eat red meat, so I used a pound of ground chicken and browned it with onions.  Instead of making sauce from scratch, I used an entire jar of Newman&#039;s Own marinara.  To boost the veggie power of the dish, I added a about a cup each of shredded carrots and roughly chopped baby bella mushrooms to the sauce (after sauteeing them in the &quot;drippings&quot; from the chicken &amp; onions).  I let that simmer while I prepared the rest of the ingredients.  DO NOT STRESS about slicing the zucchini super thin.  The thinner pieces did not hold up very well and the thicker pieces were nice to bite into.  I used 4 whole zucchinis, - including the outside edge pieces - and sauteed them with a little bit of olive oil, salt\/pepper and chicken stock.  I could have eaten those alone.  For the cheese, I mixed equal parts shredded mozzarella and shredded sharp cheddar into the ricotta\/egg mixture for a bolder flavor.  I also added about a half cup of thawed frozen chopped spinach and a touch of chicken stock with salt\/pepper.  Next time I might try a little lemon juice and\/or zest for zing.  After layering the ingredients I refrigerated the whole thing for a couple of hours because I had to step out and that was totally fine.  when I got back I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 then sprinkled the rest of the mozzarella\/cheddar mixture on top, fired up the broiler, and seared a it to a nice crispy finish.  It was delicious!  To avoid getting too chubby by wolfing down all that cheese at once, I am planning to serve the reheated leftovers on a bed of sauteed shredded zucchini, mushrooms, and spinach tonight.  Bon Appetit!","I started a low carb diet 4 weeks ago, and have made alot of the recipes on this site, I haven&#039;t found a bad one yet. I&#039;ve lost 7lbs!!!! I made this one the other night, and it was AWSOME I used 5 zucchini&#039;s cuz they were on the skinny side and about 8 or 9 inches long. Had my hubby slice them on the madolin( I cause harm to myself with that thing!!). I layered it like a traditional lasagna 3 layers, I also seasoned the egg\/ cheese mixture with S\/P, parsley and italian seasoning. I didn&#039;t cook the zucc, cuz we like our veggies al dente, didn&#039;t miss the pasta at all. Will definitly make again!!! Thanks, for posting!","Great for low carb eater. I also use eggplant in place of the zucchini. It&#039;s excellent!","I just made this tonight and it was delish. I used ricotta cheese. Did about a pound &amp; 1\/2 of meat, and I sliced the zucchini and par-boiled the slices about 7 minutes. I put it in a 7X12 pan and it was perfect. I didn&#039;t have the fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of stewed tomatoes with Italian seasoning and used the juice from the tomatoes instead of the water. I had shredded 5-Italian cheese on hand and I was a bit more generous with the cheese mixture, and the cheese on top. My husband does not want me to change a thing, but I think next time I&#039;ll use bottled spaghetti sauce, since it could use a bit more seasoning, and I always have that on hand.","Very good recipe and like others I did change it a bit to my liking. I used 1 lb beef, doubled the spices, and added a tablespoon of sugar.  I used two cans of diced tomatoes. Also added about 1 tsp of salt.  Very very good !  I could have eaten the whole dish all by myself.","I&#039;m making this tonight. I changed it up a bit, I used sea salt and ground fresh pepper on the zucchini as I layered it, used veggie crumbles (Morning Star) to replace the meat, roasted garlic tomato paste, 1tsp fennel, use ricotta cheese, and diced up baby portabella mushrooms (cooked with crumbles and after the last zucchini layer, before shredded cheese).","Awesome meal, I doubled the recipe to make a full size lasagne, I also boiled the zucchini for about 3 minutes to make it softer (good way to fool the children).  I love healthy alternatives for my family and this will go into my recipe box!","This was a wonderful basic recipe that allowed me to make changes.  Instead of ground beef, I used ground chicken.  I did not have enough ricotta cheese and I did not want to buy more (I kind of felt like it would be too much cheese since I was using shredded cheddar and shredded Mexican blend cheeses.)  I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes which was seasoned with garlic\/oregano\/basil, and a garlic\/basil\/oregano spaghetti sauce instead of the listed spices as those two items had all the spices needed for a tasty dish.  As well, I layered the bottom of the pan with zucchini and then proceeded to do the layering. This was a very easy dish to make and so so delicious.  You can&#039;t go wrong!","Really good I tripled the ingredients and added ground hot sausage to the meat and added red hot pepper flakes","I just made this with 1 lb of beef.. I cooked the garlic with the onions and beef and added salt and pepper while it cooked. Otherwise I did it just as it said and its delicious! Pleasantly suprised on this one. Great way to cut out the pasta. Still has the same texture.","Love this dish.  :)  Have made it several times with whichever ingredients I have on hand:  ground turkey, chicken, or beef and it&#039;s all been good.  I announced that this is what is for dinner this evening, and got a &quot;Yay!&quot; from the living room.  ha  Thanks for the pasta alternative.  :)","Loved the recipe! I followed other reviews and doubled the maet and spices. I also used double the ricotta cheese. Overall it fed 4 people who don&#039;t eat a lot . In the future I&#039;ll double what I made in a 9x13 pan like another reviewer said.","Doubled this recipe. Left out the onions due to personal preference. Used half the water, twice the cheese, twice the meat  (2lbs), and twice the garlic (4 cloves). \nIt turned out absolutely perfect. Just as good as any noodle lasagna I&#039;ve ever made. Definitely will be making again and sharing with friends. Thank you!","Great starter recipe!  I made a few small changes though. \n\nSubstitutions:\nI used an additional zucchini.\n\nI doubled the meat, garlic, and seasonings (I used Italian seasoning instead of the separate ones).\n\nI used 1 lb ground beef and 1\/2 lb of each Italian sausage &amp; maple sausage.&nbsp;\n\n\nI used an extra can of tomato paste for the consistency I was looking for. \n\n\nI used a block of cream cheese instead because I didn&#039;t have any ricotta or cottage cheese on hand, and it was so amazing. My husband preferred it to the cottage cheese\/ricotta. \n\n\nNext time I&#039;ll add saut&eacute;ed mushrooms too.&nbsp;","I am watching the dish bubble in the oven right now. Thanks for a good way to feed the family some of the fruits of the garden. I tweaked the recipe some, but nothing worth mentioning here. I will likely try this recipe again.","Very nice way to avoid pasta, if one chooses. I felt like there was excessive tomato paste and not enough water. I also added a little sweetening to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. Put more cheese on top and a little Parmesan. We enjoyed it paired with a green salad.","This recipe was awesome.   Did add extra garlic by previous reviews.  Also added mushrooms ( had to eat them up). But even my pasta loving husband loved it.  Told me to please make it again.  Thanks so much for sharing.","I feel great about feeding this to my family and even my veggie hating, picky child liked it! We did modify the recipe by using venison instead of beef. We didn't add any other spices but did use more of the spices the recipe called for. After putting it in the baking dish, we decided ours needed more veggies to complete the second layer so we were able to use some pre-steamed leftover veggies from a frozen mix we buy including yellow and orange carrots, and red bell pepper. We sauteed fresh green bell pepper along with the meat, onion, and other ingredients. I can definitely see us making this again.","I made this a couple of weeks ago and we loved it.

Thanks for a real winner Dancer!","I have made this salad for years! It is a family favorite. I make a few small (but worthwhile) changes, first, I sautee chicken breasts in a little oil and butter, then shred or cube the meat, add the BBQ sauce, and let it simmer to absorb the flavor. Then I use Green Giant Mexicorn (with red pepper) to save time. I do not put the cheese or lettuce in the black bean\/onion\/tomato mixture, it just gets soggy, for each salad, I put down a layer of lettuce, then the corn\/bean relish, then chicken, then dressing, and top it off with the cheese and olives. Lastly, I ALWAYS serve it in a flour tortilla shell bowl! Just place a burrito sized flour tortilla in a metal (or other oven proof) bowl of appropriate size, (prick it a few times to prevent bubbles) Or use a tortilla shell bowl form which is what I have. And bake @ 350 until brown, and crisp. (about 12 min or so)  The flavor of this salad is INCREDIBLE!

It was absolutely delicous and the first authentic Irish meal we had and while all the food was great there was nothing that could beat the Irish Stew.  When I found the recipe on this site, I immediately tried it and it is exactly like what we had in Ireland.  When my cousin came to dinner and I served it, he was sure I had gotten the recipe from O'Connors Pub while we were in Ireland.  It was a cinch to make, directions were very easy to follow and it practically cooks itself.  It is equally as good over mashed potatoes or rice.  Try it, you'll like it. The one ingredient I added was a \"wee bit of blarney\"","Mine came out really bitter.  Doesn't taste too good on its own, but lovely with herbed garlic butter.","I add more veggies and more stout, and cut down on the beef stock... green beans and carrots, potatoes and a little bit of cabbage. Best thing about this recipe is that you can mess with it as you like...nothing's set or required (beside the Guinness of course! :D )","Great recipe!  I added some peas and potatoes to it and cooked it on top of the stove rather than in the oven.  Easier to keep an eye on it.

I did add potatoes, and about a full cup of Guinness. Other than that just followed the directions and it was much better than we had hoped for. You have to hope it's great if you're going to use Guinness in it, don't want to waste any of that :) Thank you very much.","Outstanding stew! Like my son, I had it with potatoes and, because of my onion intolerance, it was made with only a quarter of the recipe's called for amount of onions. Nice and thick, full flavored, great dish on a cold day. Served with thick slabs of bread. It'll be made again!","I'm planning a St. Patrick's Day dinner and I wanted to experiment with a couple of recipes before I served them to guests.  Well, this stew is the best!

No leftovers! We'll take this one camping.","We did modify your original recipe to include potatoes, mushrooms & celery. My husband's eyes are always bigger than his stomach.  We doubled the stock & guinness to accomodate the additional vegetables.  The beef was really tender, the best we've made so far.  We found the rosemary was a bit overpowering in the stew.

I add three stocks of thyme while it cooks and then add picked thyme leaves at the very end as well as the parsley. All in all a fantastic meal. I serve it with Perfect Traditionally English Roast Potatoes by Kellogs recipe number Recipe #109070. Absolutely lovely!","Good Stew!  Added three nice sized potatoes, and went with one cup of Guinness stout for some extra kick.  I might throw in some extra garlic cloves next time, though.","We had this stew last night. It was quite good, however I think next time I make it I will use less rosemary, as for me, it really overpowered the dish.  I added a couple of potatoes and 1 cup Guiness.

I cooked my stew on top of the stove for about 90 minutes and served it over mashed potatoes as suggested by Fran Kelly.  I did use less rosemary (1\/2 tsp) as suggested by Wildflower5150.

Like others, I also added some potatoes, and a little extra liquid to make up for them.  I disagree with some other reviewers who thought there was too much rosemary.  I added the full amount, and it was PERFECT.  I love rosemary, though.  10,000 stars. :)","I thought this was a good start for stew, put I needed to add flavor to it.

I did a couple tweeks but now many.  I didn't feel like wasting a 1\/4 c beef stock by dumping it (I used bouillon cubes) so I added 1 tsp flour and chopped up some potatoes and put in.

I made a few modifications to initial recipe- I used the whole bottle of Guiness (< 2c), 1c of beef broth, fresh rosemary instead of dried as that was what I had, about a pound of carrots, and added 5 potatoes, peeled and diced. I browned the roast initially and cooked the onions in the pan with the oil and bay leaves like the recipe stated but I then placed the whole roast in the crockpot to cook (not cut into chunks) and shredded after it cooked- just fell apart easily. I put all ingredients in the crock pot and let cook on low for 8 hours. Wonderful flavor and many compliments!! People that don't like beer even loved the taste as the guiness was not overwhelming. Thanks for a great recipe I will definitely make again!","This was very good.  Made mostly as directed, but put in oven in a big pot covered for a few hours rather than cooking on stove.  Will make again.  Thanks.","We loved this - it was simple enough that my kids didn't fuss about it!  I made it to use up some stout, but I will buy more so I can make it.","This was just okay in my opinion.  The Guinness was not a recognizable flavor as the thyme and rosemary kind of overpowered.  Not a recipe I will be repeating.","I've tried several recipes for Guinness stew, and this one is perfect. Good and hearty, and not too sweet! I skip the carrots because we don't prefer them, and I use shallots instead of the yellow onion (because that's what I usually have on hand), but other than that I didn't have to make any changes. It's wonderful served over boiled potatoes tossed in salt, pepper, and fresh parsley, a side of soda bread, and a generous garnish of parsley!","Can't wait to try this. We just returned from 2 weeks in Ireland where one week was spent in Doolin. My husband must have eaten the Beef & Guinness stew every night at O'Conner's pub!","I made this today......and am still shocked at how good my stew was.  I've made every stew I could find over the course of 45  years, and never got that \"perfect\" taste that I was looking for.....until today.!!!  I can't believe that it uses a beer that I don't even like and turned out so good. (I didn't use 1\/2 cup, just poured in the whole bottle.)<br\/>I browned the meat and onions on the stove,(I did lightly dust the meat with some flour before browning,  made the broth, and poured into my crockpot.   I think that helped thicken the broth a bit.<br\/>Then I added the sliced carrots, some celery and stirred them into the pot.Since my DH likes a little heat to his stew, I added about 1\/2 jalapeno pepper.<br\/>After the stew had cooked for one hour, I added cubed potatoes and cooked for another hour.  I added the frozen peas right at the end . The 2 hr. timing was perfect, although I did hold it on low for a while till dinner time. <br\/>Thank you so much for this recipe......I think I will have it engraved on my cutting board...Ha.<br\/>Donna<br\/>UPDATE..........I tried this with another stout, but it just wasn't the same. I was so disappointed and since I am going to make it again tomorrow, I bought Guinness this time.  I know it will be great. (  My Irish Grandpa and his family in Ireland will be smiling)...Ha.","At the first sign of cooler temps I am ready for stew or some other warm one-pot meal. This stew fit the bill. We really enjoyed the flavor imparted by the beer. There was a subtle sweetness to it. I did add all of the stout since I had a larger bottle, and I too added potatoes. This is a winner even if you improvise other veggies I think. This will be one of my go-2s for stew.","I recently returned from Ireland and loved so many of their dishes . So this was my first attempt to make something Irish in my Kitchen . As always I follow my first try at a new recipe to the letter. Results : The flavor was great ! The liquid should have been more so the beef stew could have cooked longer since it was not tender enough . Next time I make this yummy stew I will cook it in a slow cooker using more Guiness and broth ( also I will use chicken broth since I feel it offers more flavor )"],"vegetarian":"Y","pescetarian":"Y","vegan":"Y","lactose intolerant":"Y","gluten free":"Y","peanut allergy":"Y","kosher":"Y","halal":"Y"},{"id":820,"name":"healthy pie crust","minutes":0,"ingredient_ids":[2683,6270,1043,6516],"ingredients":["flour","salt","canola oil","skim milk"],"steps":["combine oil with flour and salt","drizzle with milk","this makes 2 crusts , or one top and one bottom enjoy ! cindy"],"description":"here's a recipe for ","calorie_level":2,"avg_rating":4.2121212121,"review":["I truly could not get the crust to stay together, even though I tried freezing it.

It was flaky, as was mentioned in the caption, but I had to use more milk than the recipe called for so that it didn't come apart.  However, I made this crust for a chicken pot pie, and I think it made the pie!  It was delicious.  It goes to show you that a little patience pays off.  Thanks!","Turned out great.  No problems.  ","This pie crust did not come together like a regular pie crust, so I worked it into the pan as you would a cookie crumb crust.  I used it for quiche, therefore I did not blind bake it.  The crust was not flakey but it was tasty and had a nice consistency.  \r\n","I started out making pie crusts in this manner as a similar recipe was found in an jr. recipe book. It was meant to make it an easy (and now deemed healthier for the canola as opposed to butter\/lard\/shortening) What my old recipe called for was to roll the pastry between two pieces of waxed or baking paper. You might find that will make handling much easier. ","This is a tasty crust, and I appreciated its low saturated fat content.  I used grape seed oil and whole wheat pastry flour.  With this combo, I needed to use more flour.  I loved this crust for the turkey pot pie (Thanksgiving leftovers!) I made with it.  Thanks for posting!","loved it! I'm not at all experienced with pie making or pie crusts, but I also found this just a bit difficult to work with.  I ended up cutting it in half to get it into the pie pan and then pinching it together.  \r\n\r\nNice texture, and amazingly tasty, especially for something with the word 'healthy' in it! Used it for a quiche yesterday, and it turned out really great... thank you for sharing!","This was my first try at a pie crust.  I made an apple pie out of it and it turned out great!  The crust was flaky and tasty.  I pressed the bottom into the pie plate and rolled the top crust between 2 pieces of parchment paper.  It was a bit more dense than a traditional pie crust (with shorting) but the trade off was worth it for using a healthier alternative..the canola oil.  thanks for the recipe, i will use it again!","I have been making pie crusts for many years using the standard shortening recipe. We love this one. I used extra light olive oil (no canola) and chilled it before rolling. To keep it from falling apart, I layered it between sheets of overlapped cling wrap. After it was thin, I peeled the top wrap off, turned the pie plate over the crust, and pressed the crust into the pie plate. Then I gently peeled the wrap off and pinched togeter the gaps. Also, I used Healthy Choice flour that has more whole grain in it. Great recipe!","I tried this because I needed a pie crust really quickly last night. I didn't want to take the time to chill it or roll it out, so I just pressed each half of the dough into a pie pan. My family loved it. I may never buy a crust for my family again! (I'll still use frozen crust when I'm taking the pie to someone, so they won't have to worry about giving me back the pan.) Thanks.","I'm not sure if I did this wrong. I didn't have any problems with the recipe.  I halved it and substituted in olive oil.  I had no problems rolling it or placing it on my pie.  It seemed like regular dough to me.  But I've never made a pie crust before, I just had to use this as an emergency since my store bought crust broke when I tried to put it on top!  Hope my pie turns out!","Unbelievable!  What a great pie crust! I used 1 cup flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour (not stone ground) and 1\/2 cup WW Pastry flour.  I had to try the recommendation where the baker didn't roll out the crust and instead just pressed it into a greased pie plate.  It worked!  This will be my only pie crust recipe and will not even look anymore at them!","I used one of those pie crust makers that is the round plastic thing with the zipper.  I didn't have any problem rolling it out, however the first crust I did was hard to pick up and put on the plate, even using the plastic thing to hold it.  It broke up a bit.  The second time, I added more milk, and chilled it.  I'm not sure how it would have fared had I tried to pick up the whole thing because I cut this one into strips for a lattice top, so it was easier to pick up the pieces. But it tasted good, and everyone I asked said it tasted good.","This was my first attempt at pie crust, which I was making for a quiche. I knew it was going to be hard to roll, so I just went ahead and used my finger to press it into the pie plate in pieces after rolling it out to get it to the right thickness. It worked really well and the crust did come out flaky. My only real complaint was that it was much too salty for me. Next time I would cut the salt to 1\/2 tsp. It did get better after a couple of days in the fridge.","I cut this recipe in half because I didn't need a top crust. Also took the advice of another member to roll between 2 pieces of parchment. Before that I lightly mixed the ingredients until corse then refridgerated for an hour. I highly recommend putting it in the fridge, it makes it so much better to roll. Made recipe #31128 for the filling, minus the FINAL TOPPING of pecans and caramel.","It was the first pie i have ever made and it turned out.... WOW!!! My whole family who has been eating pies there whole life said it was the BEST PIE they have ever eaten. I did whole wheat flour instead and i added cin. and sugar on the top which made it even better!! Thanks a TON!!! Happy Thanksgiving!!","Best pie crust ever!  I would add that I roll the  flattened and floured dough halves out onto a floured surface and then loosen with a spatula and slip one of those extra thin plastic cutting boards under it and then slide the crusts right into the pie pans.","I've made this twice for beef pot pie. It goes together really well, and I use wheat flour and applesauce (instead of the oil). It turns out great, but hard to handle in the raw form. Freezing helped. Overall, I like it!","Worked Great! Easy, fast and tasty. I cannot ask for a better recipe than this. It's almost as easy as frozen pie crusts, only I don't have to remember to buy a box keep in the freezer. I divided the dough into two parts. Rolled each into a ball, put each ball between parchment paper and rolled out. Great recipe. The second time I made this I substituted the flour with King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour and it tasted great.  Kind of nutty.  However, the dough was more difficult to work with.  Next time I may just do half four and half whole wheat flour.  Thank you.","Quick and easy to make.  Loved the taste thanks a bunch!","I made this with soy milk because I can't drink regular milk.  I didn't have any problems rolling it out after refrigerating the dough for an hour.  This crust is more brittle than ones made with shortening or butter and reminds me of a very light shortbread.","I love it!! I use less salt and add sugar instead.","Great, didn't change a thing.  I used the chill and roll b\/t two sheets of cling wrap and it rolled out perfect!  The pickiest eater in my family couldn't stop talking about this crust.  :)","Worked out great! Although I used olive oil...will use this recipe again for when I make Chicken Pot Pie.","I have used this recipe many times, and just now remembered to review it!  Love it, but we cut the salt.  I never take the time to chill and roll; just pat in the pan for a nice bottom crust.  Thanks.","This was fantastic! I usually use a lard\/hot water crust for my awesome apple pie, but  recently I've been trying to find healthy alternatives. This did the trick! The crust came out crumbly and perfect.","This was really an amazing crust.  No, it's not your typical butter-flaky crust, but it was quite good.  I used 1\/2 whole wheat flour, and 1\/2 white flour, plus I added 1 T vinegar for flavor.  I did have to add quite a bit more milk, and rolled it between wax papers, but it was pretty easy to work with.  I made Recipezaar #45070 Pot Pie, but used beef instead of turkey , and it was awesome!!  Thanks for the healthy recipe.","I cut this recipe in half for use with a ham and spinach quiche (#147160 here). I didn't even attempt to roll out the crust, and instead just pressed it with my fingers into the pie plate. Baked it for a bit at 375 to set it before filling with the quiche. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.","Came out pretty good but doesn't act like your usual pie crust.","This worked out way better then i thought, i did what other reviewers suggested and placed it in the fridge for half an hour or so and had no problems rolling it out,  i also placed 1tsp of sugar and 1tsp cinnamon because i was making a banana cream pie. I will be using this for my pie crust from now on!","I&#039;ve made this pie crust several times now and will keep using it. I substituted unflavored COCONUT MILK for the milk and it came out great. I rolled the dough between two sheets of non-stick parchment paper and had no trouble. I didn&#039;t even have to refrigerate the dough first. It was quick and easy.","Flakey, butter, and soo good.

Like Clifford Boren and Cas, I used Dijon mustard and took Jan's lead adding minced onion to the beef. It was good and my husband liked it, too.

Absolutely, at least double the sauce...I actually tripled it, because I am a \"sauce person.\"  I also cut down a little on the mustard, and added about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  This is a fantastic, easy recipe to make, and quite easy to tailor the sauce to your own particular likes or dislikes.  Would be really hard to mess up!","Even on a medium-low heat, my butter-mustard mixture burned and tasted awful...plus my patties were still raw in the middle.  Seems that my gas stove runs hot!","Fabulous!  I made this last night, and we couldn't get enough of it.  Taking the advice of the reviewers, I wanted to double the sauce.  When I removed the meat to add the mustard, I also added about a cup or so of milk and a little bit of flour.  The mixture thickened immediately and stretched all that yummy meat flavor even further!  I'm a garlic lover, so I sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on the patties as they were cooking initially.  I also served it with garlic toast.  QUITE YUMMY!","I liked this very much! Right up my alley. I did mine in my huge electric skillet - had no problem with anything burning.I bought ground sirloin because there was no ground round put out at the store and I didn't want to cal and wait.

Thanks for sharing!","A friend gave me this recipe when I was first married & I've been using it ever since. We love it!","This was just wonderful... had never tried anything like it before and will make it again!","These were good.  I added onion soup mix, and next time I think I'll leave it out.  Also, I wasn't happy with the ground beef I used--an organic brand, and it had a lot of crunchy bits.  Yuck.

So for us it didn't look that great but tasted fabulous. I took the advice of past reviewers and threw some minced onion in my patties and I doubled the sauce. I doubled everything but the butter, it just seemed \"greasy\" enough. Next time I would probably triple the sauce. I served these with Ranch Potatoes # 103929. Great simple meal!","Sorry but me and my husband really didn't like these...I made them exactly as directed. ","This was delicious!  I listened to the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the sauce.  I did not have fresh lemons - so I used the juice of one large orange.  For my husband and I, I served it over a bed of spinach with a little bit of the sauce and sliced avocados on top. He loved it. My kids, who just ate it as a hamburger patty loved it too.  It was quick and very easy - so we will definitely be having this again.","I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was great.  The sauce kept seperating despite my best efforts to keep it together, but I loved it nonetheless.  Thanks for sharing!","I wonder if some of the grease problems were from using higher fat meat?  I used ground chuck and cooked the burger a little before simmering them in the sauce.   That helped with the excess fat in the meat.  I still had to removed some excess fat from the finished sauce but that was easy enough.  I would actually trip the sauce next time but I used 2lbs of meat.  I also think that adding some breadcrumbs and onion to the meat would be great.  That said we all liked the flavor of the sauce a lot!  Great variation on a staple in our home.","These are very good.  I'm not much on plain hamburgers, so these were nice and flavorful.  I made them with ground turkey to deal witht he grease problem that some members had.  I made them according to directions one time with 2-3 times the sauce, and it was good, but the next time I took someone else's advice and mixed everything together.  I ate them on a bun without anything else.  Very good!","While certainly simple and tasty -- I think it is worthy of praise between 3 and 4 stars.  I thouroughly enjoy burgers -- grilled and plain,  and this was a nice change of pace.","I did as one reviewer opined and just mixed the sauce ingredients into the burgers themselves.  I enjoyed the flavor, but because I had to hold dinner in the oven while awaiting my DH from work, they weren't as juicy as I would've liked. I omitted the butter and added garlic and onion powder.  They were good, but I suspect that sauce on the side wold be much better.  Next time I'll try the recipe, doubling the sauce, as written, except maybe adding a little grated cheese into the burgers or making them a bit meat-loafy--something to make them more tender and juicy.","This is a very enjoyable way to eat hamburger.  I don't care for hamburgers overly much, and if I eat them I want them dressed up somehow.  I really like the sauce on these.  It elevates a plain burger into something more.  After reading the other reviews I also doubled the sauce and let it run into the rice I served alongside.  Yum!","This didn't work out for me like it did for everyone else.  Boo hoo!  I'm wondering if it's something that I did.  I followed the directions.  I had to cook mine for quite a bit longer as the insides were still very raw.  I do like medium rare.  So, I stopped at medium rare.  It did have great flavor.  But, the sauce just looked gross and was all separted. The pictures posted were so beautiful!  I'm going to have another go at this but take someone's advice to add flour and milk to make more of cream sauce instead of such a greasy sauce.  I did cook the patties a bit to pour off the meat grease before I began with the sauce.  Thanks for a great start!","An excellent way to make plain old hamburger meat into a delicious meal.","really simple & interesting! we had it with mac & cheese & cauliflower.  yum!","This is really tasty, easy and fast to put together.  I'll make it again for sure!\nThanks for this one!\nN@","Very good! Nice change from plain burgers! Thanks for posting! :)","I used whole grain mustard for this.  While cooking the meat, the mustard seeds burned, so I had to throw it out and start over.  The second time, I VERY carefully watched the heat, and they still burned!  The heat was so low that I ended up finishing the meat in the microwave, which I've never had to do before.  I had to throw out the sauce AGAIN and just made a gravy.  But I could tell from the flavor on the meat that it was delicious, so I'll refrain from giving it any stars until I can figure out how to make it without burning!","Delicious!  I added garlic powder along with the salt and pepper before making the patties.  I had to drain the fat off the pan before adding lemon juice and W. sauce (plus more mustard) in the final step.  I doubled those ingredients and it made the perfect amount of sauce to spoon over the burgers.

Wonderful flavor. I made some for breakfast and served them with sausage gravy. Easy to make too!","Yum....Loved it.  Very easy, light and fluffy.","This is the best biscuit recipe I've ever made!\r\n\r\nThey came out very light and fluffy and rose beautifully in the oven.  Any biscuit recipe I usually try leaves me with flat biscuits.\r\n\r\nI really liked the method of mixing the milk and shortening in at the same time; it cut prep time and kept the shortening from melting as I cut it in.\r\n\r\nNext time I make these, I will use Splenda instead of sugar (we are diabetics).  I will update my review for that change.","Excellent biscuits.  Have to admit, I used a pastry cutter-I didn't want the mess on my hands.  Very sticky dough, ended up adding at least 1\/2 cup more flour on the board and got sticky hands anyway.  It was worth it.","These were great! Light and tender, but they didn't fall apart when I put butter on them. Thanks for a keeper!","These biscuits were very tasty. I like how the bottom crisped up, but didn't dry out. They had a great texture too. The only thing that I adjusted was the salt. I thought my first batch was a bit salty, so I only added 1 tbsp. to the next batch. All in all- a great biscuit!!","This was a good biscuit.","Very good biscuits. I have made these often :) Last time I was out of shortening and use butter in its place. Very good! Thanks for such a great recipe. Definately in my cookbook forever! :)","Very nice.  Using lard gives you a flakier crust, I think.  If you can eat lard, try it  that way.","Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe. My daughter helped and used large cookie cutters instead of biscuit cutter and we had the greatest teddy bear, star and choo choo train biscuits! Tons of fun and yum yum!","I fixed these for my husband for breakfast this morning and he loved them! Nice and soft, just the way he likes it. I served these topped with butter, with scrambled eggs and veggie bacon. Thanks!","This would have gotten 5 stars, but 1 1\/2 teaspoons of salt is a bit much for only 1 1\/2 cups of flour. We used the stated amount of salt the first time and the 9 biscuits were just too salty. The second time we used 1 tsp and they were still a bit salty. We think 1\/2 tsp might be better (compare amounts of salt in other biscuit recipes). Otherwise, the biscuits were great! (I will ask if the 1 1\/2 tsp of salt is a typo.)","These were very tender and had good flavor but I agree with an earlier review about the salt. They were very, very salty . next time I will cut the salt by more than half. Raised up really light and high.","Yeah baby! This is the one. the ingredients are basically similar to other recipes, but the gentler mixing by hand makes the difference I think.  Yeah, your hand will get gloppy, but it's kind of fun to mush it up.  Very light and fluffy inside, nice crispy outside, perfect texture and flavor.  I was thinking of using butter flavored crisco, but I used plain instead and am happy with that choice.  I also cut the salt to 1 tsp.  I made 6 good size biscuits.  OK, so maybe making perfect biscuits isn't the answer to life's larger dilemmas, but it makes a hell of an egg and cheese sandwich!","Very nice flavor. Will definitely make again. I also cut the salt amount at the suggestion of the other reviews. Thanks for posting.","Great biscuit recipe! Crispy on the outside and flaky inside! Great jam crevasses! Thanks for sharing!","This biscuit had a nice flavor and the crunchy outside that I like. Reminded me of  my Mom's biscuits. I served this with sausage gravy on top. \r\nI liked the easy preparation for the dough. It seemed a little quicker than the way I usually mix my biscuit dough.\r\n\r\nThanks Ron&Joyce. \r\n\r\nBullwinkle.\r\n\r\n","These were delicious! I also cut down on the salt and grated frozen butter into the mix instead of shortening because I find that makes them very puffy. I added some bacon that I had left over from breakfast that I chopped into little pieces along with some grated cheddar. I added about a quarter cup more milk and a touch more baking powder to make up for this and they cooked about 5 minutes longer. I buttered them and served alongside some Manhattan Clam Chowder and they were so goooood! Thanks for the great and easy recipe!","You've just replaced my tired old biscuit recipe!! I did they that they were a bit salty so next time I will cut it back to 1 tsp. Other than that they were perfect.","These are the biscuits  I have always eaten.  They are very delicious!  Thanks for posting this recipe.    ","i also used cookie cutters and they were kinda small so i got 24 delicious minibiscuits!","Great taste!  I cut the salt down to about a 1\/2 of a teaspoon and there was no problem with excessive saltiness.  I used butter flavored shortening, and the result was amazing.","Great recipe. This will become my homemade biscuit recipe from now on.  When I first made this, I wasn't sure how they would come, considering the mixing.  Mixing the dry ingredients with liquid first and adding shortening together.  They were the best.  I must admit the first time I added melted butter on top after they came out of the oven because I thought they would be bad tasting.  Oh my, were they delicious, hubby loved them.  Next time I made them, no butter, just as great.  They just melt in your mouth.","Great biscuits! I used a 2 1\/2 inch cutter, so I got about 6 biscuits out of the dough. They were soft and buttery. I also took a little of the shortening out, and added butter. Soft and melt in your mouth!I brushed butter over the tops right before they came out of the oven, so they browned up nicely. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks so much!","These turned out good even though I ended up using olive oil in place of the vegetable shortening (I was all out of shortening). I was surprised at how well they turned out. I did decrease the salt to just a pinch. A nice change from my usual biscuit recipe. ","These are just like what we call scones in australia and I found it an easy receipe Thanks","I loved these!  They were so good, I didn't need to use butter.  Very easy to make, but the yield is small.  I patted these into a square and cut it into quarters.  They weren't as pretty as the picture, but the taste made up for it!  Thanks for a great recipe!","I don't usually have much luck with biscuits, but these turned out very nice and tender. I used them on top of this recipe <a href=\"\/64379\">Hamburger Casserole<\/a>. :)","I made these biscuits as a side to beef stew and they were terrific.  I read some of the reviews and cut down on the salt. Thank you for posting this recipe.","These biscuits are good and taste similar to KFC, however next time I'll cut back on the salt to 1\/2 teaspoon because they were almost too salty. Thanks for the recipe!","I just made these, was a bit worried because I didn't have butter or shortning.  I used vegetable oil......forgot the sugar, but they turned out great! Very easy to make, I didn't even have to get my hands gooey since I used oil....just mixed with a spoon and dropped them on the baking sheet!  Will make more tomorrow and remember the sugar!","I am a Biscuit lover....No really I am!!  I ONLY get the biscuits when I go to KFC!  These are SO delicious, and easy! \r\nI made a defferent recipe the other night, and they were awful!!  My family were afraid to try these...but gobbled them all up!  Next time I will probably roll them out a little thicker than 1\/2\", and I will put a drizzle of butter on top!!  Excellent!!","These had to be the absolute BEST biscuits i've every made. I wasn't sure how they would come out, because the milk was being added to the flour before the butter had been incorporated into the flour. The only thing I changed was I only used 1 teaspoon of salt and I didn't have reg. milk that day so i used the heavy cream and 1\/3 cup of butter the results were amazing!! These biscuits were so light and buttery, this will be the only recipe I will ever use!!!!","I made these a week ago and DH said nothing about how good they were, I didn't push because I hate the obligatory \"they were good\".  This morning he asked if I could make \"those biscuits I made last week\" for breakfast....\nThey are wonderful, light, great texture and IF you have any leftovers they keep well...Thank you for sharing.","Sorry- we just thought these were dry, plain, and tasteless.  My DH is usually polite, but even he made a negative comment about these.  I made them almost exactly as stated (the only change I made was to cut the salt in half) so I'm not sure why we weren't as thrilled as the other reviewers.  Anyway, thanks for sharing, but we'll just have to keep looking for that ideal biscuit recipe.","These biscuits are kind of ridiculous. In a very good way. \n\nThey were were huuuuuge, heightwise, and very, very light and fluffy. Very nice texture.\n\nMy usual biscuit recipe calls for both shortening AND butter in the mix, and I kind of missed that in these, but the texture\/height is probably sacraficed when using butter...  \n\nEither way, these are GREAT, and I'm definitely keeping this recipe at hand.\n\n...I feel so sly, knowing all the Colonel's tricks now... :D","Oh wow these really do taste like the ones at KFC! Good now I don't have to pay for good biscuits anymore!These came out picture perfect and I mean restaurant quality! They were moist and had SO much flavor! I really like the recipe amount to...its just enough for casseroles in place of refrig biscuits!","These are by far the best biscuits we've ever eaten! Not only do they taste great, the texture is fantastic as well.\r\n\r\nDefinately a keeper - thanks! :)","Beautiful flaky biscuits - just what I was looking for!  Thanks a bunch!","Wow! In all my twice-30 years I've never been able to make a decent biscuit. Today, with 25 minutes to mealtime, I decided to try this recipe. Didn't have any shortening...did have butter in the freezer! Lopped off about a 1\/3 cup and GRATED IT (large hole) into the flour. Easy...effective...excellent. (I'd cut down on the salt next time, too.) Thanks for the great recipe.","OMGosh!!!!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY these are by far the BEST biscuits everrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!! They taste just like KFC biscuits...I tripled the batch and they went fast!! You gotta try this one!","I DID IT!  Yippie!  As I first started mixing this in the bowl it was really sticky and I thought, \"Not again\"!  My poor biscuit skills almost got me, but when I turned everything onto the floured counter and started kneading, it came together almost magically!  It really does make exactly 9 biscuits. Very fluffy but just a little salty.  I'll cut back on the salt next time. There will finally be a next time!!!","Since I have to rate the recipe as written, I can only give it 4 stars because the biscuits were WAY too salty.  Seriously, I could hardly eat them and I followed the recipe exactly.  My boyfriend even commented on the salt.  I will definitely be reducing the salt to 1\/2 teaspoon next time, but I will make them again because other than that they were perfect.  They rose very high, were light & crumbly, and had a wonderful consistency.","This is a GREAT recipe.  I cut the salt to a teaspoon after reading all the comments and they turned out GREAT.  You will never need another bisquit recipe.  So light and fluffy.  So quick and easy!!  I doesn't get any better!!","easy to throw together- baked up great- I made one batch as directed and the second I rolled flat- tossed on cinnamon and brown sugar and rolled cinn roll style and cut-\r\nYUMMY !","These are good!  I have never made biscuits before so I was impressed.  I was hoping they would be a tad more fluffy, but these were still great!  I always have all of the ingredients on hand so i will be making them again!  Thanks so much!","I thought I had made a mistake, because lots of reviews said these were so good, and they would have been but they were so salty I couldnt even eat one. I thought it was a typo. But sure enought I followed the recipe exactally. Even my four year old say bah too salty.","I made these last night to accompany the venison and wild boar sausage I made. Trying to give my city kids a bit of the country I guess. They LOVED them.\r\nI will say they are very simple to make also. I didn't do it exactly like the directions says to. I just kind of dumped everything in to the mixer and let it work while I did other things.","Oh, these are VERY nice and easy traditional-tasting biscuits! I made a batch for creamed turkey over biscuits and they were just great. The next time I will double the recipe to get a total yield of 14-15  biscuits and I think I'll cut back on the salt just a tad to one teaspoon per batch. Other than that, my wife and I found this recipe to be perfect. Thanks so much for posting it! pat, the old bone man","This was my first attempt at biscuits (other than with Bisquick), and I was so pleased.  I used the recommendation of the previous reviewer and cut the salt back to 1 t, and it worked out well.  I was surprised how quickly the shortening was incorporated just by using my hands.  Next time it will be a double recipe for sure.","I made the dough for a chicken pot pie and it turned out GREAT! I used butter flavored shortening. I doubled the recipe and saved some aside to make biscuits and gravy for breakfast. Lookin forward to it!!!","my second post within 5 minutes.. i read thru some of the other comments and saw that many thought the salt was too much.. i agree.. it struck me as too much as i was mixing it... i used half, 3\/4 tsp salt, and the result was fabulous... this recipe is simple. from ingredients to execution, the yield is an enjoyable biscuit.","I've been making this recipe from the KFC website for some time now.  These biscuits have become my tried and true recipe.  I make them using whole wheat flour, and they are still light and delicious.  I've added savory ingredients, like garlic and rosemary, to go with soups or other dinners.  They are great to make breakfast sandwhiches with, etc.  Love them!","Quick, easy and delicious!  My DH loves KFC biscuits and he just raves about these.  I am going to try two other variations:  one is to add some shredded cheddar cheese and the other is to add some charred rosemary for herb biscuits.","can you say WOW!? theese biscuits were wonderful and I can't emphasize that enough. I was addicted and eating them like chocolate chip cookies. These are my new dinner biscuits that I'll be making again and again! I think i'm going to go make some more :)","I've tried several biscuit recipes on this site and this is by far my favorite one. Other than useing soy milk I followed the recipe. The biscuits were light and had a really good flavor. Next time I will cut back on the salt, a bit salty for me. I'd probably reduce the salt to half. Definitely a keeper, thanks for posting.","I wish I'd read the other reviews prior to making these, as I'd have definitely cut back on the salt. Other than being a bit too salty for our tastes, they were terrific! Will definitely be making again! Thanks for posting! :)","I just made these biscuits for supper and I have to say it was the first time I've ever made biscuits from scratch that turned out this good! Even my husband enjoyed these and he doesn't usually like biscuits!  They baked up high and they were very tender...unlike any other time I've made biscuits.  They were simple to make and very tasty.  This will be the biscuit recipe I use from now on!","These biscuits were great.  I wasn't paying too much attention when making them and added the shortening before adding the liquid.  I also did not have any milk, which is odd, so I used cream.  They turned out just fine.  They didn't rise too well, but they were great nonetheless.  Thanks for the recipe.","I have always felt, as a Kentuckian, that traditional biscuits should ALWAYS use buttermilk, don't settle for anything less, even if it's from Kentucky Fried Chicken.","This is now my only biscut recipe!  They turn out so fluffy!  I have switched between using lard, and butter flavor crisco depending on my mood, lard makes them more fluffy and I think they turn out better with that, but either way they are fantastic!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!","These were good.  Finally I made a good biscuit.  I did cut the salt to 1\/2 tsp as suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks so much for this recipe.","I love this Biscuit recipe, but it far too much sodium. I will have to use this reipe with CAUTION!","these were easy and the whole family loves these!","Great recipe! I made these tonight-doubled the recipe and replaced 1\/3 of the flour with Wheat Flour. Now, there is only one left...and its mine : ) This is by far the easiest biscuit recipe I have tried. I thought the order of the recipe was odd (not adding the wet last) but it turned out better than the old standard recipe.","Love!  Love!  Love!  These are great!  I will never buy biscuits from the store again . . . who would need to with a great recipe like this one?!","Just made a batch of theses biscuits and while they were okay, I didn't find anything special about them. To me they just tasted like Bisquick biscuits. I was hoping for something lighter and fluffier. PS: as a lot of other people have said, the recipe calls for too much salt. You don't notice the salty taste if you make a sausage biscuits or dip them in gravy, but if you eat them with jam (or anything sweet) you really notice the overabundance of salt.","Loved it!","I loved this biscuit!  Everytime I have made other recipes they turn out hard but these were not.  They weren't very thick but I'm sure I must have done something a little wrong for them to be so thin.  They have a wonderful flavor and worked great for biscuits and gravy on a Sunday morning.  Thanks so much!","Chose this recipe since I was running low on butter. I got more then 9 with a cutter, but they ended up a little small. Found they work just as well if you roll them into balls and flatten them a bit, and that way you get the 9 and they'll be bigger. Only complaint I have is that we found them to salty. They've got a great fluffy texture though. May or may not make them again. Good alternate when you're out of butter.","Great flavor! I really loved the test, however they were a bit too thin. They were perfect for crumbling up and pouring gravy over, but it would have been hard to cut them to put sausage or anything inside. I'm not sure what I did wrong.","Now, this is the definition of the kind of biscuit you pour peppered white gravy over.  Good eatin'!  Thank you for the recipe!","I didn't know biscuits could be so easy to make.  I get best results using butter instead of shortening.  I make this often.  Great recipe!","easy!! easy!! easy!!\nThis recipe is easy to handle, and makes up a great looking biscuit!! The reason that I can't give it 5 stars is because they are quite salty in my opinion.  Next time I make them... and there WILL be a next time, I will skip the sugar and half the salt. \nI used butter flavored shortening... and yum, yum!!","These were good!   Mine turned out thin though.  But I had a schedule issue and had to let them sit before cooking - I am sure that is what caused it.  I used only 1 tsp of salt after reading other peoples reviews.","Yum! Very east to make and they rose beautifully. Did taste a little bitter though. Maybe needed more sugar?","The texture was good and crumbly like I like but I would cut the salt next time as i felt they were a bit salty.","Very good but at 14 minutes still not very brown. May make again and brush with butter at the end.","Just made biscuits and gravy using this recipe for the biscuits! They are delicious. I used butter instead of shortening.

I put the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl and swirl it around a little bit. I then add the shortening and milk to the dry ingredients. Mix with the dough hook until incorporated. Scrape down the bowl. It&#039;s going to be a little sticky. I put a 1\/4 cup of flour on the counter for the dough. Flip the dough around and make a 1\/2&quot;-3\/4&quot; disk. With my 2&quot; circle cutter I&#039;m able to get 6 biscuits! Perfect for my family of four. Bake for 10 min and I turn it off. Leave the biscuits in there for an additional 2-4 minutes.

I also used a bit more ketchup, 2\/3 of a cup.  I used 2 cups of boiling water from the start and added more after about 5 hours of baking and some more again later.

Tried it again a few days later adding another half pound hamburger to the recipe and were much more pleased.  Will definitely do this one again.","Fantastico!! I used two pounds of hamburger, the whole packet of Taco seasoning mix and only half of the green chilies. They were just right for my family. We topped these burgers of with sour cream and salsa. I suggest to have the sour cream adn salsa at room temperture to blend well with the warm burgers. I served the with Cajun Style Oven Fries #34011 and green beans.","A great recipe that makes 4 generous quarter pounders and is really tasty!  I think next time I will try cooking the onions first.  We loved them.","I topped the burgers with jalapeno slices rather than mixing in the chilis and enjoyed that variation.  Also topped with some cheese.  Loved the result!  Thanks for sharing.","Since I'm such a wimp when it comes to spicy foods,this is how I made these very good burgers.For the taco seasoning I used 2 Tablespoons of Recipe#105993,2 ounces of the green chilies,and about 1 \/3 cup chopped sweet onion.Mixed lightly until all the ingredients were comined didn't want to dry the meat out.I pan-fried for about 6 to 8 minutes on each side,when the burgers were almost done I added a slice of pepperjack cheese to each burger pattie.Topped with my favorite toppings,and served this with Recipe#32015 which made a great a \"Burger & Tater Night\".This will be made again,thank you for posting.\"Keep Smiling :)\"","Mexican Hamburgers added a wonderful change a pot of pinto beans and a green salad.","Delicious, thanks so much. I made these for my church and they were a big hit there and here at home.","Wonderful flavour! I made them exactuly as instructed, and added salsa on top of the burger on the bun, with some ceddar and other toppings. Cooked them on the griller machine. Delicious! Not overpowering at all , just the right amount of tingle. I made the whole recipe, we ate two for supper and put the other two in the freezer. Will be making these again, thanks for posting.","I am eating this right now. YUMMY.  I was to lazy however to make them into patties so I crumbled the burger up and fried it like sloppy joe meat and added all of the rest to ing. the meat after it was cooked 1\/2 way.  Ate it like a sloppy joe  on a bun.  THIS WAS EXCELLENT!  We ate with sliced tomato, sour cream and shredded mexican cheese blend. I will be making this again.  You can have so many toppings you can choose from with this burger!! Lettuce, tomato, all the different cheeses, jalapenos, salsa, avacado or gucamole, sour cream,  even a cheese sauce if you like mmm mmm good. thanks for posting.","I did not do justice to this recipe because I didn't have tomatoes, lettuce or onions on hand. Prepared as instructed, except I added minced onion. But it was very tasty as is. The taco seasoning gave it a kick. Will try at a later date and be prepared.","Excellent recipe!  I made these Mexican Hamburgers for lunch today and doubled the amount of taco seasoning by mistake since I have a big jar of it.  The hamburgers were still excellent, just very, very HOT!

Put it in my cookbook.  My family loved this.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.","Now this was just FUN!!  Fantastic recipe...tasted like I was at the fair.  Kids went NUTS over them and were begging for more!  Very easy to make.  Next time I think I will go all the way and make lemon shake ups too!!  Only problem I had was my funnel opening was too small for the batter...but we compromised and used something else.  They still turned out great!!  (I will be buying a bigger funnel though!!)  Thanks for the great recipe :)","I made these today and they are as great as the ones you get at the fair.  EXCELLENT!!!","Oh my Gosh!  They taste exactly like the fair.  I'm the cook of my family and I'm the fourth child of 8, so this was fun to make because i love to cook and because everyone loved them.  This was a fun recipie to make.  Here's a tip: make sure the oil is hot but not too hot, or else they might brown very dark real fast.  A way to tell if the oil is hot is to wet your figertips with water and splash the oil.  If it boils immediatly, then the oilis hot, and if it takes more than 3-6 seconds, then you should let it heat a little longer.  Good Luck and Enjoy!  Also try Lois's Lucious Layered Fudge, Recipie #55153.  Enjoy!","this tasted exactly like the ones at Knotts Berry Farm and so easy to make my kids loved them!!!!!","I must admit, I wasn't impressed.  I got nostalgic the other night, and decided that I wanted to make funnel cakes like the ones that I used to get at the fair as a kid.  I looked up this recipe.  The batter was way too thick, and wouldn't pass through my funnel, so I had to pour it from a cup, as thinly as possible.  It did not work very well, so I tried thinning the batter with a little extra milk.  That just seemed to make it thicker.  The 'cakes' turned out very thick and doughy.  I think I will try again with a different recipe, because this one was very problematic.  Sorry!","i was feeling happy so i made this here funnel cake and it was awsome.","Very good!  Just like the ones on the boardwalk.  Kids and I enjoyed this.  It makes alot-next time I will only make half the recipe.  Thank-you again for this great recipe!","These are awesome, they taste just like the ones you buy at the fair! My husband and my son loved them as well. This does make a lot of funnel cakes so I would recommend cutting the recipe in half unless you have a lot of big eaters!","This was so easy to make, and so good! I was looking for something sweet as usual, and this was perfect!  This makes so much, its still in the fridge, and I've already made seconds, and thirds, lol!","got my daughter, and beautiful grand daughter, here from PA ad I knew Kate loved funnel cake.\r\nGot the recipe, made it, and ate it, in less then 30 mins, and guess what?\r\nI am a funnel cake CHEF big time.(according to Kate :)","fabulous!the real macoy!","this was GREAT! the best funnel cake recipe i've used. as long as you use a blender to mix the batter everything will turn out great.","This recipe was great! I found it to be a tad lighter than the fair recipe which we loved because my family likes to eat on the healthier side. I had two of them and so did my husband! This is definetely a family fun favorite from now on. Thanks for the recipe!","No matter how hard I tried, I could not get my funnel cakes decently shaped. With a smaller hole, they turn out thin and crispy, with the larger hole, they were thicker and more doughy. My kids prefer the softer thicker cakes. I dusted ours with icing sugar, and they were gone within hours. Thank you for sharing.","These are surprisingly easy to make and they taste just like Canada's Wonderland funnel cakes! Unfortunatly I'm now addicted to them!","My batter came out too thick to come out of the funnel.  I just kept adding more and more milk.  I probably will try another recipe.  Flavor was good, but texture was too tough after I'd added so much milk.  ","I work at a nursing home and do the activities one thing we do is try new recipes.  The residents love these funnel cakes and look forward to when we mix up and cook a batch.  We are going to try making the dough red and make them heart shaped for Valentines Day  We put them in a zip lock bag and cut a small hole in it easier to clean up than a funnel just throw the bag away","i luv dis recipe gurl it taste really good. catch u lata iight","i already reviewed these but i just cant help but say these r fantastic!!!!!the best love em love em love em :)","Very nice and easy.  Somehow I always thought there was more to it.  I have to say it's great, we are eating it right now.  Thank you for an easy recipe that tastes good as well.","it was aful kids hate it \r\nsorry","I love it and so did my 21 month old, I didnt add all of the flour required and it still turned out so good.

He's asked me to make some tomorrow so he could take it with him to work, hahaha. Such a kid =) Thanks for the wonderful and easy recipe!","Would love saying these are just like the ones at the State Fair but\r\ncan't because the are MUCH MUCH better we used peanut oil and they came out perfect.  The funnel size\r\nwe used was had a 1\/2\" opening and it flowed out perfectly.  Extremely good recipe!","excellent","This is a great recipe, it took no time at all, and it tasted great.\n\nThanks...","As the stars say, we liked this recipe.  I believe it has great potential, it's quick, easy and satisfied a late night craving.  But as many of the five star reviews point out, it does need a little tweaking.  The flavor is bland, next time I will add some vanilla and increase the salt a little.  Also, the batter is too thick, needing more milk.  I used peanut oil to fry them since it has a higher smoking point than vegetable oil, and I mixed the ingredients together in the blender.  I used a ziplock bag with a corner cut out for pouring as there was no way the batter was going through my 1\/4\" funnel.  Rather than using water to test the heat of the oil as one reviewer suggested (that made the oil pop and splatter, next time I'll test it with a bit of batter.  That way I can adjust the ingredients as needed. Thank you for posting the recipe as we did enjoy it.","My husband, 2 sons (10 and 8), and I thought these were really good!  I followed the directions exactly.  They would taste bland if eaten alone, but once you add the powdered sugar, they are great!  My husband thought they tasted better than the ones from our state fair.  I definitely agree with one post about NOT using water to test the oil.  It splatters like crazy.  Also, using a funnel does not work.  As with another post, I used a ziploc bag with one corner sniped- worked like a charm!  We will definitely make them again!","I used this as a batter for deep fried Reese's Peanut Butter cups.  I think it would work well with Mars Bars, too.  Just in case you need more sugar, fat, and calories in your diet, and have the urge to shop for bigger pants. :)","I don't like to leave less than 5-stars for a review, so I'm not going to here.  I did think this was just ok.  It was much better after I added a bit of nutmeg to the mix and tons of Powdered Sugar to top.  It's a great basic recipe for a really awful dessert. (Why does everything that tastes so good have to be so bad for you?)  Thanks!","Family loved these.  Thought they tasted just like the fair ones.  Will add this to the \"deserts\" on our list","I saw this recipe by chance was craving them all day!  It turned out to be much easier than I expected and tasted just like the ones at the fair.  Now I just need a funnel-cake batter dispenser to make them perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!","The batter was too thick and they turned all brown and odd. Not at all like the ones at the fair.","This is most definately a keeper.  I fixed this last night for my MIL and kids and my kids are asking for it again!  Reminds me of the ones we get at OC, Md.!  Thanks!","First time making anything like this. Turned out really well and both kids liked. Super easy to make, and within the time stated.\r\nTo avoid burning them, and to check the oil temp, I squeezed a small amount of batter out and watched. They should rise to the top of the oil, and puff quickly. Thanks so much!","Very very good. They taste just like funnle cakes fron the carnival!!!","These are Very good. Just like my mom used to make for me. One thing that she did that I find VERY helpful is to take an empty ketchup bottle, clean it out really well, and use that in place of a funnel. it is easier to use, less messy, and when you dont need any more batter, just snap the lid shut! VERY easy.","This was sooooo good! thank you for the recipee!","This recipe is awesome! I made these funnel cakes and they were the best I have ever tasted. They were perfect. Lightly crispy on the outside and soft, airy and chewy on the inside. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!","AMAZING!!! Just like the ones at the fair, i did make them using my fry daddy and they are so easy to make. My family can't get enough!!!","Tastes exactly like funnel cakes I've purchased at events! My 3 boys were very happy that I gave this one a try. Thank you so much for sharing.","the batter was THICK. made me think i messed up and didn't measure the ingredients right but i know i did everything right. the batter was bland even tho i put some vanilla in it. it was really hard to get it to go thru the funnel (in my situation an empty ketchup bottle) since the batter was so darn thick. so i gave up and just dunked oreos in it and that was a hit w\/ everyone. but the funnel cake on it's own w\/ powder sugar sprinkled on it...well it didn't taste like the one's at the fair. but the kids still liked it. guess i'm still on a mission to find another funnel cake\/fried dough recipe, but thanks for sharing...family enjoyed it.","I reduced my flour down to 2 1\/2 cups plus added 1\/4 t baking soda. Fried it in oil then drizzled some chocolate syrup, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cut up bananas, finished with dallop of whipping cream, piece de resistance!","These funnel cakes came out better than the county fair's.  They were lighter and less greasy.  We fried them in safflower oil and finished them off with powdered sugar.  This recipe will make a lot of funnel cakes.  You may want to cut the recipe in half.","Everyone was right when they said it was great. It was excellent! No one else has a better recipe than this one so far. It does make about 8-10 funnel cakes. Everything came out superb. I recommend this to anyone! Thanks for the recipe, my family loves them and they do taste like the fair's funnel cakes but without the expense.","my husband has been craving funnel cake for the longest time, so I was so excited to try this recipe, and even more excited to find out how great they turned out. I also stored the batter in a clean ketchup bottle like someone suggested, and found that to be so convenient. we will def be making these again! thanks!","Everyone loved these! They are absolutely wonderful! I did not have a funnel so I used an icing bag, and it worked like a charm. I also put my powdered sugar in a sifter, and sifted a nice even layer of sugar over the finished funnel cakes.","I've made this 3-4 times already and forgot to write a review.  My husband requested these once again this afternoon.  They remind us of the funnel cake they sell at Magic Mountain.  So good and easy to make.","Yummmmmmmyyy","Very Very good!!!  I already had all the ingredients laying around....Makes a whole lot of funnel cakes!!!!!!!","SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! Great recipe but you have to constantly watch the temperature of the frying pan.","OMG!!  I have never had a funnel cake before...\r\nand these are truly light,\r\ncrispy and delicious and not greasy at all.  My daughter and family inhaled them...I got one!\r\nThank you for sharing this fun recipe!","Very good recipe. I made a couple of additions to the batter... 1 tbs of vanilla and 1\/2 tsp of cinnamon.\nI did not have a funnel so I used cherylo's great suggestion of using an empty squeezable ketchup bottle. That made this recipe such a breeze & I am able to store leftover batter for another day! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.","These turned out great!  Just like the ones I get at the fair!!  Love the ketchup bottle idea!","Very good!!!!!  Sooo easy to make.","I think this review should come from the source, so I am writing this after my wifey found this recipe. OMG!!!  I don't even like funnel cake but this was soooo good! I had been trying to talking my wife into going to the gas station to get us drinks (at 1 am) and she refused, saying she was making these. She gave me the first one and I said \"If you make me another I'll go to gas station right NOW!\"  Thank you Traci and Jeff and whoever the carni was who let this secret outa the bag! :)","I made the batter so I could bring it to my 5 year old nephew later coz he's sick. I fried up a small piece just to try it, and it was so good I had to fry up a bigger piece for me. I'm eating it right now as I'm typing this review. Thanks so much, I'm sure my nephew will love this!","This was good. I did add a little cinnamon just as personal prefernce. I think this is more than enough to make 12 funnel cakes. I had alot of batter left over. I will be making again. TY for posting.","Loved it! Tasted EXACTLY like the ones at the fair. The only thing I did differently was I made mini ones, and just used a BIG SPOON to dip into my batter and then into the hot oil. It was soooo good! Thank you for sharing!","These are fantastic..so easy to make! My kids loved them!","YAY!  I can finally satisfy my craving for these without having to go to a fair or carnival!  The batter came out a smidgen thick but added milk by the tsp. until it came out to the right consistency.  I also went to a restaurant supply store and got the largest squeeze bottle ($1.59) to make this easier and less messy.  A GREAT recipe, thanks!!!","Tasted great and I didn't change a thing! I also used the squeeze bottle idea and it was not messy.","WOW! This was really yummy. It turned out perfect. Great recipe.","This was the best funnel cake recipe I have come across!! Very good.","Very tasty and very easy.  This was my first attempt at any homemade funnel cake recipe, and my family LOVED them . Sometimes I get a serious craving for funnel cakes, and now I can fix one anytime!  Thank you so much!","I made this for Hanukkah, with great results. Poured batter into 2 small sandwich bags and before frying, cut a corner (not over the pan, because you don't want the piece of plastic falling into the hot oil). It was a little messy, but I have no funnel or spare ketchup bottle. Sandwich bags are dispensable and convenient. That said, kids loved it - it served way more than 6. There were about 8 of us, including about 4 children with hearty appetites. I was inspired to make this after having Burger King's funnel cake - sadly though, BK's funnel cake was sweeter. It was fun to make, but better left as something done annually.","Yum! came out great! I only made 1\/3 of the recipe and still wound up with 5 funnel cakes! good thing they're so yummy!","I made these and they were wonderful. I learned from a chef in a fair that the batter is MUCH better if you put it in the fridge overnight.","These were very good.  Easy to make.  Thanks for posting.","I had never heard of these before, but thought I'd give them a try because they looked easy & fun...which they were. I think my granddaughter would love them.  My husband and I both thought that they were okay, but neither one of us could ever imagine getting a craving for them :)","Delightful! Loved this with powdered sugar & a scoop or 2 of vanilla ice cream:)","OMG!!!  This was better than the fair if you ask me because, it was cheaper and you can make it any way you want. I didn't think it would come out this good. I will be making this at the next family function. I know it will be a hit!","AaaahYUMMMMMM! Great recipe, thanks! I used splenda instead of sugar and grinded more splenda to just make powdered sugar. Added just a dash of cinnamon and vanilla. Used the fry daddy and it worked perfect.","Very good recipe, but makes a ton.  We are a family of 6 and we have enough batter for tomorrow, too.  Next time I will make half the recipe.  I added some vanilla and cinnamon to the batter.  I also had to add about another 1\/2 cup milk to make the batter thin enough to go through the funnel.","tried this recipe awesome thank you","Delicious!  Makes a huge amount, so next time I'll listen to those who made this before me and halve the recipe for my crew.  The kids loved shaking the powdered sugar over these... and wearing it, of course.  Lost a star for us because the batter was way way too thick to go through a funnel, even after adding lots more milk.  Thanks for sharing.  This was really fun to make.","I decided to make these for my friend because she LOVES funnel cakes and we haven't found a recipe to stick to yet.I'm sorry to say that this isn't the recipe either. :( I personally don't like funnel cakes, but my friend thought they were o.k. She gave them three stars on taste but i thought they deserved four because they were simple directions and easy to make. They were extremely messy and the batter was really thick. Although if I could have had a bigger funnel they would had been less messy. I thought the taste was only worthy of 1 star but, like I said, I don't like them in the first place. So o.k., messy, thick batter.","They were ok...Just seemed to dry not to much like a Funnel cake ive ever had, and made WAY to much batter. but the taste was good.","Looooved this recipe! These were fun to make and tasted just like the amusement park ones. It did yield a lot though for just me and the husband. I did follow others advice and leave out some of the flour so it wasn't too thick and added some vanilla extract. I'll definitely be making these again!","Made these tonight after having a craving for funnel cake. Definitely does not taste like the ones at the fair. The batter makes way too much and it is very thick. I think 3 eggs is too much, it has a very eggy taste.","Very good duplication of flavor of the fair ground version.  Comments: Added a dash of vanilla.  I used grape seed oil because it has a high smoke point and is light.  I reduced the recipe to 2 and still had leftover batter which I saved and will try that to see how well it holds up.  I used a funnel inserted into the top of a baster tube (no bulb) for better control and it worked well.  I used a medium sized cast iron skillet which gave just the right size per cake and reduced the  amt. of the oil.  I hand whisked the whole thing which I prefer to do when possible.  There&#039;s no oil temp indicated on recipe... I started on high and reduced to med. high but this will vary according to your stove.  Too hot will turn edges dark, too low and it absorbs too much oil before browning.  I&#039;d err on the side of too little batter per fry versus too much which end up with one big, solid cake.  Will follow up with success of using leftover batter for a second round.  All in all, I thought this was an extremely good sub for commercial funnel cakes and would definitely recommend and will repeat.  Oh yes, dusted with powdered sugar just like the fair vendors do.","I honestly never knew funnel cakes are so easy to make.  And, it&#039;s just as the others have said.  These really do taste just like the ones at the fair.  I wish I&#039;d bothered to check out recipes sooner, &#039;cause I&#039;ve spent a small fortune going to fairs over the years just for the funnel cakes.","The recipe was easy to follow, batter was smooth, the funnel cake had a nice soft crunch when you bite into it and then a bit soft in the middle. The only complaint I have is that the funnel needed more tast. Maybe if I added brown sugar instead of white sugar and vanilla extract it would then give the funnel cake more tast.","Very nice and fun! Like a deep fried waffle. I increased the salt to 1 1\/2 ts and there is much more dough than for 6 servings.","Great Recipe! It brought me back to the funnel cakes I had as a child. I used a deep fryer and it worked just great. Thank you for such a great one!","Delicious. &lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;3 eggs seemed a little high, so I subbed 2 egg whites for one egg yolk; fried in canola oil. Health food!!  Guessed on temp by dropping little bits of batter in until they cooked in a reasonable time. &lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;Tried with powdered sugar on one and cinnamon and sugar on the other. Really, really good either way. Next time I&#039;m going to add a little vanilla to the batter, and maybe a little cinnamon if I&#039;m going the C&amp;S route, see what happens.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;I had a condiment bottle laying around - a messy pour, but it worked just fine.","Incredible taste, easy to make. Only issue I had was the batter was pretty thick so I had some issues pouring it from my funnel. Perhaps next time I will use a little less flour or more milk. I wish I could give it 4 1\/2 stars because the thick batter was really the only issue. Even with that, the cakes came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and nice and light just like funnel cake should be.","Needs more sugar and vanilla in the batter to be 100% but a pretty good recipe and easy to make.","We usually reserve funnel cake for Disney, but the kids requested it so I went searching. I had my ten year old make this with my supervision and it was so fast and easy. Light, not too sweet and they cook so quickly they&#039;re not bogged down with oil. The kids devoured it and I still have batter left. Hoping the batter works well tomorrow, otherwise I&#039;ll be forced to eat all if the cakes next time.","Great recipe, I actually used it to make zeppoles by dropping tablespoons of batter into the oil and then tossing them in a paper bag of powdered sugar,","Great recipe. The only thing I would change is to add more sugar to the batter. It didn&#039;t turn out as sweet as I thought it should be (compared to the old fair funnel cakes..from what I remember). Then again, I haven&#039;t had one in years. But other than that, this recipe is very tasty. Also, it came out crunchier than I expected. Maybe I left it in the oil too long. I did about 3 mins on each side so if u don&#039;t like it as crunchy, I would shorten that time. Thanks for this yummy recipe!!","Way too thick. It would even go into the funnel. So I added 1 cup of very warm water and mixed it again. After that though it came out perfect and just like the fair.","Okay! I did not have a funnel and I cut this recipe in half (I only had two people eating funnel cakes and still had a LOT OF leftover batter!) I used a sandwich ziploc and just snipped the tip of a corner! This recipe was very simple and VERY tasty! Only issue I had was I squeezed the bag too hard and got batter EVERYWHERE. lol lesson learned: get a funnel!","This was just OK, batter was a little heavy and it really didn&#039;t have much taste.","I just made these... followed recipe to a tee! Very bland, and dense. So disappointed.","This is great !! It was so good and the batter was perfect !! Thank you for sharing with me your recipe !!","Just recipe. The batter just swelled up right away as soon as it hit the oil. Got my kids excited just  to end up throwing it all in the trash because the inside was nothing but a gooey mess. I absolutely do NOT recommend this recipe.","Love that I can now have funnel cake whenever I want with this recipe :) It&#039;s so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand. I made a slight mistake and poured the wet ingredients into the dry (not the other way around as stated), which made a big clumpy mess :S However, a little extra milk smoothed it all out...Thanks for posting the recipe!","Greatly disappointed. They were rather blase and flavorless. Even added cinnamon and vanilla to give it some flavor and it still didn&#039;t work.

I used skinless boneless breast but followed your recipe (cooking time was shorter).Great blend of flavors that complimented each other perfectly.  Thanks Dancer for another great recipe","Mmmm Mmmm good.  The marinade is very flavorful - I liked the currant jelly and the ginger especially. I used a nice Valpolicella (medium dry) red wine in this.  I let it soak in the marinade overnight.  The thighs came out very moist and tender.  The one thing I would do differently next time is to make an extra batch of marinade to serve as a dipping suace, because I enjoyed the flavor so much.","Nice flavor!  I had some boneless, skinless thighs in the freezer and decided to give this recipe a try and it was a success. I made it as it. Everyone enjoyed it but since we aren't huge thigh fans I think I'll try it out on some breasts and see how that turns out.","I made this last night and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The thighs were tender and juicy and the marinade\/basting sauce had wonderful flavors.  I made it using orange juice instead of chicken broth and I think I'd like it even better with the broth.  The sweetness of the marinade needed some saltiness to balance it, and the broth may have provided that.  Next time I'll try either the broth or a bit of soy sauce.  I'll be making this a lot, and can see using it for a great appetizer with thighs cut in chunks and skewered before grilling.  I, too, would make an extra batch of marinade to use as a dipping sauce.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.","Absolutely delicious!  My wife and I both loved it.  I did it exactly as the recipe directed, using orange juice. Next time I am going to try it with cornish game hens.","Great flavors going on with this chicken.

I then added the juice from the orange I used for zest.  I don't think it affected the end product much though and it had a very nice orange flavor.

Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t think to reduce the cooking time, with the result that the meatloaf was a bit blackened around the edges (the dog enjoyed those bits with his dinner). The gravy was excellent (I messed up the directions, but was able to salvage it). I would recommend this recipe unreservedly, with just a word of warning about the cooking time. We really enjoyed it!","This turned out amazing. I added 1 tablespoon of mustard and only used a half of an onion in the meatloaf and it was outstanding!

She picked this one out and we happened to have pretty close to the ingredients on hand.  We used a can of biscuits for the dough and also turkey bacon and reduced fat cheese.  We made two pizzas in 9-inch round pans.  The whole family enjoyed them.  We give this recipe a 5-star review for ease and great taste.","This was a beautiful, tasty dish.  I served it with fresh fruit.  One word of caution, don't bake it on your pizza stone unless you really mound up the dough on the edges.  Oh, well, I needed to clean my oven anyway.

I also used an Italian cheese blend in addition to the cheddar and sprinkled some sweet basil, oregano and parsley on top. I made one with whisked eggs and one with whole eggs (an over easy egg pizza) and they were both great, thanks!","My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I crumbled some Bob Evans savory sage sausage and browned it in a pan.  In addition, I also added chopped red bell pepper and green onion along with shredded Colby and Monterrey Jack cheese-which was sprinkled on the crust with the sausage. I baked mine in a 13 x 9 inch baking pan and lightly sprayed it with oil before placing the crescent roll in, which was very helpful.  This is a fun, tasty recipe- thank you for sharing.","I had some leftover pre-made pizza crusts so made this for DD and I for brekky but didn't mix it all as I was worried about it dripping off the bases.

I can't leave a recipe \"as is\".  Call it a family trait - but I always have to add a little of this or that to make it my own!

I made this dish two nights in a row because my husband loved it so much (and didn't leave leftovers).  On the first night, I made the chicken according to the recipe, except, I stuffed the chicken with the whole slices of bacon, instead of crumbled bacon.  For the sauce, I used the bacon grease instead of the oil and substituted flour for the cornstarch.  It had a good taste, but was too thick.  On the second night, I followed one of the other comments and wrapped the chicken with bacon, in addition to placing bacon inside the chicken.  OK, so my husband was in hog heaven (no pun intended).  As for the sauce, I doubled the amounts for the sauce and it came out much better (go figure).  Wonderful recipe...highly recommended!!","Really easy.  Very good too!!!!","This was excellent and very easy.  I used Monterrey Jack instead of cheddar because we like white cheeses. Also, I pounded out the breasts and folded them to make a pocket instead of cutting them.  Very quick and delicious!","Just made this tonight.  It came out so good!  Followed other suggestions by pounding out chicken and putting cheese and slices of bacon in the middle, then folding it and wrapping it with bacon.  Also, added a splash of white wine to the sauce.  Came out amazing!  Thanks!","Wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly, except, I only had shredded cheese.  I really had to shove it into the chicken and secure it really well, so it didn't fall out. This was very yummy. Everyone really loved it. Kids had seconds.","Oh! I.ve triesd it for 2 times and it's so good. First, I just tried a couple of breast to see what it gonna be. Then I let my kids and husband taste it, they all love it. Then my kids ask me to cook again for they really love it. Then I cooked again on our family special dinner.

I'll definetely make it again but next time, I'll add more spices or maybe coat it in some cornflake crumbs.","I made this dish and it was delightful!  I did use more cheese.  I used a full slice of american cheese inside of each breast and it turned out great!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  This is a keeper.","Soooo Good! I used mozzrella instead of cheddar and it still turned out wonderful. I will be making this quite often now. =)","This is so good. I would use a little more cheese next time- can never have enough!","These were very good. I used provolone instead of cheddar as a personal prefference and they turned out great! Thanks for posting!","I just made this for dinner and it was great. I used what I had on hand which was Boursin cheese (garlic and herb). I pounded out my chicken breasts spread a good amount of cheese on them and rolled them up. I then wrapped bacon around each roll. Salt and pepper and the rest is the recipe. I did triple the sauce as I was serving this with mashed potatoes. It was a hit with everyone.  Thanks!","Hi - this recipe was wonderful.

We wrapped the chicken breasts with the bacon, as some advised, and baked it in the oven not making the gravy, since our family isn't into gravy.  The paprika added nice color but not much flavor -- I'll probably add more next time.  And we dumped a LOT of shredded cheddar on top, as well as loading the insides of the chicken with more than the recommended amount of sharp cheddar.  Very tasty.","Love, Love, Love this recipe.

This is the exact recipe that I used to make with my grandma and sister. We always put the coconut on top and didn't have much trouble with them falling apart.","The other day I went to get in my car.  Lo and behold there was a baggie on the hood of my car filled with some bakery.  So, I took the baggie off the hood and got in my car.  Needless to say, when I was driving I devoured all of the bars. They were phenominal! I knew they had to be from my neighbor, so when I got home, I ran like a wild woman to her house.  \"What were those bars that you left me?\" I begged.  She said, \"Seven Layer Magic Bars!  If you want the recipe, I can get it from my friend.\"  I thanked her, but refused, because I knew that one quick trip to Recipezaar and I would have the recipe.  And I was right!  They are so good that I'm afraid to make any more, because I'm trying desperately to loose weight, and with these in the house, my will power will be gone!

Rich, and just pure HEAVEN!!! My neighbors thank you, too! ;) :)","This is a great recipe that my family has made for as long as I can remember. The only difference that I do is that I press the crumbs into the melted butter to form a crust and I save the condensed milk as the last layer that is drizzled in an even coating to bind the other ingredients as well. This is very addicting! Next time I am going to try this recipe with chocolate condensed milk.","I dont know where you got this recipe but I hane had it for 2 years. It  matches mine to a -tee its sooo yummy I make it more than often. I got mine out of the Joy of baking cooking cookbook the Christmas of 06. If you havent had it yet you should try it. Its great","Whenever I am invited to someone's house, this is what I am told to bring. So yummy! I also sprinkle white chocolate chips and leave off the nuts since people can be so finicky :) I also pour on the sweetened condensed milk right before I pop it in the oven. I would watch the cook time because the edges tend to cook real fast and then it's a real hassle to cut because they stick to the side of the pan. Maybe greasing pan first would help? I will try that next time.","Awesome- a salty and sweet, chocolatey and sugary treat.  My husband and I made these together- fun and easy.  I've had these before, and am so glad I found this recipe so we could make them ourselves!","This is the exact recipe I use!  The only thing I do differently is drizzle 1\/2 of the sweetend condensed milk over the crumbs, and the other half over the top of all the layers.  That way you don't have to press down at all, it just sticks together.","This is exactly what I was hoping it would be.  Very sweet.  I didn't use the aluminum foil and it was hard, but I got out the bars ok.","Good recipe...everyone loved it","these were really good. I didn't have nuts so i added honey nut cheerios and topped with nuttella. I was expecting something totally different when i made them. Looking for that recipe from a childhood memory. this wasn't what i was looking for, BUT still a keeper! very yummy and gooey. i loved the flavor. Thank you so much!","Very Sweet, VERY good. Used toffee pieces instead of butterscotch,arrowroot cookies instead of graham crackers,wish i would have read more of the reviews before as pouring half of the sweetened condensed milk would have made it stick together better, YUM!","What a classic recipe.  I've always loved these, and as a result, DH just discovered them!  Thanks for the reminder of a tasty, comfort food sweet!","These tasted good and were easy to make, but they were messy to eat.  They were gooey and did not cut nicely into bars.  I'll try the recipe that includes a \"substantial crust\" next time.","These were amazing and simple. You can make some small tweaks to suit your own taste, too. We've made it subbing caramel for butterscotch, and we've used slivered almonds for the nuts, too. You can mix and match how you want. Just make sure you get the Condensed milk spread evenly. My first time making it, I didn't do this so I had some spots harder then others and some soft, When I made sure it was even... no problem. Also, pressing it all down firmly is IMPORTANT. If you don't press it down, the top layers won't be &quot;stuck&quot; to the bars. I almost forgot this step, but remembered as I was putting in the oven..

Followed recipe, except added more cheese to top of peppers before baking.","These are awesome peppers, Karen.  They are a snap to make and oh such good comfort food.  I made one addition, and that was some garlic, and I used a good quality fat-free cheese.  The cheese gives these peppers a great taste and texture.  Definately a recipe that I will be using again.  I made enough to freeze BTW.  Thanks for sharing.","Very good. \r\n\r\nThank you","I really enjoyed these. We did think that there was to much rice so I will cut back next time. I also added a couple of cloves of garlic.\r\nThanks for posting!","I've been craving peppers, and these were easy and good.  I used one red and one orange, DH doesn't like green.  I always have precooked ground beef\/onions, and precooked brown rice in the freezer, so that shortened the prep time.  Instead of the tomatoes, I used leftover sauce from last night's Tex Mex Pork Chops by Millie.  It's salsa and chopped chilies, so the peppers had a kick.  Since I was only cooking two, I cooked them in my toaster oven with perfect results.  Definitely a keeper!","the peppers are great and easy to do.  The only thing I did differently was use a 10 oz can of ROTEL diced tomatoes with chiles, 1 6 oz can of tomatoe paste and 4 more oz. water instead of the 16 oz can of tomatoes.","We loved this dish.  I always buy peppers from a discount club and end up wasting them.  What a wonderful way to use them.  Our 2 year old to our 68 year old Uncle enjoyed them.  Can't thank you enough for a great recipe.","I used red pepper from the market. Followed the recipe as written. What I really liked about this recipe & why I choose it. Was that it did not include \"tomato sauce\". We enjoyed them very much. Thank you Karen this will be our \"Stuffed Pepper\" recipe from now on.","Sooo much better than my regular recipe for stuffed peppers!  I used 2 14oz cans of Zesty Chili Recipe tomatoes, 1 1\/2 cans in the recipe and half the can on top of the peppers just for looks.  I love the taste of the filling, the cheese already in it, and the fact that it's not as greasy as when you cook the meat in the peppers.  These were just wonderful!  My husband's only complaint was not enough rice, so next time I will double the rice.  Thanks for a great recipe!  It's replacing my old one, that's for sure!!","Excellent recipe, I have always made stuffed peppers with tomato sauce, and this was a very nice change. Because our DS's aren't fans of stuffed peppers I dressed theirs up to look like monsters with asparagus as antennas, pimento stuffed olives as eyes and left-over pepper tops as tongues, I'm a mom that allow my kids to 'play' with their food, if it encourages them to eat!\r\nThank You, Karen from Colorado!","Oh, I loved these!  The extra meat and rice mixture spooned around the full bell peppers made the dish look incredible.  I love stuffed bell peppers and these will definately be made frequently in my house!","Made these tonight for dinner and all loved them! I doubled the rice but other than that made exactly the same! Thanks! Will make again!","Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I think the cheddar cheese is what makes it so good. It's very easy to make (even one-handed while holding one baby while the other clings to my leg...) I'll definitely be making this again!","Very, very good.  Easy and quick to make.  This one was actually better the next day.\r\n\r\nE from LA","Fantastic!! My husband and I loved this... thank you!!!!","These were delish !!!!! My hubby loved them and asked to have them again tonight!Sorry for the rating delay. Thank you for posting !!!!!!","I just finished making these.  Although I used Taco seasoning in with the rice mixture, for a little extra spice. Loved 'em.","This was a big hit with my daughter and me.  She even ate them cold for a late night snack.  Thanks.","Great recipe!!! Easy and great looking.\r\nThanks","I really enjoyed the taste! I had problems with the filling making enough for 6 large bell peppers. I had large peppers, but not enough filling, guess my peppers were extra large? My peppers looked large to me. I really enjoyed the taste although. I was just bummed it did not fill all my peppers.","I was worried about adding the rice to the cooked beef mix and I did have to add more water, but it turned out great!  Next time I may just cook the rice on the side and mix in with the beef to make it quicker.  Everybody loved it.  Thanks.  ","Ok, can you stand another 5* rating on this recipe? :) I've been using this recipe for years now and I love it. Dh isn't much of a fan of bell peppers, stuffed or otherwise, so I stuff one for me and bake the rest of the stuffing in a separate pan for him. In place of the cheddar cheese I use 6 slices of Kraft American cheese, torn in small pieces. For me, this is comfort food at it's finest.","This is a keeper!!! Thank you for sharing it.  It was very easy to convert to vegetarian as well.  I just added Boca crumbles to the recipe after cooking the onion, peppers and tomatoes and rice.  I can't wait to make it again. DH loved it served with smashed potatoes and that tomato gravy.","Made this tonight for supper.  I doubled the recipe for the stuffing and used only four bell peppers.  Also substituted seitan (which we make here at home from gluten) for the ground beef since the family is vegetarian.  Used 14 1\/2 oz cans of diced tomatoes, and half cheddar\/half mozzerella for the cheese.  Blow me away terrific!  I served it with twice baked potatoes, onion bread that I made and berry cobbler for dessert.  There is lots of leftover stuffing for when the kids get home, and a pepper apiece for the wife and I for lunch tomorrow.  Is it lunch time yet?  Next time I will add extra water, and use brown rice, and there will definitely be a next time.","This recipe was awesome!! This was my first time to make stuffed green peppers.  I took more than 40 minutes to prepare, probably because it was my first time.  My husband and 10 year old son LOVED this recipe.  I am making them again tonight!","This is great. I have a very similar recipe, but have always used 5 slices American cheese (torn up) in place of cheddar.  Never thought of using cheddar, and the addition of hot sauce sounds wonderful. I'll definitely try it.","This was great. I wanted to try the recipe and made it expecting that my husband (who had a stuffed pepper about 30 years ago and didn't like it) and my son, (who doesn't care for ground beef outside of burgers) would just tolerate it. They rated it good and very good and I loved it. I used fat reduced cheddar, some Italian seasoning and chopped up half of a zucchini that would have headed for the compost bin in a few days. Cut large green peppers in half as per another reviewer's suggestion. Enjoyed leftover half today for lunch.","I probably should have added garlic and other spices as recommended by others.  To me it was very bland.  I used brown rice and the times just didn't cook it enough--it was too firm.","family loved it","added some garlic, otherwise fantastic","Thanks for submitting this! I made it  tonight and it came out wonderful! Seasoned with Mrs Dash, and we layered extra cheese between scoopfuls of the meat mixture...absolutely great! will make again!","This recipe is sooo good. There are just a few alterations I made to our taste. I use orange and yellow peppers instead. I use ground turkey instead of ground beef and I use mozerella instead of cheddar. Thanks so much for posting, this has become one of my favorites!","\"Its a party in my mouth\" is how my daughter put it!  The first experience for both her and my husband for stuffed green peppers and it was a hit.  I used fresh diced tomatoes and some canned salsa to spice it up.  Delicious!","Pretty good recipe...got it from my old 1976 better homes and gardens \"new\" cookbook! : )  I actually had a can of tomatoes with green chilies, so used that instead, plus added some garlic powder and didn't boil the peppers first since I wanted them slightly crunchy. I used 2 large bell peppers, then put the rest of the filling in a small casserole for my husband who doesn't like peppers. Thanks for posting!","This was a great recipe for very basic and tasty stuffed peppers.  Definitely could add in your own flavor if you like more spice or something other than just ground beef (like mushrooms or seafood).  I also recommend only boiling the peppers for closer to 2 minutes, just to sort of open them up rather then getting them totally soft.","Delicious!  This has become a regular in our house.  Even my picky 6 year old eats it enthusiastically.","Just made this for lunch with the following revisions - I used orange, yellow & red bell peppers, added 6 shallots, 3 cloves garlic, about 1 teaspoon Greek Seasoning, 1\/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1\/4cup Dale's Seasoning, a little extra water and about a teaspoon of tabasco.  This was absolutely rock solid delicious!  Best stuffed peppers I've EVER had!  Thanks!!!  If you're looking to kick it up a bit try my revisions, you won't be disappointed!!!","Great peppers! I used a can of Garlic and Olive Oil Petite Cut Tomatoes, and this is funny... instead of brown rice, I used whole wheat thin spaghetti! It was too late when I realized I ran out of brown rice, so I took half a box of thin spaghetti and cut it into little pieces with my hand and used that instead. Recipe still came out delicious! My BF was impressed! Oh, one last thing... I only used about 1\/2 cup of cheddar cheese. Trying to cut back on the fat! I bet with MORE cheese it would've been better!","This was fantastic.  (Cheese really does make a difference!)  I added ginger soy sauce, some hot sauce, and used rinse water from the can of tomatoes for the water.  My husband and I inhaled them.  These are a must-try!","Great Peppers ! I stuffed red, yellow and orange for milder- sweeter taste for my girls. I did add 1 can of tomato sauce to the recipe and used med grain not long on the rice. Will make again for sure- cooked in my covered Pamperd Chef dish- came out great !\r\nThanks for sharing.","It's August as I write this, when produce is abundant from the garden and farmers' market, and I chose this recipe as my template for stuffed peppers, which I've not liked in the past. This 5-star recipe stood out by adding the leftover meat mixture to the baking pan.   \n\nI used homegrown tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil, and cooked the rice separately, as I didn't trust the 1:1 ratio for rice:water. I added local cheddar at the end of baking, just because that's a familiar procedure. Now I'm about to taste the results\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\nIt's wonderful, a real meal, and you don't feel like you're forced to eat a whole bell pepper; it's the shell for all this other good stuff. The pepper tastes deeper and more flavorful than almost any other way you can use it. This is excellent simple food, a gift of love to family and friends.","This was sooo good.  I must admit, I made a few changes based on ingredients I needed to use up.  I only had 3 bell peppers, but they were HUGE, so I still ended up using almost all the meat mixture inside the peppers.  I added 2 really big cloves of garlic.  I had garden tomatoes to use, so I peeled and diced those instead of using a can of tomatoes.  I cooked the rice separately since I knew I wasn't going to have the liquid from the can of tomatoes.  I doubled the Worcestershire, and I did not use the cheese due to my husband's allergies.  This turned out so well!","Great healthy recipe, with the trade of white rice, for brown  rice.  A few shots of Tabasco added a little heat.  I especially liked the canned tomatoes, due to the fact that I am trying to eliminate HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, which is in so many products.","Excellent recipe - very simple to make and delicious.  I substituted Gorgonzola cheese for half the cheddar to give it a little extra kick, but it's good either way.  Thanks for sharing!","This was very good.  I did not add in the chopped peppers but instead saved it for another use.  I also needed to add a little extra water to cook the rice mixture.  My husband said he doesn't usually care for stuffed peppers, but really liked these and that is saying a lot!","Wow.  Hubby and I agree that these are the best stuffed peppers we've ever had.  As a last step before baking, I mixed a little bbq sauce and Frank's hot sauce and spooned that on the top, then put a bit of shredded cheese over each pepper.  They were delicious.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.","This is awesome!  Everyone had seconds at our house.  I didn't have regular canned tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I cut the peppers in half lengthwise and stuffed them that way.  I used sharp cheddar for the cheese.  My husband asked me to please put this in recipe in the rotation.  Thanks for sharing this great dish!","Very tasty recipe!  I only made a few revisions due to not having some of the ingredients in my pantry--two 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes and minute rice instead of long grain rice (adjusting the cooking time accordingly).  I added a few things--two minced garlic cloves, one chopped jalepeno pepper and extra cheese for topping each pepper before baking.  It was a delicious, tummy-warming comfort-food style meal.  Thank you!","This was great! Before using this I hated stuffed bell peppers. I had the intention of making it for my DH and eating something else but this was too good to pass up. Try it you won't be sorry.","This was a very tasty recipe!  I did add about 15 to 18 drops of tabasco and 1\/2 cup more water as well as someone else.  I also added a 4 oz. can of hatch green chilis!  I would recommend this recipe to all of my friends!  I'm going to try it next time with ground turkey.","I made these just like the recipe showed.  I did not have enough ingredients for 6 large bell peppers.  The ingredients were barely enough for four.  Maybe I over filled them.  The taste was good, but one large bell pepper stuffed was a lot and almost became too much by the end of the meal.  Thanks for sharing.","Very good recipe!  I agree that there needs to be more seasoning.   It was a bit bland.  However, I will certainly make this again.  Thank you!!!","Excellent!  I used browned sausage (removed from casings) instead of ground beef, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.","Thank you for this recipe.  I love it because it takes me back to being a little girl.  I was looking for a stuffed pepper recipe similar to the one someone near and dear to my heart used to make.  This one is very close!  I frequently make these peppers  to take to work for lunch.  They are just a good re-heated.  The only adjustment I make is I season the meat with season salt and black pepper in step 4 and then in step 5 I increase the salt to 1 1\/2 tsp.  This is truely a comfort food!","This is an awesome recipe. My husband loved it and its super easy. I used orange, yellow and green bell peppers for a colorful presentation. Thanks for a great recipe!!!","this recipe was awesome!  Even my little ones ate it up.  I also added a little Tabasco and it gave it a nice kick to it.","I loved this recipe. I substituted rice-o-roni for the long grain rice, and it tasted great!","A great pepper recipe! My hubby loved it. I did add some garlic powder and used sharp cheddar. It is a definite keeper!! EXCELLENT! Update 2\/25\/09-made again.  I am not a big stuffed pepper fan, but I love the filling. This is such a keeper and company worthy recipe.","These were really good.  My only regret is no one else in my family will eat stuffed peppers so I don't get to make often.","I found this recipe in early January, 2009.  I have made it at least every other week.  My husband can't get enough of it.  Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe!!","I thought these were great.\nThey freeze well too.\ni did add some extra sauce for them to bake in.\nThanks.","The stuffing for these peppers is perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I do like my stuffed peppers to be saucy, though, so I added a can of tomato soup on top and a little more cheddar cheese!  I'll use this recipe from now on with the addition of tomato soup and more cheese!","Very tasty recipe.  I did add 1 tsp of hot sauce (I do like spice).\n I cut the peppers long ways - they cook faster and I  did not pre cook them.  25 minutes in 375 oven and they were perfect - still had some crunch to the peppers and totally hot through. Used Lite Havarti cheese.  Thanks for a very enjoyable recipe","We love this recipe!  I added some extra tomato sauce to the top and sprinkled with a little extra cheese, but other than that I made it according to the recipe.  I've made this twice so far, because we all really liked it, even my 3 kids.   I will make it over and over.","This was simple and good. I am using long grained brown rice, though next time I may use instant because I ALWAYS worry about getting the rice done enough. I also added a little ketchup into the meat mixture. This was soley something I like, and does not have to be done to make these taste good. I also added a little ceyanne pepper. (sp) We like spicey around here!! All in all a very good recipe. ALSO, the rice did not get tender enough with the 1 cup rice per 1 cup water, even with the juices from the canned tomatos, so if you are using long grain rice, add 1 cup rice per 2 cups water regardless of the juices from the tomatos, I am re-cooking the whole mixture because there was not enough water to make the rice tender enough to go into the oven.","Very, very good.  Preparation instructions were spot on and I like that the peppers are whole instead of halved.  The filling is fantastically flavorful and juicy as is.  I have also tried adding some shallots and spicier peppers to the filling as well as using sausage instead of ground meat but the bell peppers are mild enough and there is enough filling that it still didn't have much kick.  If you like spice I'd agree with the other reviewer who suggested putting hot sauce in with the meat.","My family loves these.  Sometimes we use the cheese, other times we don't.  It just depends what we have on hand.  We also love to use green tabasco sauce on them.  I have to stir the rice fairly often, otherwise it burns a little at the bottom of my pot.","Thanks, these were great! Though I microwaved my peppers instead of boiling them. I also used ground turkey and Rotel & tomato sauce instead of ground beef and tomatoes.","Fabulous recipe just like it's posted, though I did sprinkle some cayenne into the stuffing mix for a little extra kick.\n\nTry omitting the shredded cheese and serving these with crumbled bleu cheese on top instead.  Divine!","Great recipe,Karen! I used a can of crushed tomatoes, omited the cheese ( DH is trying to diet! :) ) and upped the rice to about 2\/3 cup. I also use a can of Healthy Choice tomato soup mixed with about 1\/2 can of water and poured that over the peppers, as we like a little \"saucier\" stuffed pepper. Thanks for posting this, it's a keeper!","This is a very delicious dish as a meal.   I do not like green peppers so I used yellow peppers.  Also I added chopped celery to the onions.  I also used ground round beef.  I substituted brown rice for the long grain.  I am a diabetic and these substitutions were just perfect for me as a meal.\r\nI thoroughly enjoy this web site because there are hundreds of recipes that I am able to substitute certain ingredients to make them diabetes friendly!","This is a wonderful recipe, I used a little more water, and I used tomatoe sauce instead of canned tomatoes, I also doubled the worcestershire sauce and added fresh black pepper.  I will make this again, my family loved them.  Does need extra seasoning, fun to play, garlic would be good too.","Cindy was right, these need a little more flavor.  For a Southwestern touch, you can add a McCormick Chili mix (Hot or Mild) to the meat during mixing.  But just to make them taste better, use Tony Chashere's Cajun Seasoning to the mixture before stuffing.  Careful, use it instead of salt, and a little goes a long way, but it really is great.  Or you can use Emeril's Cajun seasoning.","Made this dish last night for me and my husband. Neither of us had stuffed peppers before, so this was a treat! Made a few changes: used ground turkey instead of beef, did not pre-cook the peppers (we like a bit of crunch left!), and added rosemary, garlic powder, and Chipotle Tabasco. I followed the recommendation to add more water, but I added a bit too much. I was able to remedy that by using a slotted spoon to drain the meat mix while filling up the peppers. It's great topped with cheese, sour cream, and some diced green chilies on the side. Will definitely make again!! Can't wait to try it on the grill instead of the oven for the summer.","I took all comments into consideration before preparing this meal. I noticed that you all agreed that it needed a little more of a \"kick\" so with my recipe I added a shot of cayenne pepper and a little spaghetti sauce. OMG, this dish is delicious - by special request of my husband, we are having it again tonight!","I just made this tonight and it was awesome!  I didn't have any white or long grain rice so I used a box of Uncle Ben's Broccoli and cheese rice mix.  I also added a medium sized diced zucchini and a half a bag of frozen corn.  I could hardly keep my husband and my brother out of the mixture so i could stuff the peppers!  I beef mixture is great even by itself.  I had some left over and no more peppers, so I boiled some shells and stuffed them and popped them in the freezer for a quick meal later!  Delish!  Thanks for posting!","Fantastic & easy! Made this with yellow & red peppers to make a more colorful presentation. Incredible with ground turkey instead of beef!","This was a good starting point recipe.  Do to my unpreparedness, I had to make some changes and created a new version of this classic.  One big change was I used ground turkey.  Those come in 19-20 oz. packages, which was good since I had eight peppers (some red and yellow too).  I took the tips from Cindy and added about four shakes of hot sauce into the meat mixture.  But I went a bit further (since my family likes it kicked up a notch). I added two tablespoons of chopped green chilies (canned) too.  I also like the idea of mushrooms I saw in another recipe.  So I chopped up about a 3\/4th cup and added it to the meat mixture as well.  I had instant brown rice (not the long grain) so the simmer time was reduces to only 10-12 min.  Other than that the only other addition I made was topping it with more cheese.  Since I had more meat and eight peppers, I did increase the other ingredients a bit - but the measurments were not too specific.  The results were amazing - my friend and family are clammoring for more.  I'll add this one to my favorites.  Enjoy!","I have to agree ... these are a little bland.  I added green chillies to them like suggested ... but they are still missing something. Thank you but not a do over for me .. sorry","Very delicious. I was used to eating my grandmother's recipe my whole life and they were a bit on the bland side, but good. These are similar but so much more tasty. I love the addition of the cheese to the meat! I did do as someone else suggested and mixed a half can of water with a can of tomato soup and poured that over before baking. Mmmm.","Yum!!! I cut out the cheese and had to add a little water so the rice would cook. I also added tomato soup w\/ a half can of water over the top of the peppers. Delish!","I made a few changes to the original recipe..added chilli powder to the meat when I cooked$, a whole onion instead of a 1\/2, a few diced carrots, and some hot sauce after all the ingredients were mixed together. It could have used a little more kick but still yummy. I also made 1\/2 the recipe without the meat and just hot sauce...Also, yummy.  I had lots of leftover filling so I baked it in a silicone bread pan and it turned out great. My 17 month old son loved this-Great way to get your kids to eat veggies!","I used Churizo sausage instead of beef to give it a little spice and 2 large fresh tomatoes instead of canned because I needed to use some up before they went bad.  It was excellent!","Very tasty!  I put a layer of tomatoe sauce on the bottom of the baking dish befor putting in the peppers and the poured some over the top.  Thanks for such a good recipe, I have been looking for a recipe for peppers like these for years and my search is now over!","Excellent recipe!  we've already made it twice within a week!!","This is my new favorite recipe for stuffed peppers. The only thing I did different was to add some fresh herbs:sage,dill, and thyme. I also added some harrisa which is a hot paste. After they were finished cooking I uncovered them and put about 3\/4 cup cheese over the top and put back in the oven to melt. \r\nThis is the best recipe I have tried so far and I don't think I will try anymore.","I made this last night and loved it!  I did add some corn to it also.","I just made this tonight and as with the other reviewers, I added some fresh herbs.  I did not, however, use any cheese.  It is very good!  It does need some spice, hot peppers, tobasco or some such heat.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I also used green and red peppers and the taste of the peppers comes through nicely.  Yum!","Bravo! These are soooo good!! I'm lazy, so didn't boil the peppers before - just prepared everything, stuffed the peppers and baked them for about 45 minutes. Mmmmm good!","I made this last night and it was delicious! I had to double the recipe because we had a lot of peppers ready from the garden. I used ground turkey instead of beef, used tomatoes from the garden instead of canned tomatoes (just used a bit more water than the recipe called for to substitute for the missing juice), more worchestershire sauce, and more cheese, which I mixed between cheddar and mozzarella. The main reason I made these changes was so that I wouldn't have to go to the store for one or two items, and the doubling of the batch was a last minute thing. I also added extra seasoning when the mixture was simmering with the rice (an herb mixture that I use on chicken a lot). I loved them, and boyfriend said they were amazing. We only baked four of the ones we stuffed and froze the remaining ones for later use. The blanching of the peppers really cut down on the baking time, and they peppers were so tender, but not mushy. I will def make these again.","WOW! These are the best stuffed peppers I've ever had! (even better than my mom's!). I actually had to use a winter squash to stuff everything into because I cut into the peppers and all but one were bad :( But the winter squash actually turned out to be wonderful and my husband just raved! I doubled the worcestershire sauce (personal pref) and sprinkled seasoned salt on the squash and subbed seasoned salt for regular in the meat mixture. The squash was really big, so I just sliced it in half lengthwise and put it face-down on a cookie sheet, poured a little water around the squash and baked it for 25 minutes at 400 degrees. Then I stuffed the squash and followed the rest to a T. YUMMMMM! I will definitely be making this one often!","LOVE THEM!  I've made them with chicken, with ground beef, and with Morningstar Crumbles, and all three variations were delicious.  My family loved them too!!!","These were delicious!The stuffing was very tasty but it was too much pepper for me.Next time I will cut the pepper lengthwise and have one half for one serving.","I rarely give a negative review, but this is one that our family found to be quite bland. I even upped the worcestershire sauce after tasting the mixture before baking and it still was bland.","5 Stars for the sheer versatility.  You could really make this with any seasoning you like to give it an Italian\/Cajun\/Mexican\/Asian\/Etc. inspired taste.\r\nI normally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjust recipes off the bat, I usually make them first and then the second time, adjust.  But in reading other reviews, and looking at the ingredients, I could surmise that the flavor would be lacking as there is no additional seasoning.  \r\nMy variation came out fantastic  - Husband said he had always stayed away from stuffed bell peppers as they were bland, gross and too much pepper.  Well, he loved these, ate the inside, the peppers and even went back for a second pepper!  A staple that will be added to my roster of pretty easy weekday dinners.\r\n6 Medium Peppers (2 Orange, 2 Yellow 2 Red)  - save tops to equal about 1 cup diced\r\n1.5 Ground Beef\r\n1 Whole chopped Yellow Onion\r\n1\t14.5 oz can Diced Tomatoes\r\n\u00c2\u00be Cup Basmati rice\r\n\u00c2\u00be Cup Water\r\n1 tsp Mediterranean Sea salt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c course grind to taste\r\n1 Tablespoon Lea and Perrins Worsteshire Sauce\r\n1\u00c2\u00bd Cup Shredded Kraft Sharp Cheddar (Fine Shred)\r\nHeaping Tablespoons Minced Garlic\r\n1 Tbsp San Francisco Seasoning (Spice Islands) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c About 1 tablespoon total\r\n1 Tbsp Louisiana Style Cajun Seasoning (Spice Islands) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c About 1 tablespoon total\r\n1 Tbsp Red Pepper Flakes (Spice Islands)  - About 1 tablespoon total\r\n\u00c2\u00bd Cup Shredded mozzarella for tops\r\nFollowed the recipe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I chop the Bell tops to equal 1 cup, I add the garlic and about half the SF\/Cajun\/Red Pepper flakes with the mixture.

I used ground turkey in lieu of the ground beef, still tasted great. Thanks for sharing!","I have used this recipe hundreds of times and it never gets old!! I have modified it a bit to suit the needs of my household. Since I no longer eat ground beef, I use ground turkey meat which tastes exactly the same and is a lot leaner. I use two cans of Rotel instead of the canned tomatoes (one spicy and one mild). Also for more added flavor, I use Mexican style rice and Mexican cheese mix. This is a big hit in my house. I love it and will continue to make this for years to come!!!","The peppers were wonderful and enjoyed by all the eaters. \r\n I tasted the mixture before stuffing and felt it was a little bland so I added some Smoked Paparika adn Italian Seasoning. That did the trick. Thanks for the recipes.","Add mine to the rave reviews of this.  I have never had such wonderful stuffed peppers, just as they should be but to often aren't.  Not only the flavors, they can be changed as people like but the technique.","Super delicious! I added two cloves of garlic, a tbsp. of fresh rosemary, a pinch of crushed red pepper and topped off with Italian breadcrumbs. Ridiculously delicious.","This was lovely.  A bottle of Hot sauce on the table allows everyone to personalize.","yum! I would have given this 5 stars...but I too had to add water. I think next time I'll cook the rice separately and then fold it into the meat mixture to ensure it's cooked properly.\nThanks for an easy and delicious recipe!","This is the 4th stuffed pepper recipe I have tried on this site - and it was the best one yet.  I used a cup of water instead of a half - and used some mexican tomato sauce for flavor on the tops.  It was VERY good - Thank you Cindy.","Don't know what it is, but I never use rice for bell peppers.  I topped them off with some mashed potatoes and baked it.  Very good.","These were awesome. I ended up using about double the rice and water, as well as adding in some italian seasonings... all topped with some pepper jack cheese. Yum!","This is such an awesome recipe...I don't change a thing. My husband says these are definitely the best he's ever had. It's just him and I so I always have some left over. I freeze what's left for a quick meal it's second time around. I've made these several times already and I know I will continue to do so. Thank you for sharing!!!","I'm going to have to try this again.  It's yummy, but mine turned out a bit liquidy.  I used mozzerella.  Thanks!","My family normally doesn't like stuffed peppers and even I always found them bland in the past. This recipe is wonderful!! Everyone loved it! I added a little more onion and some garlic to the mixture and when I served it I put hot sauce on the table. Again, it was soooo good!! I've already done this recipe twice, Thanks!! PS One time I stuffed a tomato with this mixture and it worked well also!!","Excellent!  My alterations: red and orange bell peppers instead of green; chicken instead of beef; minced dried onion instead of fresh (less dried onion than is called for with fresh); Italian stewed tomatoes instead of plain diced tomatoes; mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.\n\nTwo thumbs up from very picky DH!!!  It's going on my permanent rotation!\n\nBTW, it takes at least 50 minutes just for cooking rice and bake time.  Then add prep time and browning meat.\n\nRed & orange bells make it a sweeter dish!  Absolutely superb!","I make it a little different, to where I cook the rice ahead of time and mix it in with the meat, along with about 2 tsp. of Italian Seasoning.  I also always use ground turkey and make a few with tofu for the vegetarian in the house.  They are delicious!  Sometimes, I will even put a slice of provolone on the top of each pepper, yum!","These are great but I absolutely prefer them w\/o the cheese.  I feel like the cheese overpowers the delicious flavors and they end up tasting like cheese.  I add a little tomato sauce, garlic powder and onion powder to the ground beef mixture. Thanks Cindy!","This is will be a go to recipe for me from now on. It was easy to prepare and my kids enjoyed it. The only adjustment I will make next time is adding some extra spices to it, as some of the previous reviewers have.","I added extra seasoning by using garlic, parmesan cheese and italian seasoning.  I also swapped out the cheddar cheese for mozorella.  All in all pretty good, I can only imagine what it's going to taste like with red peppers next time.","Loved the recipe, but had to change up a bit.  Next time I will pre-cook rice, (rice was not thoroughly cooked), and add corn.  I added 8-oz. tomato sauce, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 tsp. sugar, 3 tsp. of worcestershire sauce, topped with Italian bread crumbs.  Yum !!!!","Very nice and tasty recipe.  The only change I made was I used a can of tomatoes with chiles.  Gave it just a bit of heat which was very nice.  All enjoyed and have requested that I do this again and soon.  Thanks for a great new stuff pepper recipe.","These were good - I did use precooked rice and left out the water, also added dried garlic1 T sugar, Italian style diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce and 2-3 times more rice than called for.  And some corn off of a leftover cob that I had in the fridge.  Topped with some cracker crumbs that I had leftover.  I think next time I will use sausage instead of hamburger though.","Even though I am not a pepper lover, I have made this recipe several times and really like it. Yesterday I cleared out my garden and had a dozen small peppers, so used all of them for this recipe. Now I have 6 in my freezer for a quick meal later.  I replace the cheddar cheese with 3 cheese Mexican, and it adds a little zest to the recipe. This recipe is definitely going into my loose leaf cookbook!","Loved this recipe, used Yellow Rice &amp; added 57 sauce, I used some Pico de Gallo for my mixture too!!","These were very good.  I had some large green peppers and knew I was going to make stuffed peppers with them.  I chose your recipe and am very glad I did.  I doubled the meat ingredients, filled the 6 (very large) peppers and put the remaining mixture in a casserole.  We loved these.  The peppers were nice and thouroughly cooked.  Thank you for sharing we will use this recipe again.","Easy, simple, yummy!!!  Would definitely make again.  I forgot the chese, but it was still good.  I also parboiled the bell peppers anywhere for 1 - 3 minutes (flipping them over in the middle).  I did not add the bell pepper trimmings this time, but I would next time.  DH loved them too.  Was surprised at how easy they were to make.  Oh, the rice was a little uncooked (maybe I used the wrong kind?), so I would cook the rice at least half way next time, too.","I have made this recipe quite a few times now, and it is my favorite way to make stuffed peppers! I was a little hesitant the first time I made them, because I am used to having mine slathered in marinara sauce, but these always come out so moist and delicious, that I now prefer them this way. I always substitute the ground beef with ground turkey. They come out amazing, every time!!","Added extra rice about half a cup, 1 tsp cilantro and I precooked the rice.","I've made these so many times and forgot to post my review. Quick and Easy!  I added more tomaotes and a dash of seasoned salt.","Made as written and they were good. Next time I made them I used 1\/2 beef and 1\/2 sausage and i used 1 can of rotel tomatoes and chili's. topped them with colby jack cheese! They were great! thanks for posting. will make often","We grow bell peppers in our garden, and this was a perfect recipe to enjoy them. My family loved this recipe! Thank you for posting a keeper!","Great recipe!  These were nothing like the stuffed green peppers I grew up with--and that's a good thing!  I love that the peppers are parboiled and keep a good texture and flavor.  The filling is yummy as well.  My family loved this!  Definitely going in my tried & true file.  Thank you!","Got this same recipe out of the Better Homes and Garden cookbook many years ago and have been using ever since.  I use canned diced tomatoes with oregano, garlic, and basil instead of adding dried spices.  Also use minute rice. Turns out great!","I added spicy rotel in place of the diced tomatoes. I also added some chopped jalapenos and a few tsp of hot sauce. We like things spicy around here.","This is absolute comfort food.  My best friend's sister made these for our dinner party, and they were yummy!!!  And...I have one for lunch today, so this makes me quite happy!  We added a bit more worcestershire sauce in lieu of extra salt, perfect! Thank you for the great recipe!","im not going to rate since i didnt follow directions very well lol, i just checked the ingredient list and started, not realizing that you cooked the ground beef before stuffing the peppers, but the flavors were wonderful! I mixed everything and baked a bit over an hour.","Excellent!  We have had this twice recently and it was GREAT both times.  We will have it many, many more times!","These peppers were a huge hit in my house! I was amazed how much my family loved them. They were easy to make and had the perfect flavor. They were also a very pretty and colorful dish. I made them exact to the recipe but added a bit more cheese and a tad more water. The only problem was I didnt make enough! :D  Next time, I will have to make more. I ate one pepper and it was very filling. Thank you for an awesome recipe! :)","I really enjoyed this entree.  I did put in 1 cup of precooked rice instead of a half cup of dry rice and added a tablespoon of minced garlic, and a little oregano and basil.  I filled 4 Bell Peppers completely, 6 wouldn't have been full, but maybe my peppers were really large.  Everyone in our house enjoyed this dish a lot and we'll make it again.","I've made a number of stuffed peppers over the years and these are by far the best.  My DH who doesn't like green peppers and usually only eats the stuffing, ate the whole thing.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.","I have made this dish many times, now, it's a staple in our house when we want something extra nice! I add a little spice as well, and a tiny bit of brown sugar to offset it and it's lovely!<br\/><br\/>One thing that I do to save time (and dishes) is, when the ground beef and everything is cooking in my frying pan, I steam the peppers by inverting them and placing them on top of the ground beef. I leave them there for about 10 minutes, and voila! Perfectly steamed peppers!<br\/><br\/>Thanks for sharing!","Absolutely loved this recipe! I especially like that after cutting the tops off of the peppers, they were diced up and added to ground beef along with the onions! I used red, yellow and orange peppers, because we do not care for the green. I HIGHLY recommend cooking rice separately. So since I did cook rice separately from the ground beef, I omitted adding the water to the ground beef mixture. Therefore, just heating it about 10 minutes to heat the entire mixture once the tomatoes added.  Also I used our favoite Uncle Ben's, long grain wild rice w\/broccoli. After rice cooked I just added it to the ground beef\/onion\/pepper\/tomatoe mixture, then threw in the cheese and then stuffed my peppers. I had alot of the rice\/beef mixture left so I did as another suggested and spread in the baking dish along with the peppers. This was soooooo good! Thanks for sharing.","YUM!  One comment -- parboiling 5 minutes made them a little too well done for me.  After I saw how much they'd cooked, I plunged them in ice water and they were fine. Next time think I'd only cook them about 3 minutes and then check.  Like them to be cooked but still firm when all finished.  After reading another reviewers input, I decided to go a little bit South American, so added Saizon seasoning mix and sofrito to the onion, pepper, beef mix. Gave a great flavor.  One other thing I changed was that I added 3 T Nuefchatel (cream cheese) to the cooked beef\/tomato mix and stirred. Then added in cooked rice (used more than in recipe) and some cooked quinoa I had on hand.  Gave it a great creaminess without the heaviness of too much cheddar.  I sprinkled just a bit of cheddar blend on top of each one at end of baking, and we thought they were perfect.  Thanks for posting... don't know why it's been so long since I made stuffed peppers. Will definitely add them back to a more regular spot on the rotation!!","This was delicious and easy!  I made several changes due to what I had in my pantry\/fridge.  I used 1 lb ground seasoned chicken, 1 small yellow onion, 1\/2 cup of green pepper and  added 1\/4 cup of fresh parsley and a touch of garlic salt.   For the cheese, I did 1\/2 cup mozzarella and half cup of grated parmesan.  I did not have tin foil, so I put 2 inches of water at the bottom of my baking dish.  In the last 5 minutes of cooking, I put 2 tablespoons of sauce over each pepper.  During that 5 min, I put 2 more tablespoons of sauce into an empty bowls and served each pepper on the sauce.","Very good! More water needs to be added to the mixture, rice was not cooked even after 20 minutes.","Prepared these for my DH and myself this evening for supper - I am not a fan of stuffed peppers, however, DH loves them so I fix them occasionally.  That being said, I will fix these in the future for both of us as I finally found a recipe that I even like.  I did have to alter the recipe a bit as I didn't have any onions, so in place of the onions I chopped up some celery and mushrooms - used red & yellow instead of green peppers and doubled the cheese (you can never have too much cheese :) ), I also used diced tomatoes with green chilies and added about 1\/2 teaspoon hot sauce.  Excellent flavor with just a bit of a kick.  Thank you Cindy for finally giving me a recipe for stuffed peppers I'll look forward to making again and again.","These were delish! Like other users, I found that I needed to use more water and cook longer to ensure the rice was done (maybe about twice as much of both); however, I also used risotto, which could have made the difference. Other substitutions included ground chicken instead of beef, and tomato sauce instead of tomatoes (just don't like 'em!). Based on others' comments about blandness, I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and more salt than was called for. Definitely was not bland! Served with some nice crusty baguette. I will have to try some of these other creative additions next time.","My family loves this recipe!!!!!","Following someone else&#039;s advice, i added quote a but more salt to bring out the flavors. Also added Chipotle Tobasco sauce. Abt a tablespoon I guess. It turned out so amazing. YUM YUM. too bad ground beef doesnt photograph as well as it tasted! :)","I absolutely love this recipe! I am exploring food.com because we are tired of eating the same ole routine foods! This recipe was a hit I changed a few things slightly instead of using uncooked rice uncle Bens make a microwaveable cup of rice(I was working nights and had to go no time to wait on the rice to cook), I added a little more cheese, onions, and bell peppers  into the mixture. And topped it with cheese this recipe is a sure winner and will be added to my rotation. Even as a leftover it was fun to eat! For my 3 year old the stuffed peppers were a little too much for him so I just gave him the filling and his plate was clean! Thanks I am always looking for new recipes for my little guy do to multiple food allergies!","Totally great recipe. Very easy. I only used 4 peppers.I also added 2 teaspoons of tobasco sauce to the meat mixture per Cindy Hartlin's suggestion. I used brown rice (half boiled in the water used to blanch the peppers before adding it to meat mixture)instead of long grain. I also topped the peppers with another 2\/3 cup of shredded cheddar.","I hated stuffed peppers as a kid, but I loved this! Instead of mixing the cheese in, I sprinkled it over the pepper tops.","Everyone loves this with a few minor changes. I added two large minced cloves of garlic and a tsp of beef bullion granules. I increased Worcestershire sauce to one Tbl. I added more cheese to top and put about a 1\/2 inch of water in the bottom of the pan. Covered tightly with foil I baked for about an hour for rice to completely soften. My husband said to keep this recipe with changes!! :)","Excellent base recipe! I did find the filling to be a tad bland, so I followed a few of another reviewers suggestions and added garlic salt, onion powder, and more Worcester. I also used a can of hot rotel in place of the tomatoes and it provided plenty of kick. I had to keep adding water as the rice absorbed it to keep it from sticking to the pan and to let it cook completely. I also used red bell peppers rather than green. They&#039;re just a slight bit sweet, which goes great with the spicy filling. Great base recipe to build on.","Flavor wasn&#039;t too bad but the rice was crunchy when following the recipe as it is written. Next time I make this I will definitely kick it up a few notches by adding a little more seasoning and precooking the rice.","I liked this, but I also made changes.  Otherwise I think it would have been terribly bland.  I added 2 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp cumin.  We liked it and I will make again.","These were very good and meaty.  Will make again!","These are absolutely delicious! I used a can of diced Italian style tomatoes instead of regular ones, which added a little bit of pep. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a &quot;T&quot; ..... fantastic! Thanks!","Very tasty!  Was loved by DH, kids and grands!  Increased this to serve 8 but other than that prepared as posted.  Thank you for sharing!","I also changed to the ro-tel tomatoes, and added garlic salt, onion powder, basil, Italian seasoning, a banana pepper, a little tomato sauce, and sugar and pre-cooked the rice a little.   My husband said these were the best stuffed peppers he had ever had!  It didn&#039;t seem like they were going to have much flavor without the extra seasonings, so I&#039;m glad I added them.  Excellent!!!","These days I&#039;m a little hesitant to rate recipes because I don&#039;t ever follow them exactly, I just find the one that suits me the best and then I use it merely as a guide line. This recipe is the one I used as a guide line for dinner last night and I was really pleased. Instead of canned tomatoes I used a mixture of tomato sauce and ketchup...some Worcestershire sauce...some garlic powder...some Italian seasoning...I browned the meat with some dried onion and fresh garlic...I used a microwave pouch of rice...You see where I&#039;m going here...but this is the first time I parboiled the green peppers per your instructions and I was like &quot;Aha!&quot; this helped a lot! Also I used shredded parmesan both in the mixture and on top. Thank you for this recipe!","Lovely dish.  I haven&#039;t had this in ages.  As a little girl, I don&#039;t remember liking this. Thankfully, my taste buds have matured, as I found this incredibly tasty.  Personally, I would have give this 5 stars, but I was outvoted by my family.  Thanks for a great recipe..I will no doubt be making this again!&lt;br\/&gt;Update 9\/7\/14:  I used grated, fresh cauliflower in place of rice to make this more low-carb friendly and enjoyed the texture that the cauliflower gave to the dish.  I simply added the cauliflower along with drained diced tomatoes and left out the water...and baked according to recipe.  Enjoyed it very much!","This was awesome! Increased the rice and water to 3\/4 cup. Added half a beef bouillon cube, red pepper flakes, doubled the chili powder, and heaping amounts of Sazon, Adobo, and fresh garlic. Used a Mexican cheese mix as well. I love spicy! Came out awesome. Might try it again with some black beans added in. Thanks!!","This recipe was great! I pre-cooked a flavored rice though. You don&#039;t even need to stuff the pepper. The filling was great by itself.","Good recipe, not as good as a Greek version I make (I will soon post). The rice never fully cooked even after simmering in the skillet for longer than directed. I also preferred the mixture before the cheese was mixed in. Next time I will pre cook the rice and just top the peppers off with cheese during the end of cook time. Oh and I used an assortment of red, orange and yellow peppers instead of green (because green are my least favorite).","Easily a crowd favorite. My family licked their plates clean and it had the house smelling delicious! I substituted Orzo instead of rice and baked it with the peppers resting on a bed of pasta sauce. So delicious.","This is a good, but basic recipe. I like using 1\/2 ground beef and 1\/2 ground spicy Italian sausage. I&#039;ve even added ground veal when i can find it. I&#039;ve also have used or so pasta instead of rice and added sliced mushrooms and black olives and topped with Italian cheeses.","We really enjoyed these bell peppers. I precooked the rice and while the mixture simmered, I simply added about a 1\/2 cup of water to keep it moist. It all worked out perfectly. My husband isn&#039;t a fan of cheese, so sometimes cooking gets a bit creative in our home. In this case, I filled his peppers before adding the cheese to the rest of the filling and everybody was happy.","Was delicious! Changed a few things when I made it but they were fantastic and I&#039;ve already shared this recipe with others.","Only change I made was cooking Italian sausage instead of ground hamburger. I also cook 2 pounds of meat and end up with a decent amount to freeze for next time. Huge hit in my household!","I actually tried to dress this recipe up, but it didn&#039;t help.  All three of us were thumbs down on this.  You could barely find the meat in it, and there was absolutely no test.  I would not recommend this recipe.","This recipe was delicious!  I cooked brown rice in advance and just mixed it together with everything before stuffing the peppers.  Also, I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes because that is what I had available.  I will definitely make again!","It was a bit too mild for my tastes, so I added some medium taco sauce as a topping.  Very good.  Next time, I will add the Rotel.","Me and fiance both loved this! I cooked the rice for about 25 mins. Still wasn&#039;t fully cooked but the oven finished cooking it. Also, my can of diced tomatoes had zesty green peppers in it :) would be good to add queso fresco on top.","I finished the meat, vegetables, and rice for 20 minutes after saut&eacute;ing the ingredients first, adding the chopped tomatoes, etc. The organic long grain rice didn&#039;t finish cooking ( still hard), so I decided to simmer it for another 15 minutes. Hopefully, it will be ready by then because I already have my oven preheated to 350&deg;. I have a gas range and oven. Was the recipe cooked, and baked in an electric range? When I tasted the mixture to assure that the rice was tender, it tasted great, but the rice was still hard. My range is high end, and I was cooking the ingredients on the Ultra Power Burner. All the liquid had evaporated, which would have been fine if the rice would have been ready, so I switched it to a regular burner after adding a little water. It was starting to stick. Let&#039;s see. I&#039;m an experienced cook, and I realize that recipes sometimes need tweeting depending upon ingredients used, and range\/oven differences. Also, I live in the Midwest. Also, I have a home in the tropics, and weather conditions can vary results. I think that the recipe will be fine once the rice is ready, and the baking is finished. Let&#039;s see!","Great recipe! I have people who are on a no-carb diet in the house, so I completely omitted the rice, which resulted in less cooking time on the stove. (If you choose to do the same, no need to add water into the filling.) I used more Worcestershire sauce and sprinkled extra cheddar cheese on top of the stuffed peppers prior to baking. That&#039;s an easy and great main course right there! Five stars!","Rice was definitely not cooked at the end. I would recommend boiling the rice first. Other than that, they came out great.","I followed this recipe exactly as it was written and it was excellent! Just uncovered and turned the broiler on for about two minutes at the end to brown the cheese! Delicious!","Ended up using left over mince from tacos and adding in sweet corn, chopped mushrooms and chorizo. Delicious!","Great recipe!  very easy to follow and make.  I added a bit more salt for my liking and I also added the rice a bit earlier then said on the directions.  I read the reviews before I started to cookl and they said that the rice wasn&#039;t cooked all the way.  So I let the meat brown, then i added the rice with tomatoes and onions.  That gave the rice a bit more time to cook.  It all turned out awesome.","The best stuffed peppers I have EVER had.  I followed the recipe except used garden tomatoes diced up, I used chicken stock instead of water, added 3 Jalapeno peppers and some hot sauce.   These will be the only ones I make and great for summer when you have lots of bell peppers.","absolutely delicious! changed it up a bit though and added a few swigs of tapatio, and a healthy amount of spice mix i had on my shelf (onion, garlic, chipotle pepper, red pepper, jalapeno and ground ancho) left out the Worcestershire sauce and added some lime juice. I cooked my rice separately, then added it to my meat mixture.  :)","This was awsome! I never really liked stuff peppers but I love this. I added a few things. I added taco seasoning and corn and black beans. My husband who is Mexican loved it. I made my own salsa and guacamole to put on top of them too. So good!!","I used organic brown rice and quinoa pouche instead of rice. The rice and quinoa is  precooked with additional seasoning. Added finely chopped brococoli and carrots for nutrition. My picky husband liked it?","Fantastic. Just finished a dinner of these. Wifey says this recipe is a keeper. I found the filling was just right for 3 1\/2 peppers which is great cause there&#039;s only 2 of us.","First time making stuffed peppers. I&#039;m very new to cooking anything! Been at it only a few months. Strong recipe.  I made a few modifications to mine to suite taste - \n\n1. Used 1 teaspoon of soy sauce instead of straight salt. It gave some additional flavor to the meat with less salt.\n2. Instead of chopped bell peppers in the filling. I used chopped serrano chillies. We like our food very hot!\n3. I Added 2 teaspoons minced garlic to the filling.\n3. After baking, I topped with a spicy maraneria sauce and Mozzarella cheese and placed back into thr oven until the cheese was melted.\n\nI FINALLY got cudos from my guy for my cooking. He said it was the best I have cooked to date. Usually he throws away my left overs... Tonight he packed the left overs for lunch tomorrow!\n\nThank you for your help!","I switched up and used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic...basil...and oregano....and some sharp cheddar I had in fridge ....also used red, yellow nd green peppers came out great will definitely make again.","Delicious, but I added fresh garlic mixed with cooking the beef, onions and chopped peppers. I also used diced tomatoes with chili peppers as I didn&#039;t the regular tomatoes. Both ingredients were a wonderful addition.","Very blan. I was hoping better I&#039;d give it a 2 out of 10","Like another reviewer I have also made this recipe for years.  The recipe was in my Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.  It is the best recipe I have ever found for stuffed peppers.","I hate being negative but I found this dish quite flavourless and (sorry) very boring. It definitely has potential with a serious adjustment to the spices used and their amounts. The dish need not be spicy but it does have to be flavouful and unfortunately, this one missed the marked.","I made this recipe and my family loved it even my picky teenager.  I didn&#039;t save it unfortunately and I have been trying to find it and now I have.  Trust me this is one you will make over and over remember to SAVE IT!.  It&#039;s easy to make, tasty to eat, and beautifully appetizing.  I am made them for a potluck dinner last weekend and they were a big hit,  Top them with a little parsley and finely diced tomatoes.  Yumm ? a must try","Perfect recipe! I use red and yellow peppers instead","Love how these turned out, i wanted them to have more of a Mexican flavor so I added some red enchilada sauce and a bunch of cheese. Love this so much!","Tasted awesome except rice was not all the way done. I even added more time and more chicken broth instead of water for rice to cook. I used turkey instead of beef. Yum! Will cook again but precook rice I think.","I am glad this recipe taught me how to blanch the peppers, but aside from that and reading all the reviews for how to liven it up, this recipe was not great at all.  As other reviews suggested, I used precooked rice. I tasted the meat mixture before stuffing the peppers and was very disappointed. I added some garlic and a TON of taco seasoning to try and spruce it up. Even after that, it still felt like it was missing something. Good try but it was very boring as the original recipe.","This was very good. I used Rotel tomatoes, and my rice was still a bit crunchy, so next time I will be cooking the rice seperately.","I made these using Rotel tomatoes 1.5 cans using the original and the mild. I also added Mexican cheese in the dish. Before placing in the oven I sprinkled cheese on the top of each one. They were great.","I didn't have ground beef, so I used ground turkey and just added more seasoning. I also had to use a bit more water for the rice to cook thoroughly. I also added some chopped jalepeno peppers and a dab of hot sauce. and some grape tomatoes. First time ever making stuffed peppers and I think they turned out really well","This is my go to base recipe for stuffed peppers. I give it 4 stars only because it doesn't have enough flavour. To the rice mixture I add some extra seasoning - italian blend, dried basil, fresh cilantro, some pasta sauce, a bit of sugar and a healthy dose of sriracha hot sauce. I have no problem with rice cooking, but I will also note I use 19oz can of tomatoes, which may give the rice the extra liquid to cook. I love to make this at lunch and pop it in fridge till supper time for an easy meal later, so this would be great to bring to a family potluck and just pop it in oven when you get there!","This turned out great!! I'm hooked! Thanks for posting this quick, easy, and satisfying recipe.","I made this today for the first time, I improvised on the recipe. I used some leftover Spanish rice from the other night. I added dehydrated onions and garlic instead of chopping them up. I used petite diced tomatoes 14oz. I also added in a little frozen corn. Cooked it 30 mins covered with aluminum foil. Then I took off the aluminum foil and turn up the heat to make the cheese a little crisp. Next time I might make with Ground Turkey to lower the calorie content.","Delicious! I used one of the adaptations I read and added fresh chilli and rosemary to give it an extra kick!","All I did was just add a bit extra water and juice out of the 24 oz. can of diced tomatoes, the rest of the tomatoes I froze. Added season salt, steak spice and pepper. next time I'll add more salt.","These were delicious! I added many more seasonings that the recipes states while cooking the ground beef in the skillet because I prefer well-seasoned food (i.e. Soul seasoning from Shoppers, garlic powder, garlic salt, season salt, etc.). Also, I incorporated both mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese in the beef mixture and on top. **Helpful hint: Make sure when you arrange the peppers on the baking sheet before putting them in the oven, that you pack them tightly side-by-side or else they will tip over. A couple times while they cooking I had to open the oven and reposition them, which all could have been avoided... Although this may have only happened before I packed so much beef mixture into each pepper. I wanted so much of the deliciousness in one serving! :-)","I added a tin of tomato paste mixed with water. This made the sauce thicker and a very nice tomato flavor. I also added some additional spices.","I love stuffed peppers...the ONLY NEGATIVE is that it says use uncooked, long grain rice. I did and they were very UNDERCOOKED. Please precook your rice or are we supposed to use Minute Rice?","I have made these twice and they are wonderful! Both times I used the exact ingredients and &quot;eyeballed&quot; the measurements. I would highly recommend mixing the cheese into the rice\/tomato\/meat mixture near the last few minutes of the simmer. It really helps the peppers not rely on just the cheese on the top :)","Good recipe, but they tasted bland to me. They need more flavor.","These didn't turn out as I'd hoped they would, they were soggy when I pulled them out of the oven. The tomato flavor was a little too over powering for my taste, I won't be making these ever again.","One of my favorite recipes. I did change it slightly. I precook the rice, and use brown rice, and then skip the water. I used 2 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce, and add 1 tsp. of chili powder, which makes a huge difference in flavor. I don't mix in the cheese, and only top the stuffed peppers with cheese. I used seasoned diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano.","Great, basic instructions. For the rice, I used 1.5 cups water instead to thoroughly cook rice, put toothpick holes at bottom of peppers to avoid over saturated peppers with fat juice, and added spicy black beans with corn to add flavor. Everyone was quiet at the table!","All time fav , for those of you fussing about the rice not being done it's right on front of you , just see and test for doneness, times are always approximate with rice","Got everything ready and realized there wasn't any diced tomatoes.","I used 2 lbs of meat (1 beef, 1 sausage) so I also added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce. I knew I'd like it better with more seasoning so I also added onion powder, minced garlic, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. I put the cheese on top instead of mixing it and I cooked for 25 mins and then finished with 2 mins under the broiler.","It was a hit.","My husband and I both loved them...I did add 2 cloves of garlic minced...also added a little cheddar cheese to the tops...I'm also going to add the Italian bread crumbs under the cheese next time...these are a keeper...","Did the recipe change? I've been using this one for a few months and my boyfriend loves it. But I recall adding the rice directly to the meat mixture before, not having to cook it separately...","Great recipe.","In the last five minutes when putting the cheese on them do you cover them back up?","Used Mexican rice and spiced it up! Turned out great!","This turned out so GOOD! I added Italian sausage with the lb. of ground chuck beef and Chinese Chili Sauce to it while it was cooking. I only stuffed 4 bell peppers (for 2 people) and have lots of leftover to either eat alone (it's so tasty) or freeze and stuff some bell peppers another day.","This recipe is a winner!","I microwaved the peppers instead of boiling them, about 3 minutes on high, way easier. Added a minced lg. Garlic clove in to my onions and peppers when saut&eacute;ing, used ground Turkey instead of ground beef, and frozen riced cauliflower instead of rice. It was ridiculously easy, fast, tasty and healthy. Even the kiddos loved it.","I made this last week The only thing I made different was I baked the peppers for 30 minutes in the oven it was heavenly mmm","I pretty much follow instructions I use microwave Spanish rice though and when baking stuffed peppers I wrap loosely in foil. I bake for about 30 min then unwrap and broil for a couple mins with shredded cheese on top Turns out great.","Omg I'm so excited to makes these.....","I tweaked the recipe by adding a medium salsa, and topping with 5 blend Italian cheeses, pizza seasoning and scallions. It is absolutely DELICIOUS","A good basic stuffed pepper recipe that lacks a lot of flavor. I should have read other reviews before making this. I added sour cream and hot sauce as I was eating it and it helped a little. If I make them again I would definitely recommend adding garlic, red pepper flakes, salsa, chili powder, cumin, or other spices.","Excellent recipe! Super easy. DH and picky 7 year old daughter loved it too. One of the best stuffed pepper recipes I've ever had! Thanks for a terrific recipe!","Made them a few times now. Big hit.","my gosh this is my first time to make this for my husband and it turn out so yummy. it is now his favorite. I just made some changes by using ground pork and the cheese i used was parmesan &amp; romano.. try it to belive it.well so far im trying a lot of recipe from this site and i never get dissapointed. cant wait to try more recipe!","In the directions, the third step is to &quot;cook the whole green peppers...&quot; This is hard to do at this point, since the first two steps revolve around making the green peppers not be whole any more.","Second time around. Used seasoned yellow rice instead of white rice (more flavorful). Will definitely prepare more often. Also recipe instructions do not say what to do with the cup of water. Figured out it needed to go in the baking dish.","Made it, loved it! Easy if you use one pot to boil the peppers (transfer them out to cool), cook the rest of the items in the same pot after you drain all of the water. Very easy; will make it a regular menu item.","Made these and were awesome. Used ground chicken in place of beef, so tasty.","I changed a few things as well. I followed the suggestion of adding three tsp of Worsteshire sauce. I also added according to taste paprika and cumen. I doubled the rice (maybe that's why I felt the need to add a lot of seasonings) which I cooked separately, but it filled perfectly in the peppers. I did add a bit of milk when I thought it dry. Lastly, I topped it with a sprinkle of crushed garlic bread crumbs and melted butter.","Today is the 2nd time I have made this recipe.....I used a packet of taco seasoning only omitting the sal in the recipe.....They were delicious!!!!","I always bake my stuffed bell peppers in a bundt cake pan. It works nicely by keeping them upright, regardless of the funky shape of the bell pepper. Of course, you can never find the nice flat bottomed peppers when you're looking for the perfect shape to stuff. I always end up with the most difficult shapes to stuff and stand. The bundt pan makes it a non-issue. Also, my mom always put about a quarter inch of water in the bottom of the baking pan to keep the peppers from burning on the bottom. It works great that way, but sometimes I kind of like the crunchy bottoms.","We love it,it was so easy to cook not much time.my dinner was the best my husband love it","AWESOME!!! I cook the rice separate.. Great quick meal","Cook time not long enough. Peppers were not done enough for me.","Im not a bell pepper fan but, my family loves them. I made this with a few changes based on what I had on hand. Used brown rice left from another recipe, added a small can of tomato sauce and a bit of ketchup to increase the tomato taste. Also, lined each pepper with a slice of pepper jack cheese (cheddar would be good too) then added the beef mixture on and top and baked 25 min. Topped with another slice and returned to the oven for 5 minutes. I loved the idea of boiling the peppers before hand as that really perked up the color and crispness of the peppers. This is definitely a keeper as it was such a hit with everyone!!","The recipe was good I added my own twist to it and it came out very good and tasty","First time making them and I gotta say they came out very very good...but I did use a few different ingredients tho..instead of the canned tomatoes I used a jar of Pincante sauce which gave it some really good flavor and I didn't have to cut any onions or alot of extra bell peppers cuz it already had it in there and then I added a half of can of corn and aside from just adding salt to the inside of the peppers I added a lil garlic powder and last but not least I made sure my rice was well seasoned with butter a lil salt and pepper and once again a lil garlic powder...I know that seems like alot of seasonings but if you use in light moderation they won't be over powered..my co worker's fell in love with them..will be making them again real soon!!","I like spicy foods so I sprinkled cayenne pepper and chopped jalapenos n he ground beef,otherwise I followed the recipe which was great.","This is my first time making them. My mother in law always makes them. So I said, why not! Give it a try. I just put them in the oven. I will be putting hot sauce on mines when they are done.","I used this as a basic starting point for my first stuffed peppers. My boyfriend had been talking about wanting them and I'm not a fan of green peppers. I made them with red and yellow peppers and my boyfriend said they were the best stuffed peppers he's ever had! Instead of diced tomatoes, I used rotel with chilies, added minced garlic and put garlic salt inside the peppers. It turned out wonderful and has now been added to our weekly menu! Even my 11 year old liked it! Thanks!!","These will come out of my oven in 10 minutes, I too adapted the recipe. My husband refuses to eat rice, so I substitute it for about 3\/4 cup of Garlic &amp; Herb Bread Crumbs (you want the mixture to be moist when combined). I also used a can of Basil, Garlic, Oregano Diced Tomatoes. Plus poultry seasoning, kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. To make 8 instead of 6 add 1# of ground sausage and a an 8oz. can of Garlic, Basil Tomato Sauce. Follow recipe and enjoy!","My dad (a chef) did things slightly different. He 'blanched' the peppers to soften them so that they would not break when stuffing. He also made a rice and ground beef filing first. You can add spices and other ingredients as you please. He then would take the uncooked ground beef and rice mixture and gently line the inside of each pepper and fill the bottom of the pepper to about 1\/4. He then placed a large piece of WHITE extra sharp cheddar (use Kraft Vermont or other but it must be white). He finished filling each pepper with the raw beef and rice mixture. The poured about 1-2 TBSP of pasta sauce over the filled pepper and then placed another thick slice of white cheddar on top of that and pour more pasta sauce over that. He cooked it in the over covered for about 50-60 minutes where the rice would could in the ground beef drippings as well as the cheese inside would melt. Of course the cheese on top would also melt. I would recommend 90% - 95% beef versus the usual 80\/20. You do not want too much fat. But the juices continue to cook the pepper as well as the rice. When served have a side of pasta sauce. When you cut open the pepper the White Cheddar cheese mixed with the ground beef and rice would just run. The White cheddar has a different flavor and chemically creates a very different flavor than the orange cheddar. Growing up we had a tradition that my family was allowed to have their favorite dinner for their birthday and mine was always Dad's stuffed bell peppers.","My wife and I liked it a lot, only changes we made was we used ground turkey instead of beef (a lot healthier ), and we didn't mix in rice, we put fully cooked rice on plate like a bed and stuffed pepper on top. IT TURNED OUT GREAT, wife rated it a 8 out of 10. We had reason for the edits, we stopped eating ground beef years ago for health reasons, and used ground turkey ever since, which is a lot healthier and because we used turkey, that meant no grease, which rice would have absorbed and cooked in, so we put rice under it. THANK YOU for a great meal I could make for my wife I'm date night .. [picture is of last 2 out of 6 made, we are 2 a piece ha ha]","Very good! I used 3\/4 cup leftover white rice and a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes.","I didn't have worcestershire sauce so used a glob of barbeque sauce instead and they were delicious. I also added fresh tomatoes at end when I added the cheese and it topped them off well. I served with a few corn nacho chips.","Great recipe. Only changes I made was to use ground turkey like others suggested and added fresh garlic and garlic salt. I also used fresh tomatoes since I hate using canned veggies, and it's what I had on hand. Turned out amazing. Will definitely be make it more often","I had to add garlic to beef. I used turkey instead and no rice as im cutting back on carbs. Delicious....","I made this today and it turned out really well. I was a little surprised that one serving was 2 peppers. We thought that next time we would have 1-1\/2 peppers each and get 2 meals out of the dish. I would also leave out the cheese.","We use more beef, lots of worcestershire sauce, a can of fire roasted tomatoes, chop a jalapeno or two and have beef\/veg mix to bake around the peppers... we also top the peppers after cheese with chili sauce. Delic!","I made it with ground turkey and I only ate the filling but, it was still pretty good","Thanks for sharing the great recipe. I added Puerto Rican spices to it and my guys were blown away and want me to make it again. I left out Worcestershire sauce and added Adobo, Sazon, Sofrito, a little bit of fresh baby spinach and fresh minced garlic. Also used green and red bell peppers. Update: add spanish paprika for a nice spicy flavor","They are Great will show picture of my delicacy stuffed bell peppers.&quot;&quot;yum&quot;&quot;yum&quot;&quot;__yum&quot;&quot; I changed it up a little bit and put provalone inside of them. yum,,,and I put in the meat and rice v-8 juice and tomato 's and baked them and walla.","I will be using a can of rotel and some spaghetti sauce on these instead of the cheese, I will update on how they turn out!!!","Made these tonight and they were delicious. Made a few tweaks like others but it's a great base recipe. Just personalized it with some of my favorite spices. Will be making them again for sure as hubby loved them!!!","Made it for two, left peppers full, added more rice, still awesome!","They turned out great! I will definitely make these again. Tweaked; used ground turkey, salt-free tomato sauce, omited Worcestershire sauce, and used low-fat cheese. Next time, I will add more seasoning to the pepper instead of the dash of sea-salt, they were kind of bland if you wanted to just take a bite of pepper without the stuffing.","I like THIS recipe and directions. Simple and tasty altho I DID tweak a bit. I Didn't have canned tomatoes so I used Marinara sauce instead and a few dashes of red pepper flakes and I'm Spanish so A few dashes of Sazon and SOME s &amp; p. I ALSO DIDN'T have ANY more cheddar cheese so I used an Italian mixed cheese I had on hand. And I used precooked rice from yesterday's dinner. Omg---- CAN u say DELISH?!","I made that tonight, tweeked it a bit, I added chopped celery, and one half of a Jalapeno Pepper, chopped, and used Rotel for the diced tomatos. Delicious. Brack Paul South Alabama","This is as easy and delish as it gets. Per usual, always making tweaks. Instead of a tsp of the big &quot;W&quot; I added a tablespoon plus some (love the stuff), a whole pepper of choosing, added a good amount of garlic powder, and about a tablespoon of sugar and BAM! Flavor explosion","Love this recipe. I\u2019ve made it several times and everybody loves it.","Very good recipe, I had to add some celery and shredded sweet potatoes because I don't absorption problems. I will let you know how that goes.","We really ehjoyed the peppers. Put tomato sauce in the mix and drizzled it over the tops then added the cheese. Delicious!","We made this with half Italian sausage and half hamburger. Delicious addition! Thanks for posting!","Okay. It inspired me but I used 1\/2 lb ground chicken and 2 Johnsonville sausages and removed castings. Used tomato sauce (trader Joe\u2019s marinara) and 1\/2 cup of salsa. Added rice, mixed it up and added cheese at the end. I was very happy even if I didn\u2019t follow the recipe exactly.","Added a package of dried onion soup and a small can of tomato paste, best stuffed peppers ever!","Oo","I made my first batch, by boiling the peppers, as per recipe. The dish had a very fresh taste to it that i liked, I was in the mood to eat something nice and fresh and juicy. But then 2nd batch I made in my Webber Kettle, uncooked, I just brushed the peppers with a flavour infused olive oil, and dusted the inside of the pepper with Italian smoked paprika. And Wow what a different taste, nutty, spicy. I do like to dry fry my foods, meaning very little good quality olive oil, or coconut oil, even better. And here is the twist, use roasted chick pea and dollop of sour cream. Cilantro chopped up or yogurt, I have done breakfast the same way just filled with fresh organic eggs, shallots or spring onion with a bit of turmeric. Chirico sausage, bacon, when camping or barbequing, use normal beef or pork sausage.","I think this is a nice change for stuffed peppers. Good stuff!","I've made the stuffed green peppers now for several different occasions and people. They all have raved about how delish they were. I've added a few tweaks to the recipe. I use kosher salt,n I use the cook in the bag rice !! I also use a mix of cheddar&amp;mozz cheese!! Monja monja","These were delicious and easy to make. I added few dashes of garlic powder, a little bit of crushed red pepper and one Italian sausage link. They were really good. Pre-cooking the bell pepper is genius, all of the other recipes that I have tried, the meat was dry and sitting in water from the bell pepper. These did not have that all. Wonderful recipe!!","Split it in half and used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. My first time making stuffed peppers and they were good!","Delish. Always a favorite. Especially on a chilly night","I make this same recipe and have for years now . The only difference is after I drain the meat I add stewed tomatoes (chopped) then the rice and water 1 cup each cover and summer for 25 minutes or till water is absorbed and rice is cooked. Then instead of adding cheddar cheese I use Velveeta cheese. It melts right into the meat and rice mixture, I stir together stuff peppers and put into oven for 30 minutes. I got this recipe from my Betty Crocker cook book over 40 years ago and the only change I made was the Velveeta cheese and using stewed tomatoes (they have extra seasoning in them already) because that's what I had on hand","This was delicious! I wouldn't change a thing! Thank you for sharing!!","Family loved these. I added fire roasted tomatoes but next time I will also add some garlic and a can of rotel to spice it up a bit.","Great recipe! Even my picky eater enjoyed this, and we will definitely make it again. I followed the advice of some other other reviewers, so I made a few modifications: - Used a red\/yellow\/orange peppers - Used ground turkey - Added a couple of cloves of minced garlic when cooking the meat, onions, and peppers - Added water and rice to the mixture and simmered for 25 minutes until the rice was cooked - Filled peppers 1\/3 full with mixture, then shredded cheese and a spoonful of marinara, then filled the rest of the way with the mixture - Served with a side of marinara and some Parmesan cheese","I mixed ground beef and ground pork in mine. It was very good!","We loved this! I added a little cumin to my beef mixture and a slice of pepperjack cheese to top of pepper! Taste great!","Not bad. Followed to the letter. A bit bland and seemed to be heavy on the rice.","Very bland! I added more flavor and I'm so glad I did! Way more Worcestershire sauce, a little garlic salt, fresh diced mushrooms, fire roasted diced tomatoes (instead of regular ones), and I put some salsa and sour cream on it right before serving it! This is a great &quot;base&quot; recipe which I can also respect because it leaves room for the cook to add what they think will work. I would suggest not just cooking it by the book, get creative or it will be underwhelming.","This is an AWESOME recipe! So easy and surprisingly my son enjoyed it. I did not use rice to make it low carb and when I stuffed the pepper I would alternate between beef and cheese -- so it is like a pasta but inside of a green pepper. Also I bought spicy pasta sauce and used that instead as it gave it a bit of a kick without it being overly spicy. Also I do not boil the green peppers, but put them straight into the over at the tempterature stated and let it cook for longer. Doing it this way softens the pepper just enough without it becoming mushy (which frankly, is disgusting). Oh and you don't have to use green peppers, if you want some color try red, yellow or even orange. One more change, I don't use cheddar cheese but either a two or three cheese blend. I find cheddar doesn't melt very well and using a two or three cheese blend you get better taste.","This was my first time ever making stuffed bell peppers. This recipe was very easy to follow which is great because I'm a stay at home wife with 3 small children, and dinners can be a challenge at time. So thank you. I tweaked the recipe just a little. I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of the regular diced. And I also used sheredded velveeta mozzarella cheese instead of the cheddar cheese. Which made it nice and creamy. All in all this dinner was a hit in my home and will be made again in the future.","So delicious! I did make some slight tweaks. I added a jar of Herdez mild salsa casera and the canned tomatoes included garlic and olive oil. Instead of rice, I used quinoa.","I LEARN MY STUFFED GREEN BELL PEPPERS FROM MY DAD AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE COULD GET HIS PICKER EATERS TO EAT.","I also tweaked it but such minor changes. I added minced garlic to the beef\/onions\/peppers while they cooked. Also i added extra worcheshire sauce, maybe 4oz of tomato sauce, and about a tablespoon of Oregano. I did use green, yellow, and orange peppers to season. My mom couldn't wait so she (AND I) ate the filling while we waited lol. Great and simple recipe! Even the novice chefs can execute this flawlessly!","This is almost the exact same recipe I grew up eating. My dad always had my mom add bacon too.","I don't think I ever completly follow a recipe. The only changes I made was I added a bit more worcestershire sauce, a can of undrained stewed tomatoes and a tiny squirt of ketchup. It is cooking on the stove right now.","I chopped up bell pepper instead of stuffing and it was delicious that way too","Great traditional stuffed pepper recipe! I tweaked it and added garlic, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire and mushrooms. Next time I might cut the peppers in half because 1 pepper is a lot. Thanks for sharing!","This is a huge hit with my son (I made four...he ate all four...). But I didn't have any worcesteshire sauce, so I tried fish sauce...which apparently worked as well! I tarted it up with some bacon as suggested by another reader, and added in the chopped tops of the peppers to the meat.

This was a sweet, crisp topping that made for a nice caramelized taste when mixed in with the apples for serving.","My boyfriend is not a big fruit dessert friend, but he loved this.

I will add some cinnamon next time but will most definitely make this again soon.","great recipe, very easy, very fast!  i used two small granny smiths and a large ambrosia apple, and added cinnamon to my apples.  thanks for sharing!","It was really sweet with all the brown sugar maybe with the nuts it would help but didn't have the nuts to add.  Needs to be eaten with ice cream.","This was easy and my family and friends love the taste.  I am making it again for our office Holiday Party.  My family is hoping I will make enough for them too!  This was great! Thanks.","This was sooooooo Yummy!!! Thank you! I was looking for something feeling for a bed time snack.

I received HUGE compliments. I used 1\/2 vanilla chips and 1\/2 mini-choc chips, and cut the nuts to 1\/2 cup.","These bars are awesome!!!!! I didn't have any brown sugar, so I used granulated sugar and added 1 1\/2 tbsp of molasses to the mix. I also used 1 1\/2 cups dark chocolate chips, and butter instead of margarine, no nuts. DELICIOUS!!!! Soft and moist - even a couple days after baking. Great recipe.","VERY easy recipe!  Although regular chocolate chip cookies are easy enough, sometimes you just don't feel like waiting around for all the cookies to bake.  This is a great alternative, and you just mix it all in one bowl, no sifting the dry ingredients in another bowl.  Also, I liked that they're baked in a 9x13, as opposed to a jelly roll pan.  My family devoured them!  Would be great for bake sales too, when you need to bake something easy and in a hurry. I did use butter, and I lined the pan with heavy duty foil, then greased that, for easy clean up as well.  Thanks!","This was excellent!  Very quick and easy to make plus they are delicious!  I used a whole bag of chocolate chips and a half bag of butterscotch chips and it came out great!  Thanks for sharing!","These were really great. Like all the other reviewers, I found them delightfully simple to make, quick, and the result was absolutely DELICIOUS! Gooey, chocolate-y, and decadent! Everyone in my family loved these. Thanks for the recipe!","These were delicious.  We used toasted pecans and whole wheat flour.  These flew out of the pan!","MMMM good!  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside - perfect!  I had a few partial bags of chips that I decided to use up so I used about 1\/3 cup choc chips, 1\/3 white and 1\/3 butterscotch and the bars turned out fine.  So that these were school lunch friendly with our schools peanut free lunches, I also omitted nuts which didn't seem to deter the taste. Always good to make a recipe with ingredients always on hand!  Thx.","My husband thought these were good but I have to admit I was disappointed..not rich enough and I used butter.  Keep in mind I am a real chocolate lover.","Gosh these are good. What I love about them is that they taste like cookies that took a really long time, but they are so quick it's almost shameful. Perfect. YUM","These were pretty good, though not quite as good as tasty as I'd been hoping! I used butter so they were pretty rich and a little greasy, and I added in an extra half cup of chocolate chips. I'd hoped these would be thicker than they were, but perhaps I just didn't cook them long enough! 25 wasn't quite enough, so I put them in for two more minutes, but I wasn't sure how much they'd set up as they cooled, so I left them out after that and the middle sunk in a bit. Still a treat, though! Thanks!","Mmmmmm, these are delicious!  Easy to put together, they are quite tasty and when you don't have time to fuss, these are the ticket!","I love how easy these were to make.  I ate some and gave the rest to friends and coworkers.  Everyone loved them, but had no idea how easy they were to make!  Great, fun, easy recipe.  I will definitely be making these again.","Yum! I made mine just as the recipe said, but with butter instead of margarine, walnuts were my nut of choice, and I added 1\/2 cup raisins to it as well. They came out perfect.","A great choice when you need chocolate chip cookies in a hurry...especially with being able to use melted butter instead of softened. A little 'tougher' than a traditional cookie, but the kids didn't seem to mind. Thanks!","This cookie baked up nice and fluffy.  Looked and smelled wonderful.  My daughter loved the cookie dough. Very easy, to make.  I added a whole bag of chocolate chips.","yum yum yum! The kids had fun helping with mixing it all up....wonderful!","Exceptionally good bars! I used half shortening, half margarine. I also used 2 cups of dark chocolate chips.  Chewy and delicious!","Excellent! I used about 1\/2 cup less sugar and it tasted fine.","I just got done making these, and I'm really disappointed. They were more cake-like, and that's not what I was looking for. They weren't sweet enough for me either. I added a little bit more chocolate chips but I think they needed a lot more. I didn't care for them.","This recipe was wonderful!  I brought these to a family gathering and they were eaten up in minutes!  I added 1\/2 choc. chips and 1\/2 butterscotch, and it gave the bars a really great taste!  I also think you can use about 1\/2 the amount of butter.  But using the full amount does taste better.  I will definitely be using this one again!  Easy and delightful!","Everyone loved them! I chose to use half choc chips and half butterscotch chips and just 1\/2 Cup of peanuts as that is all I had on hand.   I did find them to be a bit too sweet so I will reduce the sugar by a 1\/4 Cup next time. I  like how quick and simple they are to prepare.  Thx for sharing this truebrit!","Excelent flavor, easy and quick to make. MMMM Good","These were the hit of the party! Thanks so much for the recipe.","These are really great.  Loved the ease of preparation. I had to make these twice in one day because I gave away the first batch and my son wanted more than just the one I gave him from the first batch. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine.  I was requested to make them without nuts so I bumped up the amount of chocolate chips to between 3\/4 to 1 cup.  I had a little trouble discerning when they were fully baked.  I was afraid of over cooking them. I had to put back the first batch to cook longer because the inside was still raw.  I baked mine in a 9 inch by 13 inch glass dish. I will make these again.","These bars were wonderful, and very easy to prepare.  I had to bake mine a bit longer, since they where not quite done in the center, but they turned out great, and tasted even better the next day, only thing is not many made it to the next day!  LOL  I used 2 cups chocolate chips, no nuts our preference.  A very nice bar recipe. Thanks.","I made mine with Valentine colored M & Ms and whole wheat flour.  I cut them into heart shapes with my son for his Valentine Day treat to share with his friends.  They turned out great!  Yum!","These did not work for me at all. Maybe because I used butter? They are greasy, flat, bland and have a weird rubbery texture. Not sure what happened to mine","I made these by directions, they seemed a bit greasy and maybe not so good day of baking.......BUT the next day. Wow they were great! My picky daughter loved them!

So - nothing to do but make it AGAIN!\r\nThis is an absolutely delicious recipe.  I used salsa in the enchiladas and enchilada sauce over the top, had green pepper instead of red, skipped bacon the first time and added rice the second time (because I was using leftovers from a weekend fiesta).

I also froze some extra filling by itself and that worked even better for us.  Thanks for a new family favorite.","These were a great hit!  Because picante sauce is just a term made up by Pace for their salsa, I used chunky salsa instead. These were great. I will make them again and again.

I used low fat cheese and wraps and they were excellent, even for those husbands that don't fancy the \"low fat junk\" he loved it!!  I used chilli powder instead of cumin and I ommited the bacon.  I also used (low fat) cheddar cheese because it was all I had at the time.  Can't wait till we have it again.... thanks so much!","This was a good recipe.  I like using the bacon grease to for the chicken, left it really moist.  I really don't think the bacon added anything to this dish.  I even used good thick bacon with a lot of flavor.  At the end of the day, I would leave out the bacon.  The rest of the flavors were great.  I would add a little more spice (heat) to the dish.  I would also saute the peppers with the chicken a little longer to soften them up or use roasted red peppers to really add a great flavor.  Overall a good dish and a great starting point for a lot of different options.","WOW, this will be going directly to the favoites book. It was even better reheated the second day. I think it would be great to triple and use for OAMC. I did not use the bacon greese to cook the chicken but thought that there was pleanty of bacon flavor.","This was a big hit this evening!

I've made it twice now and have added it to my cookbook.  Thanks!","This is a really good recipe.  I did make some changes for a few reasons. I used canned chicken breasts because I was trying to test to see if this would be easy enough to make while camping. I still cooked it in the pan with garlic it just didnt cook as long. I doubled the garlic.. we are garlic fans round here. I used green enchilada sauce in lieu od picante sauce.  I like it better.  I also mixed in a few tablespoons of sour creme in with the 1\/2 cup enchilada sauce to make it more like chicken sour cream enchiladas.  I also, based off another enchilada recipe I had my eye on spread the bottom of my baking sheet with a small layer of sour cream before placing the enchiladas in the pan.  Next time I make this I am omitting the red bell peppers... I ended up picking them out and my husbands wasnt a fan of them either... I will probably put in diced onion in with the chicken and garlic in lieu of red bell pepper.  We are also big fans of onion around here!  ;)","This is so good. We used the picante sauce and then also put a can of enchilada sauce on it too cause we like them saucy and it was a bit dry for us but other than that is was a awesome dinner!","This was a great recipe! I've made it a couple of times now and both times everyone really enjoyed them!","Hopping on the bandwagon... these are some tasty enchiladas!  I subbed regular onions for green and upped the garlic, but didn't add any cheese inside the enchiladas (I didn't have enough, and I figured it would be lower-calorie that way anyway.)  I like a creamy enchilada, so I worried these would be dry, but they tasted divine.  The little bit of bacon gave these a great flavor. Thanks!

Thanks for sharing Sean!","Tonight was my DH's turn to cook dinner.  I was going shopping and he asked me to buy some fish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whatever was on sale and looked good.   When I came home w\/ haddock he went right to the computer, logged on to my account on 'zaar and searched for haddock recipes.  (I'm so proud of him :-)).  This is the recipe he decided on and was it ever yummy!  There were only 3 of us eating tonight so I only purchased 1 fillet which was 1 \u00c2\u00bc pounds.  My DH adusted the recipe for 3 servings\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so perhaps we had more topping than the recipe intended but we thought it was a perfect amount.  He used a liberal shake of red pepper flakes in lieu of cayenne pepper.   The recipe did not mention anything about the skin.....my DH placed the haddock skin-side down in the baking dish, and hoped the fish would seperate from the skin like it does when grilling.  However the skin came along with the fillet so we just took our bites from the top, scraping them off the skin.  I think I'll ask the fish guy to remove the skin for me next time I buy haddock.   My 12 year old DS thought the fish was too spicy, not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspicy hot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but just too spicy.  We scraped the topping off but he still just picked\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.his loss!  DH served with basmati rice and a salad.

This wasn't a problem when making the crust, you just press them into the pan, but it did make it difficult to prepare the lattice top.

Be sure to bake them long enough, or the center will be sticky.  I've doubled the main recipe and used a 13\" X 9\" pan, and they are great!","I enjoyed making this recipe with my 11 yr. old son for his soccer team picnic.  We used a bag of frozen blueberries from the grocery store because fresh berries are so expensive.  The recipe (doubled) according to Kate Newell's recommendations turned out just fine and it was very easy for the two us.","I made these for my daughter's preschool and they were a hit! The children liked them, the teachers asked for the recipe and the parents were thrilled to see something healthy being served. ","These were soo good! I added some baking spice to the base and topping to give it an extra kick. I used margarine to make them vegan. These will be inhaled quite quickly. ","I really liked them, and have my second batch in the oven now cooking.  They are simple to put together and use simple ingrediants I usually have on hand. The kids love them, and they make a nice homemade healthy snack for their lunches.","Very yummy!  I made these for a picnic this weekend, but had to try one for \"quality control\" (and because they just looked so good!)\r\nI made these with frozen blueberries, and it's still very good.  I'm betting it would be even better with fresh berries.  I was skeptical about using the foil, but it made it so easy to get the bars out of the pan, and cut them without mangling them--and cleanup was so easy too.  I'll be using that trick more often- thanks!","Delicious!!!!  I would recommend using at least 2 cups of blueberries. My whole family enjoyed these. I will definately keep this recipe on hand.","Wow!  Really good way to enjoy fresh blueberries.  I was going to take them in to work, but I decided to keep them for myself  LOL.","These are really great and easy to make.  When I was simmering the blueberries I just cooked until the liquid became thick which was longer than 2 minutes. I will make these over and over again!!!","Wonderful!  These do not last very long. Making my second batch already since I've first made them only 2 days ago.  And I just bought a box of blueberries from Costco so I will be making at least 2 more batches!","These are delicious!  Following Kate Newell's suggestion, I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan.  However, the finished bars seem a bit \"floppy,\" for lack of a better word.  I was a bit sparse with the bottom layer, in fear that I wouldn't have enough left for the top, but next time I will pack the bottom more tightly and bake it for a few minutes longer to see if that helps firm up the base.","This recipe came out perfect for me. They were so good I am making another batch tonight..","Great recipe. My family thought these tasted like bars from a professional bakery. I increased the bluberries to 2 cups, and because the recipe doesn't specify which kind of oats to use, I made two different batches (quick oats v. rolled oats).  The quick oats won--they held their shape much better.","These bars are a great fresh tasting treat they are not too sweet. I used 2 cups of blueberries as per another review. I also tried two batches one with old fashioned oats rough chopped and one with them left whole, I prefered the chopped ones.","I made these and took them to a 4th of July party, they were a big hit.  Very easy to make.  I had a ton of blueberries to use, so this was perfect.  I doubled the recipe and made them in a 9x13 pan.  Yum","I made these as a special treat for my boyfriend -- now fiance -- when he was having a particularly rough day and needed a pick-me-up. Any blueberry goodie wouldhave made him happy -- it's his fave fruit -- but this absolutely delighted him! I used a bag of organic wild blueberries, which I thought would add even more to the recipe... and I must have been right, because what little he didn't immediately finish off became his breakfast the next day. :)","Recipe didn't specify, so I used O.F. oats - I think quick would have worked better.  I also found it to be too sweet for my liking, but I will try again with quick oats and less sugar.","These tasted great but next time I would double the recipe.I used a 9 \" pan and they were way too thin.Even if I had used a 8\" pan they wouldn't be thick enough.The blueberry layer needed to be much thicker for my liking.I used fresh frozen local Newfoundland berries and the taste really came through.","These were fantastic!  The recipe is really easy, and I'll definately make it again.\n\n**Updated** ~ Made these again, using 1 cup frozen blueberries and 1\/2 cup frozen raspberries - delish!!!\n\nThanks AGAIN!","Excellent! Accidentally baked them in a rectangular pan so they came out thinner than they should have but were delicious anyway. Tasted like a blueberry oat cookie....\ncrunchy but kind of chewy as well....I'll definitely be making these again!!! Thanks!","Hello BB!\n\nThis is terrific! I am up alot at night so keeping up with Zaar is one of the things I do.  Came across this recipe last night and had to make it immediately as I had all the ingredients on hand.  Used SMart Balance for margarine and WheyLow brown sugar--otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Well, I guess not.  I put it in a ceramic rectangular pan sprayed with PAM rather than using  foil. Had to have a piece right away.  Came out of the pan with ease and tasted AWESOME.  The cookie part was probably the best oatmeal cookie I've had in ages.  Can already think of a number of variations. Apple raisin \/cinnamon; cherry almond; pumpkin spice.  Anyway thank you for a great midnight snack.\nJudy in Wa","During the summer I just eat fresh blueberries, but I got a bum pint of mushy berries, which prompted me to make these bars.  They were wonderful!  My husband, who doesn't like blueberries, had 3.  I did add some cinnamon to the base and topping, because I can't help myself.  I will definitely make these again (won't wait for a mushy carton of berries next time!)","i got the craving for blueberry bars when a friend made some that were oh-so-yummy.  i didn't have enough blueberries on had to make her recipe so i opted for this one.  so glad i did as the oatmeal was SUCH a nice partner for the blueberries.  i added some sliced almonds to the top before baking.","My whole family loves anything with blueberries and since they are in season and fresh, I decided it was time to make a few new desserts, this being one of them!  It was absolutely delicious with a dollop of Cool Whip over the top!","I was looking for something that hubby could carry with him in his lunch and I believe I found it!  I LOVE these!  I am adding this to my Tried and True cookbook of recipes that I love!","Simply and great recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 pan.  I cooked the crust for 15 minutes and it ended up with a little crunch.  This is a great recipe to take to a picnic or work party where fridge space is tight.  yum yum!","I added some extra bluberries, and i added a touch of cinnamin to the crust. Wonderful! My boyfriend loved them!  Will be making again. I think that this would also be great with other typed of berries.","These are really, really good. I also increased the blueberries to 2 cups and probably could have gone to three without increasing the topping or crust. Hint: do NOT use steel-cut oats, quick cooking or otherwise. They make the crust way too hard for most people.","I made these according to directions but I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust mixture...YUM! Very nice recipe. Came out lovely and everyone enjoyed these tremendously.","So simple and so good. I made this for our picnic the night before. I doubled the recipe and just used the whole bag of frozen berries & made sure i packed down the bottom crust and added cinnamon to the top crumb mix. I will forever keep this recipe! Ty BB","Used fresh raspberries from my garden.  Really tasty bars.  Will make again.  Added cinnamon and nutmeg in the filling.","Amazingly yummy!  I pulsed the rolled oats in the food processor for a few seconds.  The results had some whole oats, chopped oats and coarse oat flour.  It worked beautifully.  I made a double batch twice today in a 13x9 pan.  There was not enough blueberries to cover but was somehow they cooked into a nice layer.  The second I upped to 2 cups and there were berries in a nice single layer across the whole pan.  Both were great so don't fret if you only have enough to make as written.  I used parchment paper to line the pan folded it up the sides.  Nothing is more foolproof that parchment.  Loved the recipe!","YUMM! These were so fantastic, so easy to make and so delicious.  I think my boyfriend ate about 5 in a row!  I can't wait to experiment with different berries, and maybe some chocolate.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!","Made these for Easter and the whole extended family loved them. I used half blueberries and half cherries. Next time, I'll increase the fruit just a little, and add a touch of ginger or cinnamon. Just a little something extra.","Excellent bars and soooo easy!  Great for the kids lunchbox, a morning treat with coffee, or a yummy dessert served warm and topped with vanilla ice cream.  I didn't have enough blueberries, so I added some chopped strawberries...FANTASTIC!","Blueberry Picnic Bars to the rescue!  I had an abundance of blueberries and was looking for a recipe, other than muffins, to make with them.  I used a slightly larger pan which resulted in my bars being a little thin...a mistake I will not make the next go'round.  Delicious treat, well deserving of many occasions other than just picnics!","I added about 1\/2 t. cinnamon to the topping crumb mixture.  Baked as directed in an 8\" square pan.","I was so excited to make these, and i followed the recipe EXACTLY. they were not very good, and not sweet at all. bummer","Delish! I used blueberry pie filling- came out fantasitc for 4th of July picnic! Thanks for sharing~","Delish!","Outstanding!  I have to stay out of the kitchen so that I do not eat the entire pan.  My only caveat is that they are still quite gooey.  It's over 85 F in our house (A\/C is out) and while the cooled, I think they would have set better had I refrigerated them.  I will double the recipe next time.","These are great! Here are my substitutions: subbed regular flour for gluten-free flour and threw in a pinch of xanthan gum (I'm gluten intolerant). Used a loose 1\/2c brown sugar instead of packed. Used 1\/4tsp stevia in place of the sugar for the berries. Next time I'll use a few more berries, but DH loved them and he is usually hard to please if it's not chocolate :)","I admit I could not leave well enough alone, I added a bit of cinnamon to the base and some almond flavoring to the butter before mixing.  I also did not read ahead and instead of cooking the berry mixture I just spread it over the base and covered with remaining crumb mixture.  It was too late when I realized it so I just baked anyway and it turned out great, not gooey and plenty of plump berries in every bite without doubling.","Nothing spectacular, but very good!","Awesome. Made for a family reunion. Doubled recipe for a 9x13 pan and used 4 cups of blueberries.","Wow, these are really tasty and pretty healthy.  I used whole wheat flour and sprinkled about 1 tablespoon of Grapenuts cereal on the topping for extra crunchiness, otherwise, followed recipe to a T.  Next time I will do what other reviewers said and increase blueberries to 2 cups so I could get full blueberry coverage.  My family really like the base, they said it tastes like a cookie.  Nice recipe, I will make these again.  Thank you.","Made these bars twice in a week!  Once as 8x8 and the next time doubled recipe using 13&quot;x9&quot; jelly roll pan.  Made two changes increased the blueberries by 1\/2 cup and used Earth Balance Organic Butter (dairy allergy). These are simply wonderful ~ thank you Barefoot Beachcomer!","I've made these at least a dozen times! We're a gluten and dairy free family, and these are so easy to adapt to fit our needs. I use GF oats, Krusteaz GF all purpose flour, and Earth Balance margarine. I've also ground some oats into flour and used that before too, but they end up a little more crumbly. I've made these with blueberries, mixed berries, canned cherry pie filling, and homemade apple pie filling. They're a hit at every potluck and ladies night I've taken them to!

I like a thicker bar so I did ingridents x4 on this.  I don't have alot of patience to measure for baking so I eyeballed it. I used the juice and zest of one orange,2 eggs, 1 1\/2 cups sugar, 1 stick of butter, flour x 3, bp x 4 and a whole bag of coconut. The result was delicous. DH and DS enjoyed as well as me. Going into my favorite zaar recipes. Sorry for the long  review but I wanted you to know how good it was multiplying the recipe. Thanks :) Made for ZWT 5.","Very tasty but next time I will either double the recipe and use an 8 inch pan or use a 4 inch pan because the squares were too thin, great flavor though.","Yummy orange and coconut taste for DD, DH and I. However I found them hard on the sides of the pan and that is why I took off a star. I'm not sure why this happened, it may be because of my substitutions or like another reviewer stated they were too thin. I used canola oil instead of butter as we are dairy free, white sugar for the sugar, egg replacer and orange juice for the liquid in the egg as well as to replace the milk like a couple other reviewers did as well. I used desiccated (smaller than shredded) coconut but believe flaked would be better in this. I used Recipe #256259 for the flour and gluten free baking powder and sea salt for the salt. I forgot to grease my glass baking dish so it stuck like crazy but even though it broke into millions of pieces because of that, it was very tasty and I would make this again though next time I would like to try with flaked coconut and raw cane sugar. Photo posted. Made for ZWT5 for Cooks With Dirty Faces.","This is a wonderful chewy cake like bar...love the coconut and orange together. I used sweetened flaked coconut because that is what I had o hand but I forgot to cut the sugar back. I think that made the recipe a tad too sweet. When making again (and yes, I will make this again) I will cut the sugar back quite a bit if the coconut is sweetened. Thanks Dreamgoddess for such a tasty recipe. Made for the 29th AUS\/NZ Recipe Swap.","No need to alter the recipe.  These squares taste truly wonderful but just a bit on the dry side.  To get it a little moister, simply cover the pan with foil as soon as it comes out of the oven while cooling.  Another tip...if you are using sweetened coconut flakes, cut the sugar back in half.  <br\/><br\/>Great recipe.  Thank you!","Very good coconutty dessert!

I wasn't sure about the potatoes being cooked well (I seem to have problems) so I put them in the microvave for a minute or so to soften them up a bit.

I was sick of peeling apples, but I didn't want to waste them.  I followed your recipe, but I cooked them on LOW in my crockpot overnight.  I washed, quartered, and cored them, and filled the crockpot, skins and all.  The next morning, I pureed it in the blender,poured into sterilized jars, and processed in a water bath.  This was the easiest applesauce recipe I've ever found.  It does have a nice pink color when it's done, too.   ","Delicious applesauce-- made mine with Jonagold, Empire, and Cortland apples that we picked at an orchard last weekend.  Love the fact that the peels can be incorporated-- more nutrients and less hassle.  I took papergoddess' lead and cooked this in the crockpot overnight.  I added 1 T lemon juice and instead of sugar, went with 3\/4 c Splenda (we like it sweet).  I didn't add any water at all, and I'm glad I didn't because there was enough lodged in the apples themselves to produce a great sauce consistency.  It was lovely this morning with sour cream over whole wheat pancakes.  (P.S. If you don't own an apple corer, by all means get one!  It makes quick work of coring and rough chopping.)","This is a really great applesauce. I loved it and I really think the vanilla added alot of flavor to it.

I did it in the corckpot and then I did another batch on the stove. the crockpot version turned out better, but I don't know why.  next time, I'll definitely take the time to peel the apples--I just used my handblender to puree everything, and it left sharp slivers of peel.

Great Recipe","I made this last night and it was very good.  I've been using the same Kung Pao recipe for years and this was a nice change.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. I marinated the chicken as directed but I changed the veggies.  Same amount but I added zucchini and left out the celery.  I used a little less green pepper and a little more onion.  I didn't have any hot peppers on hand so I left them out and made up for the volume with the zucchini.  Today I found some fresh water chestnuts at the store and bought those.  You have to peel them and they aren't nearly as cheap as the ones in a can but they are so much better.  They are sweet and juicy and to me they taste almost exactly like jicama.  Sort of a cross between a potato and an apple.  I'll use these some time this weekend for another Chinese dish.\r\n\r\nThe veggies aren't really what a Kung Pao recipe is about anyway.  It's about the sauce and the chiles.  This is what attracted me to this recipe out of the many that are on this website.  I doubled the amount.  Otherwise I made it pretty much to spec but when I tasted it before adding to the dish it was way too strong for my tastes.  I'm quite used to flavor-packed Asian dishes, especially Thai and Indian curries.  But I've ordered this dish in restaurants many times and I thought the sauce was just too intense.  So I thinned it a bit with some chicken stock and then added corn starch to help it thicken.  I probably added 2\/3 cup, give or take.  It was still full of flavor and tasted about right.  I also added some Thai chile garlic sauce to the sauce mix for more heat and chile flavor.  This recipe usually has dried red chiles, (whole) added to the hot oil before adding the chicken and you cook until the chiles just start to brown.  Leave them in for a dramatic effect but warn your guests that they aren't really good to eat.  I suppose you can eat them but they're really just dry and nearly burned.  \r\n\r\n I used crushed red peppers,(out of whole dried peppers too) several cloves of garlic and 1 or 2 tablespoons of minced ginger to the oil before cooking the chicken. Adding ginger and garlic to the hot oil is pretty common with Chinese stir fried dishes and really adds great flavor to the meat.  \r\n\r\nAs I said, Kung Pao is mostly about the sauce and the chiles.  I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I really think it needs to be diluted a bit to make it more authentic.  Chicken stock is perfect for this but you'll want to add a little corn starch, maybe a couple of tablespoons, so that it will thicken when you cook it.  Good stuff and I'll be making it again for sure.  Thanks for posting the recipe.\r\n\r\nBruce","This one is the BEST! The leftovers were also great the next day.

The recipe doesn't say if the butter is to be melted or softened, but I tried it melted and it worked. The only changes I would make is to reduce the sugar (personal preference) and use castor sugare instead of normal, as my brownies were a little grainy, with crystals of whole sugar through it.","Don't know how I missed reviewing this! I made these up as xmas gifts a few years ago, and kept a batch for myself. After eating my batch I wished that I had kept all of the other jars for myself - they're THAT good!

Even my DH, who said he doesn't like squash, was gobbling it up and suggesting we make it for Thanksgiving.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I made it like the directions said, only I halved the squash, scraped it out of the shells when baked, and mashed them all together to mix the flavors evenly.  Mmmm.","Tasty","This is very tasty. I cut my squash in half, and baked it for an hour at 400F and it came out perfectly. I also brushed some of the syrup\/butter mix from the hollows over the sides of the squash near the end - gave it a nice browned appearance.","What a treat!","Delicious! Mine took an hour to cook...but this reminded me so much of the recipe my Mom use to make...not sure if she used the syrup or brown sugar...thanks for the memory...=) made for &quot;What&#039;s on the Menu&quot; tag game...","I made this for dinner last night in an effort to get DH to enjoy baked squash. He is not a fan of winter squash.  I cut the squash in half instead of thirds and used I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s not butter light.  I goofed and put 1 tablespoon of maple syrup in each half but it was delicious and perfect that way.  I chose not to add the cinnamon and nutmeg since I mostly wanted the flavor of the squash.  My husband likes a sweet taste but I prefer just butter, salt and pepper on my squash.  This was a simple, tasty solution to please us both since the maple syrup gives a lovely flavor with the butter without all the sweetness of brown sugar.  We both ate an entire half, I call this success!  It took much longer than  45 minutes to bake and I also put a small amount of water in the bottom of the baking dish and did not cut a piece off the bottom, they sat at only a slight angle and were fine.  I took a fork at the end to each half and blended the squash and pool or butter and maple syrup together for the perfect marriage in every bite!  I also added a touch of salt to my half.

What a delicious dessert -- and especially nice served warm with cream or vanilla ice cream. There is absolutely no need to add the extra sugar suggested by some other reviewers, unless you have an extreme sweet tooth. Made and thoroughly enjoyed for the bake-a-thon in memory of CoolMonday.","mmm thank you~!\nits the first time ive made anything with rhubarb, but it turned out lovely.  i made it in a lined pound cake tin; with half amounts, and also added honey where there was sugar.  baked for 40mins and it came out perfectly done.","very yummy.  I thoghut it was just sweet enough and my daugher, with the healthy sweet tooth nearly finished the dish.  I don't like sickly sweet stuff.","Delicious!

The cornstarch filling \"makes\" this. Thanks so much Ed, for posting.\nRoxygirl","I love this recipe.  The crust is delicious and the tartness of the rhubarb is balanced nicely by the sugar in the filling and crust.  I've made this several times and everyone I serve it to loves it as well!

I would have liked a bit more rhubarb in it, so next time I may use 5 cups instead of 4. We ate it with vanilla  ice cream, and it was just wonderful! Thank you, I will make this again!","interesting recipe - I had company and was chatting whilst I prepared this, unfortunatley I wasn't concentrating,so I ended up with all the sugar in the crunch and not in the rhubarb!  As a result the crunch was too sweet and the rhubarb was sour.  I will be more careful next time!  I aslo didn't cook it quite long enough - so the rhubarb was a little crunchy!!!  Cooks errors!","I love this! I did however find the sugar content way over the top so I substituted the sugar in the 'crunch' part with 1\/4 cup sugar and again took it down to 1\/4 cup sugar in the cornstarch mixture and added one apple to the rhubarb to add natural sweetness, it was perfect! A definite winter warmer!","Excellent!  Thank you for sharing!  LA :-)","Yum, yum yum!  What a great way to use up some rhubarb I had hanging around in my freezer.  I thought it was just sweet enough, especially since I was serving it with sweetened whipped cream and ice cream!  This was great Ed!","I had a sweet tooth, and a bunch of frozen rhubarb, so I did a search and found this recipe.  Turns out I was out of vanilla, so I subbed 1\/2 t. of almond extract since I was afraid it might overpower.  I was right.  Even the reduced quantity is one of the major flavors.  I'm sure it would be better with vanilla, or is there such a thing as strawberry extract?","Mmmmmm mmmmmm!!!!!","Super duper!!!  I will make this again!  The guys at work mowed this down!  I will have to make a double batch next time!  Yummy!","This recipe was very easy and very good.  I would suggest doubling it as a 9\"x9\"\" pan was just not big enough for our family of four!! We served it with ice cream hot out of the oven and it was great...not too sweet but also not sour..just right.  We made it exactly as written and will make it again for sure!!  Thanks for posting, Ed Paulhus!!","This is almost the same as my grandma's recipe except the sugar was doubled to 1 cup.  YUM!  The best!  I usually prefer it with Cool Whip.","This is soooo good!! I'm making it again today!!! I have added a tsp of cinnamon to the crumb mixture.","Absolutely delicious!  I made a double batch, following directions as listed except I doubled the white sugar.  This was the best crunch topping I've ever had, so we will use the basic recipe with other fruits also!  Thanks!","I made this dessert last night with a 8x8 glass, pam sprayed ,casserole dish.Othertwise I followed the recipe..Was plenty sweet enough without the added sugar .This was so good my DH and I ate half of it ourselves..I would highly recommend making this to anyone who likes rhubarb ..I will make this again.Thank U for this recipe..","This is the 2nd time I have made this recipe.  First time made it according to directions...it was good!!  2nd time...got creative...doubled the recipe using 4 cups rhubarb and 4 cups blackberries.  Good...maybe great :)   I love this recipe....It's easy,  it's adaptable and dog gone good to eat!  Thank you for posting!","Delicious!  Baked in ungreased glass pan with no sticking.  Will prebake \"crust\" next time to see if I can get more crunch.  Will add 1\/2 cup more rhubarb next time for higher fruit to crunch ratio.  Crumb mix is soooooo good - though should be able to cut brown sugar by 1\/8 cup without sacrificing taste.  Can't wait to try it with other fillings.  Used 1 tsp honey in place of 1\/2 cup sugar in syrup, since a recent review stated it \"Was plenty sweet enough without the added sugar.\"  My new garden's rhubarb apparently needs some sweetening, sadly.  Topped with 1\/2 cup chopped almonds, sweetened flake cereal, and granola for last 10 minutes of baking to toast, adding more crunch and nutrition.  Will add nuts to bottom layer as well next time.  Overall a delightful treat.  Heading back to the kitchen for some more nibbling, and I'm not even a nibbler.","\"Delicious!\", to quote another reviewer.  This was not as sweet as I was expecting based  on other reviews, but the fault may be in my rhubarb.  For me though, this was a good thing.  I often forgo any sort of sweet topping on similar desserts because the sweetness is too much for me.  This particular crumble's tartness is a great pairing for ice, whip & sweetened creams, much to my delight!  Another reviewer also mentioned the fruit to crumble ratio and I concur - next time I will add more fruit.  This was my first foray into the world of rhubarb and it was a success.  Thanks for a terrific recipe Peggy!","Best rhubarb recipe yet ! I have 5 rhubarb plants and so far my favorite way to use it is in strawberry rhubarb pie. But after trying this recipe I think there will be less pies in the freezer. I don't think this will be something to mske ahead & freeze but I think using frozen rhubarb in this wouldn't matter. I did use about 6 cups of rhubarb just because I like lots of fruit in my pies\/cobblers. Great recipe.","Great with ice cream!","I made this for a 9 X 13 pan by multiplying the ingredients by 1.5.  This is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.","I'm so glad I found this recipe still here!  Made this a few summers back and was thrilled. I'm more used to having strawberries with my rhubarb so I did a 50\/50 and the results were delish! (and a pretty color naturally)  and plenty sweet....no need for more sugar at all- felt guilty enough for having something so sugary sweet as it was! The crunch was just right, wonderful recipe!!","I agree with out reviewers about pre-baking the crust. Mine was both too thick and too mushy. Overall too delicious to care about the texture but it would have been fabulous had the crust been more solid and less mushy. Thank you for sharing, will definitely make this again. Serve with ice cream. :)","YUM!!! This is definitely a keeper!!","This is a wonderful springtime treat! I took the advice of a few others and pre-baked the crust 12 minutes to help it set up. I added about 6 strawberries to the fruit mix for added color and flavor. I baked it all for an additional 50 minutes. I'm not a big rhubarb fan, but I LOVE this!","Simple, delicious recipe made on request from friends.  I added a bit more cinnamon to counteract the sugar and cooked it for an additional 15 minutes.  (Cinnamon is really good if you have a somewhat high glucose level.) The crumb topping is wonderful with vanilla bean ice cream on top.  My guests were delighted as was my hubby and I.  Thanks for a really good crunch Ed, which I'll be making again!","Would give it more stars if I could!!  We loved this rhubarb dessert, recipe was easy to follow with simple ingredients that I always have on hand. Used some splenda in place of sugar and it set-up just perfectly. Sooo gooood!!","Wow! This is fabulous.  Like other reviewers, however, I cut the sugar in half to 1\/4th cup and it still was plenty sweet.  Great recipe, Ed!","easy and good. served with whipped cream or\/and vanilla icecream in july 10 for DH and BF. Thanks for sharing!","This is my family's favorite rhubarb recipe.  My aunt always added one can of cherry pie filling to the rhubarb mixture and my family prefers it that way.","This is delicious. I used half the recipe to do the crunch but used only 1\/4 cup brown sugar. I also used only 1 cup rhubarb since that was all I had. Make a good serving for the two of us. The recipe has the right balance between sweetness and tartness. Will definitely make again thanks for posting.","Excellent!   Followed DuChick recommendations.","Simple to make....delicious to  eat!! I added 1\/4 tsp nutmeg to the crust.  Will make again.","Really good! Used about 1\/2 cup more rhubarb cause that's what I had. Everyone enjoyed it with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","I am rating this recipe based on rave reviews by my friend, Barb. She sent me her recipe and I was going to post it here but this one is so similar, that it will save me the time! Her recipe calls for 1\/2 cup oatmeal, butter instead of margarine, and more white sugar. I like the idea of less sugar though. She also suggests that strawberries and peaches are good to mix in or substitute.","Really nice flavour &amp; fairly easy to make!  I just found the crust &amp; topping to be more chewy than crunchy.","This was good, my bottom crust got really hard, dont know what i did.  I did prebake it according to another post.

Thanks Bohod","I have been searching for the perfect rhubarb pie recipe for several years and this is IT!  We love rhubarb without strawberries and a bit on the tart side.  This recipe is a keeper - I'm delighted to say that my search is over!","This was so easy to make and was the best tasting Pie ever just love the orange flavor.  Its a keeper","I did not care for the citrus flavor..","This is a fantastic recipe!  I think that it's a little more \"citrusy\" than a typical rhubarb pie, but still ... it has a great taste.  I served this to my family and they said I should make this commcercially.  I think it's a winner!","I followed the measurements very carefully and the pie turned out  sloppy.  Maybe skipping the orange juice would do it.","A very good recipe but like cookinthewoods, ours did not set up either.  So the second one we made we used a total of 4 1\/2 tablespoons of corn starch.  Perfect, it set up nicely.  We also egg washed the lattice top and sprinkled it with turbinado sugar.  I love this sugar as it adds a nice crunch to your baked goods.  Thank you for posting as we will be using your recipe again.  Made for *Zaar Cookbook Tag 2009* game","This pie did not set well for me.  I added 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, but it was not enough.  Next time I make it I'll try Charlotte J's suggestion of 4 1\/2.","Really great rhubarb pie, kinda tart but not a killer.  I used 4 Tbs cornstarch and it worked well, next time maybe a little less for a juicier pie.  Thanks for posting.","Was very good. I used a Tablespoon more corn starch than the recipe specified and it set up perfectly.","This recipe was fabulous!  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and increased the cornstarch to 4-1\/2 Tbsp and it set up perfectly!!  I actually made two pies--one, strawberry-rhubarb (added about 1-1\/2 cups fresh sliced strawberries to basic recipe and decreased rhubarb by about 1 cup) and I made a rhubarb pie for the purists in my family...High praise for both and this recipe is definitely going in my keeper file.  Thank you!","Great pie.  Made it with just 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet for me.  I was afraid it would be too runny after pouring the mixture into the crust, but it set up nicely after cooling.

Ty for a tasty little treat!","These were amazingly good peanut butter cups, as good as if not better than the real thing.  \n\nI noticed a lot of people complained about them being too sweet.  So after comparing similar recipes, I decided to cut down the sugar to a little less than 1.25 cups which gave it the perfect sweetness.  I used Skippy natural peanut butter and a little more than a cup of Hershey's milk chocolate chips.\n\nThe only problem I had was the peanut butter filling got stuck to the bottom of the pan making it difficult to scoop out the bars without mangling them.  Next time, I will use cupcake wrappers to eliminate this problem and make them more like actual peanut butter cups.","My 11 yr old daughter makes a version VERY similar but simpler in instructions (mostly by pkg - not measured). Hers reads: 2 pgs Gram Crackers, 1 box Pwd Sugar, 2 cubes melted Butter, 1.5 cups PB & 2 bags Milk-Choc Chips. (13x9\" pan) \r\nShe said she never tried adding vanilla but will next time.\r\nThis is definately a family favorite!","I made them like real peanut butter cups.  I put 8 mini choc chips in bottom of mini muffin tins. Melted them and spread on bottom.  Chilled to set.  Mixed filling and put evenly into cups.  Chilled again.  Put melted choc ontop and chilled again.  Took to work and they were a huge hit. These will be on my xmas candy list for sure!!","This is my standby favorite for parties & Christmas gifts & exchanges, because it's so fast and easy! I have made these lovely darlings several times for groups large and small. They are usually the first to disappear, and fans invariably ask for the recipe. It's the texture produced by the graham cracker crumbs that really gives the mouth-feel of a Reese's Cup. Of course, the flavor is fabulous! They are extremely rich, so are best cut in small pieces. The chocolate topping does tend to crack if it is chilled too long (I've made the mistake of chilling overnight before cutting) so Tonkcats' 2 hour chill time is a good guideline to follow. Excellent contribution Tonkcats - thanks!!","Outstanding...","Made these for my fiance's law firm - they loved them.  Have been asked several times for the recipe.  Was impressed by how fast and easy they are to make.","I make this same recipe, but instead of making bars, I roll the mixture into balls.  IT takes a little more time, but looks very impressive.","My 15 y\/o DD had been bugging me to make these - we had made a similar recipe years ago that we found in a kids cook book.  We made them last week when she had some friends over and everyone loved them.  She just finished the last piece yesterday, so she and I made another batch today.  This time I added 1 full cup of PB and melted about 1 1\/2 cupds chocolate chips in about a 1\/4 cup of heavy cream.  Haven't tried the finished product yet, but I thought the last batch needed a little more PB and she thought they needed more chocolate. We'll see how these taste!","This was a nice recipe using things I had on hand. With Easter just around the corner, I made mine into egg shapes instead of bars. I made some slight variation as follows: First I made the peanut butter mixture, formed into eggs and froze till firm- then I quickly coated with chocolate. For the chocolate, I used 1 1\/4 cup chips + 2 teaspoons of Crisco in order to form a smooth, glossy coating for my eggs. I then let the coated eggs cool overnight. Note, about 10 graham cracker squares (or about 5 whole crackers) equal 1 cup of crumbs. This one is worthy of an Easter Basket- Very rich, but oh so yummy!","These are a great recipe.  I cut the sugar down to 1 1\/2 cups.  These are really close to the real thing.  My husband loves them.","These were pretty good!  I only used 2\/3 c powdered sugar and 1 c of p.b. as someone else suggested and WOW...they were sweet.  Can't imagine what they'd have been like had I used all the sugar it called for! Definitely a treat for the sweet tooth!","My kids really liked these, and they sort of do resemble Reeses.  Less sugar taste and maybe a few finely minced peanuts would make it better.\nI made a 2 serving batch which has been plenty since it's so rich that smaller servings are just fine.","OH YUM!  These were wicked good.  My long time favs...chocolate in my peanut butter\/ peanut butter in my chocolate :)  I used chunky honey nut peanut butter, cinnamon flavored grahams and just under 1.5 cups of sugar.  After chilling, I cut them into about a dozen small squares.  I am keeping them in the fridge but they are disappearing fast.  A yummy candy recipe - I think better then the real thing! :)  Thanks Toncats!","Yes, these are super good.  Make them once, and you will crave them forever...","These taste just like the real thing!!  Yum!","Yummy! I used this peanut butter filling to make peanut butter cups. I changed the recipe a bit according to what I read in ratings-- I upped the peanut butter to 1 cup, and only added a cup of sugar, especially since the peanut butter I was using was organic unsalted. The graham cracker crumbs were an unexpected nice touch; they gave the mixture a really nice texture. Thanks for a great recipe!","By the time I finished with it I thought it was at least four stars, but I had a great deal of trouble with the bottom part.  The first time I made it, the bottom was a big crumbly mess.  I had to pry the chocolate off, melt more butter and add it to the bottom mixture, remixed it up and re-pressed it back into the dish, I scraped the dry bits off the back of the chocolate I pried off, remelted it and re-spread it. After all that, they were really good, and went like wild fire at the office.","This is a very easy recipe and even though it isn't EXACTLY like a Reese's, it's as close as I've found. Thanks for a really DEE..LISH recipe.","Very good!  \r\n\r\nI did mine a little different. I melted the chocolate chips and spread on the bottom and sides of a pie tin...(freeze) then spread on the peanut buttery goodness and then melted another round of chocolate chips and spread.  A giant peanut butter cup!\r\n\r\nAlso, next time i'll definitely use dipping chocolate instead of chocolate chips.","Excellent! I took smltheppl's advice and decreased the amount of powdered sugar... I used 1 1\/3 cups and the result was fabulous! I also would recommend unsalted butter. Way to go Tonkcats!!!","This was a great recipe for making PB  cups!  I did adjust the recipe a little, as I wanted something a bit more pure in peanut butter taste. I used 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 cup creamy PB and cut the butter down to 1\/4 cup. For the chocolate I used a blend of Ghiradelli candy coating and Callebaut milk chocolate.\n\nTo make PB cups-\n1)) spoon a line of PB mix onto sheets of wax paper and roll into a skinny uniform log, about 3\/4 inches in diameter and freeze.  \n2)) Meanwhile line a mini muffin tin with  #4 or #5 size brown candy cups. Pipe or spoon just enough chocolate to cover the bottoms, then shake the pan  a little to smooth out evenly.  \n3)) Chill chocolate pan for 10 minutes in the fridge or until hard.\n4)) Cut 1\/2 inch slices from PB log, place on top of hardened chocolate in candy cups, then fill the rest of candy cup with melted chocolate.  Shake pan a little to even out chocolate and chill.","Satisfies the sweet tooth, you only need a few bites unlike some desserts where you just keep wanting more. Will reduce amount of powdered sugar and chocolate and increase pb next time for a more pb taste (my own personal preference) and to help combat the slight crumbliness. Put leftovers in freezer for a cold treat later!","i love the taste, my DH and his friend are Reeses lovers and I brought a ball of the filling out to them and there eyes light up and they freaked out. They said it tasted just like PB cups!\n\nAnd after I dipped them in chocolate, I was told that I had out done Hershey!","This was very yummy! I used the recipe to get rid of some extra graham cracker crumbs and had to get creative with the chocolate topping (candy bars, etc.) since we had no chocolate chips! It was great and everybody loved it!","I make these all the time. I have found that it's best to use JIF peanut butter instead of the natural kind because it's stiffer\/thicker. It's also better to use chocolate graham crackers. I find that using those two are important in making it tastes much like Reeses but also the texture holds up better. If anyone is having issues with their chocolate being too 'chocolately' simply melt a TB of peanut butter with it. Also, its fun to get creative with these. I've tried them in various shapes and sizes. One of my favorite, super easy treats!","I made these for dessert the other day. I personally don't like chocolate and pb together, so I didn't taste them.  My mom said they were delectable though and DH's friend said they tasted just like a Reese's PB Cup.  They were pretty easy to make, the only complaint I have, and the reason for only 4 stars, was that they were so hard to cut.  I was only able to salvage a few because when I tried to cut them the chocolate \"shattered\".  I'm not sure how to cure that.  Next time I make these I might try to put them in mini muffin cups to avoid the broken chocolate.  Thanks for posting!","These were very simple to make and turned out delicious!!  Cutting them before putting in the fridge to chill worked great. We doubled the recipe and made 32 in a 9x13\" pan. Thanks Tonkcats!","This was a very good recipe, won the whole family over !!!!","Mmm! These are SO delicious! THe only difference I did was double the    chocolate! They are far better than reeses.","These are fantastic!!!!  After I mix the peanut butter part together I chill the dough, take my melon ball scoop and make them into peanut butter balls.  I then chill them again and dip the balls in the chocolate much easier (for me anyways;-) then cutting them into squares.  It's also much easier for portion control too!  Either way you wouldn't be sorry you made these.  If you're a Reese's lover, as I am, you'll be in heaven.  So what are you waiting for?  Go get busy.","SO easy to make and enjoyed by myself & my son. I had to break into pieces but that was fine with me. Thanks for sharing!","Very yummy. The only issue I had was cutting it up, and the chocolate didn't stick well to the pb mix. <br\/>But my little brothers loved it :)","Tasted like the real deal and my son loved it! Made it in leiu of a birthday cake for my Reese loving 5 year old. I used chocolate Graham crackers and not sure if it made a difference, but still yummy. Thanks!","These were very good. My pan was a 9x9 square which worked well for having a similar chocolate to filling ratio to actual peanut butter cups. I think the serving size on this is way off though. It says serves 6 and we cut it into 16 squares and found that to be plenty with how sweet they are. But they do taste like the real thing, only maybe a little sweeter.","This is the best recipe yet for these type of no bake peanut butter treats. Let me tell you that they are made even more scrumptious by using ? cup crushed pretzels and ? cup graham crackers. The salt that the pretzel offers is unrecognizable as salty but greatly intensifies the peanut butter flavor of these delicious treats. The pretzels for lack of a more creative or better word make the recipe taste so much more &quot;peanut buttery&quot; rather than just super sweet with an identifiable peanut butter taste. Also the texture is markedly improved by using pretzels making still a sticky but somehow also flakey product . Note - just adding salt to the recipe does not create the same flavor and texture as the actually addition of pretzel. Also FYI I wanted to make knock off PB eggs for Easter or at the very least a tray of &quot;truffles&quot;. I have been unable to shape or form any similar recipe for peanut butter cups until I found this one- and they taste and look great - BUT I did find that there is a method. First I used a combo of 2\/3 cup salted pretzels crumbs and 1\/3 cup graham crackers-added all the dry together first and mixed well. Then I mixed in the peanut butter first with a spoonula then with clean hands- I added the melted butter last incorporated with my hands. I was left with the perfect texture to create egg shapes, truffles, or press into molds. Fantastic !!","This was fairly easy to make, although I had trouble getting my chocolate chips to get to the right consistency to spread easily which then made it more difficult to cut. This does taste like a Reese cup filling and is really good but rich! Agree with one of the former comments that a much smaller portion is plenty due to the rich flavor.

I fried them a bit for some browning before baking. I was a little confused about the directions to \"broil for 15 mins\" after it said to preheat oven to 350, so I just baked it at 350 for 25 mins. Wonderful! Thanks tranch!","Family really like this. I have cooked it often.","Super easy recipe and tasty. The only thing I did differently was add a bit of fresh garlic to the spinach. And it seemed to take a lot longer to broil than 15 minutes. I put the baking rack on the highest position and it still took almost 45 minutes. And the chicken never browned. I'm not sure what went wrong there. Maybe the temperature was too low? I'm surprised I'm the only person who seemed to have this issue :(","This was exceptional!\n\nI was a little bit confused by the instructions to preheat the oven to 350, then later saying to \"broil\".  Maybe that's exactly what the posting chef meant, but the instructions just seemed odd to me.  I chose to bake the breasts at 375 for about 30-35 minutes.  I used a thermometer to test for 165 degrees.\n\nI also used fresh spinach for the stuffing.  First I steamed it lightly in a pot with chopped onion and minced garlic and salt.  Just as I was taking it off the heat I stirred the feta in, then proceeded to stuff each chicken breast a few moments later.\n\nDidn't bother with trying to cut pockets in the breasts.  I pounded the breasts out thinner and then simply folded them over and toothpicked them over the stuffing I'd inserted in the fold.\n\nFlavors paired particularly well with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette.","This was pretty good.  I added some homemade sun dried tomatoes which helped the taste.  Still felt it needed something...  chicken got a little dry on me.  Overall, it still was well received by the family.  Hey if my husband eats spinach..... enough said!","I love the idea of this recipe, just changed it a little.  I placed bacon on the board then added the chicken breast, put the spinach and feta in the middle and then rolled it all up.  The bacon keeps the chicken moist and adds a great combination of texture and flavour and you don't have to use the toothpick as the bacon holds it together well!!  I cooked this all summer at the conference center I work at. One week for 300 people!! Everyone loves it!  Thanks for sharing.","This was excellent!  I did make a couple of changes however.  I stuffed the breasts with feta and spinach and placed in a single layer in a dish.  I squeezed the juice from half of a lemon on top of the chicken.  I put the chicken into the fridge to marinate in the juices for an hour or so.  I then ground fresh salt and pepper on top of the chicken, put the Olive Oil in a large skillet and got the pan and oil really hot.  I then cooked the chicken in the skillet until it was completely done.  The caramalization on the chicken was awesome.  Thank you for a quick and easy dinner!","I was thoroughtly confused at the 'preheat of to 350' and the 'broil' instructions, so I just browned the chicken on top of the stove in a hot pan with a little olive oil. It was absolutely delicious!","Yum. I made this with fresh spinach leaves and fat free feta and it was fabulous. I cooked it @ 350\u00c2\u00b0 but it took close to an hour. It was well worth the wait though. Also, I marinated it about 4 hrs. Perfect.\nThanks for sharing Tranch!!","This recipe needs a little clarification as others have noted. I took the suggestion to bake at 375, it only took about 25 minutes in my oven and was done. I then broiled for about five minutes, but don't feel that was truly necessary. The flavors are great together, we just have to get the baking\/broiling time tweaked! I cut mine into medallions and served with stir fry garlic sliced baby portabello mushrooms, a side salad with vinagrette, and a nice red wine! I used fresh baby spinach leaves and also the crumbled feta cheese which had roasted red peppers in it, which comes in a package in the deli section. Was excellent for an early Valentines Day meal. For presentation, I think would be nicely served in medallion style over a spinach bed, maybe creamed spinach. Nonetheless, it tastes great! Thanks for the recipe, Tranch.","I really loved this recipe. I've never made stuffed chicken before and I'll totally be making this again. I followed some of the other reviews advice and marinated the chicken in buttermilk overnight.I also added some Parmesan cheese and a clove of fresh garlic (minced) to the spinach\/feta mixture. The only person who didn't like this was my extremely picky (doesn't like anything green) brother. Everyone else gobbled it up.

Didn't have the wow I was looking for but maybe that's because I didn't have the caraway. Next time I will puree some of the veggies like the other reviewers suggested to give a creamier texture.

I made this for my dear friend's birthday and it was a huge hit.   I used some wonderful dutch cocoa that another Zaarite sent me and it was dark, moist, rich and wonderful.    Exactly the kind of thing that I was looking for - thank you!","Certainly was the PERFECT chocolate cake! Easy, delicious, and not too sweet. SOO moist and chocolatey. I used this with caramel frosting (my fave!) and decorated it with rainbow chocolate bits- so pretty! Everybody thought it was 'perfect'- including moi! Thanks so much this recipe's a keeper :)","Loved it, I used a 9 x 13 inch glass pan and had to bake for about 45 minutes before the toothpick came out clean. Once it was cooled I iced with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting Recipe #89207 and used the full amount of cocoa in the frosting. It is an excellent moist rich cake. Don't let the thinness of the batter scare you, mine was really thin but it baked up beautifully and tastes great, thanks Sue for the recipe!","Great cake.Had the best flavor,and it was easy to make.So moist too.Thanks for this recipe.","This cake was just wonderful!  I frosted with peanut butter frosting and my husband has eaten half of it already!!!","This is the best chocolate cake I have  made. I made it for my little girl birthday and its gone like a breeze. It was supermoist and so easy to make. Slightly too sweet for my family and will certainly make it again. It's a real hit.","Made this and frosted it with coconut pecan frosting.  This is a sin for those on a diet. Whoops, I'm on the diet.  Worth every bite.","very moist and easy to make, will make again and again, thanks for posting","This didnt work for me at all.  The cakes came out with a crispy sugary top crust, which I had to remove before frosting.","A super easy, delicious from scratch cake!  I iced the two-layer cake with the Really Easy and Good Chocolate Buttercream Frosting Recipe #89207.  It was a great combination.  My friends thought it was a store bought cake.  I used whole milk to ensure moistness.  I'm not sure if this was necessary but I wanted to be safe.  The 30 minutes of bake time was perfect.","YUM YUM!! I made it last night and there are no leftovers..I baked in a 9X13 and didnt take it out after it cooled fo 10 minutes so it stuck a bit..Next time i will follow directions ;0)It didnt stop them from scraping the bottom of the pan ;0) Will use this recipe over and over again. Thanks for sharing","Oh my this was wonderful! I baked this for my 16th birthday and all my friends loved it! They kept asking me where I bought it and they wouldn't believe me when I told them I baked it myself! It's such a moist wonderful cake! Next time I bake a cake, this recipe will be used for sure!","Until tonight I had never made a home made cake in my entire life, and I must say that for my first try this recipe turned out beautifully.  It's just sweet enough, very rich, and very fluffy and moist.  ","Made this for my husband's birthday with no-cook marshmallow frosting on top.  He was pleased!  Easy to make, and high-quality cocoa really makes the cake.","My husband was in love with this cake! I made a two layer round cake and used home made chocolate icing.  The cake was gone in two days!  A great, awesome from scratch recipe. A winner in my house, will be made very often. Thank you! Try this cake out if you haven't already.","Awesome!  The best chocolate cake I've ever made!","nice moist cake, baked them in 2(8x8) square pan for 35min, and the top was underbaked! Very sweet cake, i will reduce the amt of sugar the next time UPDATE:baked these again, exactly 30min (2 8x8 square pan) and they were perfect I guess my oven temp was off the first time. Reduced sugar to 1 1\/2 c.  They turned out very chocolatey and not sweet at all.  Use #36547 for the frost (frost was sweeter than the cake itself)","HOW COULD I FORGET TO REVIEW THIS????? Ah! This is a GREAT fudgy cake and the closest to a box mix I have ever made from scratch. Took ten minutes in total, and the results seem as if I slaved away in the kitchen all day long. I made it without any frosting in a 13x9 inch pan and cut it into little squares and gave it away as a gift. I can only IMAGINE what it would be like with a nice Ganache topping or buttercream topping....mmmmm","A big hit with chocolate lovers.  Used Really Easy and Good Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (89207).","Made this for my daughter-in-laws birthday. A very moist and delicious cake.\r\n\r\nThanks Marg@Cayman Designs.\r\n\r\nBullwinkle.","This does not take too much longer to make than a boxed cake.  However, you do avoid all the non pronouncable ingredients found in a box cake.  And to boot, this is delicious and moist.  I cut it into small portions and froze them.  I now have a mini dessert every night for a while.  Thanks again Marg.","This was very good.  I frosted it with a tub of premade icing.  So easy and so good.  Now that I havemade this a few times I want to say you can add some instant coffee to the water to make a great mocha cake.  This has become the kids favorite chocolate cake to have when all the friends are over.  I even caught them having it for breakfast after a sleepover at our house.  Their reasoning was it had eggs and flour so it was just like breakfast food, go figure teenagers!!!!","My family absolutely loved this.  \r\nWasnt real sure about the whole water thing and it was very thin but it turned out to be one of the best chocolate cakes I've eaten in a long time.","made they into muffins, delicious!!!\nthanks for the recipe!!","I added a cup of chocolate chips to the batter, which melted when I added the boiling water. I made it in a 13x9 pyrex and it had to cook almost 45 minutes. Soon as it came from the oven, I poked holes all over the top and spread a container of premade chocolate frosting. The results was an intensely chocolate flavor in a very rich & moist cake. It was delicious!! I meant to add some instant coffee to the boiling water but I forgot....will try this next time. Thanks Marge, my family loved this cake!","What a lovely chocolate cake - so very moist and flavorful.  The only thing wrong is it disappears mighty fast!!  This one definitely found a place in my cookbook.  ","I just made this cake to have something to serve company tonight, It was easy to make, the taste and texture are wonderful, I must have not greased the pan enough or  tried to turn it out too soon or something because it fell apart when I did. I made a box cake mix for the company and we will eat this delicious pile of cake!","I made this cake yesterday and found that it was very good, but not chocolately enough.  However, it was very moist and everyone enjoyed it.  Next time I will increase the cocoa as I liked the texture and the ease in making it.","I can see why this recipe has so many 5 star ratings on it! Delcious and moist and full of chocolate flavor! I baked mine in a 13x9 pan and iced with <a href=\"\/51912\">Chocolate Frosting<\/a> and was a match made in heaven!\r\nThanks for the recipe Marg!","I knew it would be moist when I saw the addition of oil.  Similar to the chocolate cake on the cocoa can.  Frosted with cream cheese chocolate frosting. When the urge for chocolate hits, this is very satisfying. ","You're right, this is the PERFECT chocolate cake.  Sooo moist!  I made it with Dutch dark cocoa.  My family doesn't go for cake, but they went for this!  I frosted it with the \"Amish\" cake frosting\/icing <a href=\"\/44050\">&amp;quot;Amish&amp;quot; cake frosting \/ icing<\/a>; the combination was superb.  Add vanilla ice cream...!\r\nDon't go near this cake if you're on a diet, you won't quit eating it!  Thanks for the recipe!","I made this for my wife's birthday, and used a chocolate ganache type frosting. It was a hit.\n\nI increased the serving size to 18 and used two 10\" cake pans. Probably could have gone to 20 servings, though.","I am a moderately experienced baker, and this recipe did not turn out! The middle is still not cooked in my reliable oven\/pans. I made two 9-in round cakes. Recipe calls for 30-35 min, and I've lost track of exactly how much longer it's been but it's been at LEAST 12 min. longer than recipe. Now the edges are burning. I'd give it -2 if I could b\/c now I'm left with no decent cake for DH's b-day today. Either I have to REBAKE another recipe or try to salvage this one. BOO!","I love this cake.i just decrease the amount of sugar for my husbands sake.its very moist and yummy....","This is a beautiful cake, it is a runny mixture but be patient and it works out well. I was looking for a recipe that was suitable to use as a birthday cake and this was just perfect. Many thanks will be using again and again.\r\nchris","Very moist dark chocolate cake. I baked it in a 9 inch round cake tin and made a few cup cakes as well with the extra. I added as some reviewer said a few chocolate chips to the cup cakes. It is delicious. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1\/2cup and thought it was perfect. definitly a keeper. Will try with frosting next time.Thanx","A very nice cake, moist and chocolaty, It really puffed up in the oven but fell quite a bit after coming out of the oven and ended up looking very much like Fawn's picture. I put a chocolate fudge icing on it. I think it would be nicer with a brown sugar icing but the birthday guy wanted chocolate so chocolate it was.\r\nThank you, Marg.","This cake was excellent.  It was simple and quick to make.  I was very moist and had a rich chocolate flavor.  I ended up using a store bought icing because I was in a hurry, but the icing did not do it justice.  Next time I will try a dark chocolate ganache or a dusting of bittersweet cocoa powder.  This cake is good enough to stand alone, even without icing.","very good! keeps a few days moist.","All I can say is, WOW! I love this cake!! It is cheap and easy to make and it tastes soooo good. This is a keeper. Very chocolately, but not sickly. I am making this again on the weekend. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.","So moist it's almost like a pudding cake.  Very tasty.  After making the recipe, I made another half recipe to get 3 layers, as it is not a very tall cake.","I made this  fantastic cake for a 14 year old cousin thats been nagging me for some time now, for a chocolate orange cake. I followed the recipe except I replaced 1\/2 cup of water with freshly squeezed orange juice. The cake baked up high, soft and fudgy. I sandwhiched the cake with an orange flavoured and coloured buttercream icing, iced the outer cake with chocolate buttercream icing, rolled the sides in a premium dark chocolate vermercille and used orange and chocolate buttercream to decorate. My cousin was thrilled with her cake and shared a little piece with me.This cake is not only easy but also tasty .  I will be making this cake often.","This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tried.  It's official,  it tastes as great as it smells while baking. The cake is rich, thick, light and moist, tender and it explodes with chocolate flavour and has a wonderful texture. Thanks so much for sharing Marg, I love your recipes, they never disappoint.","Made this cake last night! I used this recipe - poured it into a bundt cake pan for 50 mins on 350 for a recipe for the bundt cake - oh wait and THEN made a filling of 4 oz cream cheese, 1 cup coconut,\r\nhandful of white chocolate, and handful of nuts. This is a VERY moist cake! VERY tasty! It was VERY simple to make! It was an after thought so Mr. Dutchy could have his sweets before bed.","The \"perfect chocolate cake\" is very true. This is the chocolate cake recipe I have been looking for. I wanted one that was dark and moist and sweet. This is all of those things. It is like, but better than a packet mix but without all of those additives and colourings. The dark colour comes from beautiful dutch process coca. I would recommend using the dutch process cocoa in order to get the lovely rick dark black colour.Easy to make - no alterations to the recipe.. Superb!","Delicious!","This cake was delicious!  I made it last night for some company, and then had some for breakfast this morning.  ; )  I baked it for almost 50 minutes in a 9X13 pan because the middle was uncooked after 40 minutes.  I used a chocolate drizzle on the top.  It was so moist and chocolatey!  Thanks for a great recipe!  ***Edited to add:  I made it again last night.  (The first one only lasted a day and a half before it was consumed!)  This time -same pan, same oven temp...- it only needed to bake 35 minutes and the middle rose like it should have.  Don't know what happened the first time!  It was just as moist and delicious!","This a very good recipe, I followed another review  and made it in a bundt pan and baked it for 50 min. To finish I iced it with a chocolate ganache icing drizzled over the cake. I also added choc chips to the batter- I forgot to add a bit of flour to the chips so they would not sink to the bottom of the cake. Next time I will make this in 2 round pans or a 9x13 pan. Thanks for another great recipe Marg. :)","Now, this is a real chocolate cake!  There is no question when diving into a slice of this dense, moist and deeply flavorful cake that you are eating ~ chocolate!  Easy to follow instructions for the perfect 2 layer chocolate heaven!   I used recipe #89207 using the most cocoa powder (3\/4 cup) for the darkest and deepest chocolate frosting.  Thank you, Marg, for a wonderful, chocolate experience : )","I made this for my MIL's birthday and it is definitely CHOCOLATE cake. I followed the recipe exactly and thought this was easy, just as easy as using a box mix. Two things I would have changed - I covered this cake in chocolate buttercream icing and it was so rich no one could eat more than a sliver at a time. We thought it tasted very good, just too rich for more than a bite at a time. I joked it was definitely \"Death by Chocolate\" with the combo of the cake and chocolate buttercream icing. The second thing I would have changed, also related to the icing - the cake did not hold up to a thick buttercream (was planning to pipe some decorations but used all the icing just trying to \"glue\" the crumbling cake back together!). When I make this again, I will use a \"lighter\" icing or glaze that won't destroy the cake or create an overwhelmingingly rich dessert.","OK, this was the first cake in a long time that I have made by scratch.  It was great, not dry at all (which most of the time when I have attempted a cake it was way too dry) and the chocolate flavor was just right for me. \n\nThanks for sharing!","I wanted something special for my Engagement cake, keeping in mind if it worked I'd use it for the wedding cake...WOW it was amazing. So easy to make and everone is asking for the recipe! Thanks... (I only used one pan and found it needed cooking for 55 minutes on 170c in my fan forced oven)","Very nice cake.\nFollowed the recipe but only added 1\/2 cup of really hot water.\nI cooked it in a 13*9 in a Rivel 18qt Roaster Oven since the elements went out on our stove.\nIt cooked at 350x40.\nIt fell but I opened the lid before it was done so it was my fault.\nUsed Lynnie the K's Greatest Chocolate Icing on Top.","This is really, really good! I baked it in a 9x13 glass pan for about 50 minutes, and the very center didn't rise quite all the way; but it was beautifully cooked - great texture, fragrance and flavor! I used an orange buttercream frosting. Using the juice and zest of an orange in the frosting gave it a lovely pale orange color, not to mention being a delicious complement to the chocolate. We shared with friends, and it was unanimous - a definite keeper. Thanks, Marg!","I made this for my daughter's birthday party.  It was easy and tasted delicious!  Several told me it was the best cake they EVER had!","beautiful! i made 2 9-inch layers and baked them for 30 minutes each. i think they may have been slightly undercooked, even though a toothpick came out clean, because the cakes were very sticky and i had to wait for them to cool completely in the pans before moving them to a wire rack. however, i got rave reviews from my friend. i assembled the cake with a layer of fudge frosting, chopped mixed nuts, and coconut between the two cake layers, and vanilla frosting to cover. it looks gorgeous!","I made this for my dad's birthday. I used this recipe instead of a cake mix for Ho Ho Cake recipe #11799. So good, will definitely make again! Thanks!","My DH says this is the best chocolate cake he's ever had.And I've tried a few!Thanks so much!","simple fool proof recipe with simple ingredients.","Just had to bake it when I saw all the great ratings! Wonderful moist cake! Most chocolate cakes are dry, but this cake was deeeelicious!! My dad thinks I got to start selling these! The batter is very very thin, but it turned out great!Best cake I've made!! mmmmm...","Outstanding!  Super moist.  Made half of recipe and still came out excellent.  My Husband loved it and he's not a big fan of chocolate.  Served with fresh whipped cream and strawberrys.","Very moist and delicious. Super easy! I didnt have enough cocoa or oil so i substituted with chocolate chips and margarine. It didnt come out of the pan well but that may be because of the alterations so everyone grabbed a fork and we ate straight out of the pan! I will definitely make this again and i will try to omit the cocoa all together for a white cake to see how it tastes...Ok ,I made a white cake by omitting the cocoa and it was delicious. I added a bit more flour cuz of he absence of the cocoa and i didnt use baking soda cuz i ran out. It wasnt as moist as the chocolate cake. I would add more sugar and vanilla next time.","I made this for DH's birthday. Both of us loved it. It was super moist. I used a store-bought chocolate frosting as well as  walnuts. Thank you for the great recipe!","Excellent cake! Very simple and gorgeous outcome. I made it today for my friend's birthday. This is worth every extra minute to make. Thanks for the grreat recipe! ^^","Oh gosh I can't believe I forgot to rate this!\nExcellent homemade cake , it was good enough to eat with no frosting as well! \nMy daughter made this one evening when we had friends over playing cards ... she got a late start on it , and our friends said they had to stay long enough to have a piece because it smelled so good baking LOL \nWent over VERY well , thanks for sharing this great recipe!:)","This is a great chocolate cake recipe that is easy to make and incredibly moist and delicious. I made this recipe but substituted very strong boiling coffee for the water, and a specialty dark cacao\/cocoa mix for the cocoa, which made the cake come out somewhat bittersweet but still delicious and chocolatey.","Very good!  I had never made a cake from scratch before, but this was very easy and worked out very well.  I also made it the night before I served it, and it was very good even though it had a four hour car ride before being served!","My husband insists that this is the best chocolate cake he has ever tasted. It is the best from scratch chocolate cake I've ever made. Dense and rich, and soo chocolatey.","OMG OMG SOOOOO DELICIOUS!!! I will make this again and again.","I bet this cake would have been delish if I didn't suck at baking cakes. It was my first try ever at baking a cake from scratch. I think I'll just stick to the box, for my boyfriends sake. The chocolate buttercream frosting recommended, now that was fantastic.","The flavor of this cake was great, however, I added only the 1\/2cup boiling water as the author noted, but the cake turned out way too crumbly.","Wow this is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had! The texture is smooth and light but its also a bit fudgey. I made this for my family and they were amazed! I made half a batch and baked it for about 28 minutes and it turned out perfect. I used a chocolate buttercream frosting to top it off. Delicious!","I have made this numerous times and it is always excellent and easy!  I get wonderful compliments!  Yum-Yum","This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made!  When you make the batter it is really thin but it makes such a moist cake!  Sometimes I will add a little more cocoa to make it a little more chocolatey.  hope you enjoy!","I absolutely love this cake. It is the best one I've ever had the pleasure of making. I tried it a second time using 4 ounces of melted chocolate and decreasing the oil by a touch, and the sugar by half. We liked it a bit better that way. But it most definitely is the best chocolate cake ever.","Very moist and subtle yet delicious chocolate taste.","This is delicious! Instead of making a cake, I made the recipe into cupcakes (made 20) and baked about 30-35 minutes. The results were amazing! I used the cupcakes as part of Baby Pacifiers (shower favors - #112525) and brought them in for a baby shower at work today. The girls all raved about them. They had no idea how easy this was to make ;) Thanks for sharing... your recipes never disappoint!","This was a fabulous, rich chocolate cake. Kids and hubby raved about it. I had a killer chocolate craving last night, and it all ended with that first bite. Delish, delish, that's all I can say.","Sneaking a taste of this right out of the oven, I was rather unimpressed. However, after being frosted and put in the fridge overnight, it was very moist and yummy. I most likely would make this again.","I loved this recipe! Moist and delicious. I might cut back the baking soda back to just 1 teaspoon next time around as I can taste a hint of it in the finished cake although no one else has said anything about it. So, it's 5 stars from this family!","Loved this! It took less than fifteen minutes from taking out the bowl to putting in the oven. So easy and fool proof!!! I halved the recipe and baked it in one round 8\" pan. Dusted it with icing sugar and served with hot custard. Delicious. Will definately make this again! Thanx for a great recipe Marg!!","I made this cake for my son's birthday and I must say it was the best cake I have had in long time!  I will never use a box mix again for this cake had more flavor than any mix I have ever made.","Super recipe! I used this with icing recipe 89207 and it was a huge hit with all of my family! The cake was moist and delicious and the icing added that little bit to push it over the edge into \"chocolate decadence\" using only ingredients I already had in my pantry!","This has become my chocolate cake recipe. I have made this cake about six times so far. Just love it. I use green and blacks cocoa-so I sort of think its kind of healthy. Also, I cut the sugar in half. Still taste great.","Everyone else loves this recipe so much that I hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but I was really disappointed by this cake. To me, it had the same taste and texture as a box mix (maybe because of the oil? I don't know...), and I thought it needed a lot more chocolate flavor. (FYI, I used the full 1 cup of boiling water, and I actually thought it could have been more moist, although maybe I overbaked it?) If I made it again, I might try swapping out the oil for applesauce and adding in some melted baking chocolate.","This was great. Very moist. Update: I made this again and had several friends request the recipe. When I made this the first time, I thought I made it wrong because the batter was very thin, but it bake up great.","great but it was very very rich even for a chocoholic like me.\r\nBut the rest of my family liked it","really really good!\r\ni like the top to be a little moist =)","Really moist and yummy! It wasn't too sugary like a lot of other chocolate cakes I've tried. I only used 1\/2 cup cocoa cause my family doesn't like stuff too decadent.","What a moist cake.  I've never been a big fan of chocolate cake as I've always thought they were dry and crumbly.  Not so. This is a delicious recipe....thank you for opening my eyes to chocolate cake....mmmmmmm.  This is a winner in my books since its so simple and basic ingredients.....thank you.....Stephanie","Moist, Moist, moist! I only used 1\/2 a cup of boiling water because I wanted to make a black forest cake out of it. Is sooo delicious!","This is a beautiful chocolate cake! It really is super moist, definitely the best consistency of any cake I have ever baked. I don't get many good cake mixes here in the Czech Republic so I will be using this a lot. Even my BF who has a thing against cakes loved it. The cake I ended up with was pretty huge for the two of us, but now our friends love us lots and lots!","If you're looking for an easy cake to make that's not out of a box, this is the one for you.  Great recipe!","Wow.  This is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever used - and I have tried a fair few.  I didn't have any white suger in the house (crazy - i know) so i used two cups of soft brown sugar insteed, and it worked perfectly.  Thanks a million","This was definitely the easiest chocolate cake I've ever made. At first the boiling water sounded peculiar, but it is the ingredient that makes this recipe special. I frosted the cake, but after tasting it I knew it wasn't necessary. I warmly recommend.","Excellent cake! Everybody loved it! I used vanilla buttercream icing and it was sooo good! Next time I'd like to try chocolate icing. The directions were very clear and this was very easy to prepare. And I got to brag that I made a \"homemade cake\" LOL! Thanks!","For the life of me I can't figure out what I am doing wrong with this cake! I have made it 4 times now and I give up. The first time I made it it was wonderful. Light, fluffy, everyone loved it. So, I thought, I should make this again!! Well, the second through 4th times I tried the recipe it was disaster. I have read and re-read the recipe to make sure I am doing everything correct and can not figure out what i am doing wrong. The cake is fallen, heavy and tastes terrible. I gave up trying to get the cake to cook through after 8o minutes. This one goes in my disaster file. If anyone knows what i am doing wrong let me know, because when this cake comes out right it is terrific, but when it dosen't it is TERRIBLE.\r\nWell, I decided to give it one more try, cause I hate to admit defeat, donchaknow. This time Yipee! Success! As the first time I made the cake, it was terrific, we all enjoyed it a ton. So, I a revising my rating and giving the cake 5 stars.\r\nWhat went wrong? I have no idea, but the last two times I have done this now it has turned out fine. Same everything...different result.","Delicious! Made this for DH's birthday along with recipe#89207 as Marg suggested. I live in a very humid area so took Marg's advice and used 2\/3 cup water. Mine did fall slightly as it cooled but was still quite moist without being heavy or thick. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","loved this recipe...tried it out for hubby's bday....was AWESOME to say the least.. i stuck to d suggestion of reducing the sugar to one&a half cups...made a mild coffee cream frosting...used two round baking pans...best bit is d cake remains really moist even after a day in d fridge :-)","Absolutely delicious ! ! ! I am a keen baker but since migrating to Australia my much loved recipe taste\/texture has not performed the same. I made this recipe for the first time for my hubby's birthday and everyone loved it.  Thank you for this deliciously moist recipe.","I have made this cake twice and it never stays around for long. This is the best chocolate cake that I have ever made. It was so rich and moist! I used 2 round cake pans and I used the full 1 cup of boiling water. Thank you so much for this recipe!","Yummy! Used 1\/2 cup butter instead of the oil, egg substitute for the eggs and the full cup of boiling water. Light, fluffy, moist and chocolaty. Will make again, thanks!","Good cake, made it for my son's first birthday party.  I didn't think it exceptional but moist and consistent.","This was divine. I substituted in applesauce for the oil and it was still absolutely amazing, just a bit lower in fat. I will definitely be making this brilliant cake again!","Wonderful \"from scratch\" cake.  I used 2 tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a little less than 1 cup of hot freshly brewed coffee in place of the water.  You don't taste the coffee in the cake, it just makes it extra moist.  I also left the eggs at room temperature and seperated the whites before adding them.  I added the yolks but whisked the whites a bit, with a pinch of sugar until they were bubbly. (I heard it makes the cake light and airy)  It was fabulous.  The batter was thin, but baked up nicely.  I topped it with peanut butter icing.  1 cup peanut butter, 3\/4 stick butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 4 Tbsp milk.  Perfect!","FABULOUS!! I been told I cook very well but when it comes to baking I have a horrible mental issue with it. I feel very intimidated by all baking recipes even boxed recipes. This is the first time I have ever made anything homemade without a disaster. Great tasting cake. Thanks for building my confidence for baking. Now if I can only master a homemade pie... (just a suggestion - you should add to the recipe that if cooking with a 9\" x 13\" glass pyrex dish the temp should be 325 degrees)","This was perfect! Created it for an 'Apple Laptop' cake for the first time! I now use it for any time I want chocolate cake. We don't use vegtable oil in our house, but sunflower oil works perfectly still, I use fine Italian 00 flour and the finest bourban vanilla extract, and always the best cocoa I can find! Really improves in the flavour!! Thanks for posting!","How fabulous is this recipe. It is so moist, even after being left out for days.\r\n\r\nI followed the recipe exactly, and put the full cup of water in it.\r\n\r\nI would post a photo, but all it would be is a picture of a plate with crumbs on it.","By far the best cake I have eaten!It is a very moist and somewhat heavy cake, my husband thought brownie like.  I used a Bundt pan and frosted it with the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting that is suggested. For sure a keeper! Thank you Marg!","erm...it didn't stay risen...maybe oven too hot or something? But it made a lovely chocolate brownie, which I topped with a slab of chocolate melted with some dounble cream...mmmmm yum!","So simple yet so good. If I could give this 10 stars I would. It has that perfect moistness that box mixes seem to have. \n\nWe have also tried it with less then one cup of boiling water and we prefer 1\/2 to 2\/3 cups. Use get a slighter firmer but still incredibly moist cake\/cupcakes.","So easy to make and lovely and moist. Thanks so much.","After reading the reviews I thought this would be the best, iot wasn't it was very dry and runined the lovely mousse I made for the filing. I'm a great baker but never do well with home cakes.","Absolutely delicious.  Made the most wonderful cake we have ever tasted.  Everyone LOVED it.  Very moist, rich, tasty.  I ended up using about 3\/4 cup boiling water.  MMMMOIST!","a very good cake though it wasnt that moist cud have been baked slightly long but neverthless very good i topped it with my Chocolate Glaze Recipe #253295 n it was really amazing it tasted  even better the next day thank u so much !!!!!!!!","Awesome cake!   So moist and good!   I make all my cakes from scratch, and this one is GREAT!!!!\n\nThank you, this is a keeper!!!","Awesome and so easy!  Thanks for posting the recipe.","Unbelievable chocolate cake-- I made this for a Winter Solstice gathering of 20 people and nearly every single person raved with comments like \"I find excuses to go into the kitchen to eat your chocolate cake,\" and almost everyone said it was the best chocolate cake they had ever eaten.  I am gluten intolerant, so I substituted Whole Foods's gluten-free baking flour and it was still perfect.","I made this for my son's birthday using Kingsmill egg sub in place of the eggs (allergy) and it turned out perfectly. Besides tasting great it didn't stick to my pan at all. (I followed an eggless cake recipe last year and it stuck to everything.) Thanks for the recipe!","I found this cake tasted better the second day after making it.  Don't know why, but it was awesome!!  If I had rated it by that first piece only I probably would have given it 3 - 3 1\/2 stars.  That's how much better it was after sitting.\r\nI iced it with the Chocolate Buttercream frosting recipe that was reccommended.  Next time I am going to try it with a Ganache icing just for a different taste.  Thanks for this recipe I will definitely make it again - my kids loved it too!","I made this cake and love it , except I added four eggs instead of two..next time, I'll try it with just two eggs and see if I prefer it that way.  I actually found the recipe in my Hershey's chocolate cooking book :). Delicious!  I also made it with the frosting that was listed in the book and in the back my cocoa can.  It can also be found here: Recipe #89207.    This cake is moist and delicious! I liked it better then cake in a box. :) Awesome!!","I'm usually quite sceptical about five star ratings but this recipe does indeed deserve it.  And I haven't spotted lower ratings with accompanying sour comments, not that I've read through all 139 ratings.\r\n\r\nA chocolate cake for a 9 by 13 pan was needed and, rather than convert the quantities and timings from my favourite recipe, I suggested this one, which is similar - along with the usual admonition that, as it's a US recipe, reducing the sugar might be a smart move.  \r\n\r\nThe 5 and 6 year olds demolished it in minutes. \r\n\r\nJust one suggestion.  If you have any treacle, try beating in one tablespoon as you near the end of stage 4 in the recipe.  Note for US cooks: It really needs to be treacle. Molasses is not the same ingredient as treacle, nor is golden syrup!  However, this recipe is so good, it's not begging for anything else.","I've made this cake several times and it's now my Go-To recipe for chocolate cake. It's so rich and moist it's almost like brownies! I use 8\" round cake pans and have never had a problem with overflowing. Thanks for sharing it! PS. Try it with frosting recipe #130623.","I've made this cake several times and will be using it for my wedding cupcakes and top tier of my wedding cupcake tower as a mini cake.  This was really easy to make - especially as it uses oil instead of butter.  I always have enough oil in the house!  I used 3\/4 of a cup of water when making it.","Great! Made this cake for my mom's birthday and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, thanks.","Delicious.  So much better than a boxed mix.  Will make this one again and again.  Used between 2\/3 and 3\/4 cup of boiling water as per suggestion.  Moist and delicious.  Frosted with delicious butter cream #261024 from this website.","Damned fine cake, Marg!  I used 1\/2 coffee and 1\/2 water, but other than that, stuck to recipe as written. Made a frosting from a recipe on the Baker's unsweetened choco. box. (Basically a typical buttercream) This cake was moist and fudgy and oh-so good w\/ a big glass o'milk. Thanks!!!, Adam","Not a bad recipe coming from Hershey!! I had to laugh when I reached for my box of cocoa and there was the recipe almost word for word... Here I was looking for a new recipe!! I love Hershey's but was looking for one with more a dark chocolate taste! Guess if ya can't beatem' you copy them right??? Becareful of copy right laws..","Oh my goodness, this cake is to die for!  I am not a huge chocolate cake lover, but this one is delicious.  My 14 year old granddaughter doesn't even eat cake at all, but she tried this one, and loved it.  My whole family just loved it.  I only used 1 3\/4 cup of the sugar, but used the entire cup of boiling water.  It was perfect.  I also added a cup of chocolate chips, although it would have been just as good without.  This is a super moist cake, that I will make often.  I paired it with chocolate sour cream frosting, also from this site, and it was a winning combination.  This frosting is not a sickening sweet one. It was just perfect with this cake.  If you are a chocolate love, this is a must try cake!!","I was expecting an amazing light cake but it turned out terribly. Really heavy, not much flavor, and not really chocolatey enough. It did seem a decent vehicle for a really good frosting as it isnt that sweet, but overall the cake tasted terrible when not disguised by the frosting flavor.","Beautiful!!!  \r\nI followed the recipe to the letter... Accept that I added a hand full of chocolate chips to the batter.\r\nI used the Kittencal's Easy Chocolate Buttercream Frosting\/Icing.  All I can say is Yummmmmmmmm!!!  This one is a keeper. Thanks!!","i dont know what happened,but the center of this cake stuck like carzy and was gooie like it was undercooked even though the tooth pick came out clean and it was cooked for 50 min. the sides were all cooked and didnt stick.so when it was all said and done it didnt look like much (crumbled pile of cake)but it did taste  good.","I made this cake with the butter cream frosting for my boyfriend's birthday. It was such a hit and came out beautifully! The cake was so moist and soft I had a hard time icing it. It tasted like a Duncan Himes cake even thought it was made from scratch. I would definitely make this again!","This was a really simple recipe because I already had most of the ingredients on hand. It had a really good moist texture and a nice taste. It wasn't too rich, but it was just right. I also frosted it with Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting which was delicious. The only problem I had was with the cake falling in the middle. I used two 9\" cake pans, so next time I will just do cupcakes or a use a rectangular pan. Overall this was an awesome and easy cake to make! Thanks!","I am making a second batch of cupcakes out of this right now for some friends for Valentines Day. The first turned out great; it was moist and had a good chocolate flavor. I took the suggestion for the boiling water and used between 2\/3 and 3\/4 of a cup and the cake turned out perfect. \r\nFor cupcakes: I filled the tins only 1\/4 of the way because the mix rises up a lot. I bake them at 350 for 10-12 minutes.","Makes GREAT cupcakes... Is a favorite at my daughter's fourth grade class. Teacher seems to like them too. I do cut down on the sugar by half and add 4 tbs of honey. Other then that.. This is the fourth time I made this in all sorts of forms, cake for German Chocolate cake, bundt with a glaze, round cake with buttercream* birthday party* and now cup cakes * 38 count* for a school's Valentine's Day part.. Ty so very much for this great chocolately heaven cake!","Have made this numerous times. I imagine this is someones Grandma's recipe.  Makes a wonderful moist cake just don't let anyone (kids) stomp around in the kitchen, or cake might fall. Boy I used to get it if I made my Grandma's cakes fall lol","I made this cake for my sisters birthday and it was oh so good!! It was the most chocolate-y and the moisest cake I have ever had! Even after keeping it for 4 days, the cake was still as moist as when I made it the first day. I have had people beg me to make this cake for them again and again.  I iced it with my chocolate fudge icing which just takes this cake to a whole new level.  Thanks Marg for the most delicious chocolate cake ever!","I made this for a birthday party when i had no time to buy cake mix.  not only was this cake better, but it was almost as easy.  Thank you for posting such a great recipe!","This was a huge HIT!  The cake is moist and just fantastic...it reminded me of the cakes my grandma use to make...I used Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting\/Icing recipe and I doubled that since I like a lot of frosting and it was perfect!  Even my hubby whose not a huge chocolate cake fan came back for seconds","I made this cake one morning needing a chocolate fix.  The ingredients were all stock items so it was a very simple recipe to follow.  I baked two 9 inch cakes for 50 minutes in a conventional oven.  They cooled quickly and were very easy to frost.  The cake was very moist and not too sweet.  I am looking forward to having a piece tomorrow (if there is any left over once my Hubby comes home!).  Just kidding.  The portion is huge!  This can easily be used for a family gathering and everyone will enjoy.  Thanks so much for the post.  :)","Oh wow ! I made it with 1 cup buttermilk in place of milk. I used 2\/3 cup boiling water. I also used cake flour. This cake is so moist. Recipe is a keeper !!","Looks very good.  I'm confused by the title, though.  What makes it Dark Chocolate?  Did you use a specific kind of chocolate powder, or is it just the concentration of it?  Thanks!","I have made this cake many times, and it's always been a favorite.  I made it today in a 10\" tube pan, and baked for 45 minutes.  Not a good idea.  The cake fell, and broke coming out of the pan.  I have one in the oven now in a 13x9 pan.  This is the recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa container!","Not so impressed. Maybe I didnt add enough sugar (seemed like a lot) but either way it didnt task much like chocolate. Maybe icing will help but I think I might just start again with a new recipe.","Really rich, delectable, heavenly...the BEST chocolate cake I've baked, shared and devoured ever!","Wow!  I baked this for work, and everybody seemed to love it!  I followed the instructions exactly except at the end I added 1 bag of chocolate chips to add texture to the cake.  After it cooled, I used chocolate mousse in  between the layers and buttercream frosting for the outside.  When we cut into the cake, though, it seemed to crumble pretty easily, although that could be my fault with the mousse.  Next time I try it, I'll be using a chocolate ganache and most likely leaving the chocolate chips out since the cake was flavorful enough and didn't need the extra chocolate.  Overall though, my co-workers thoroughly enjoyed the cake and they've requested it several times, so this is definitely a winner!  Thanks for such a great recipe!","This was a great cake recipe. I used Ener-G egg substitute, soy milk, and mint extract for half of the vanilla extract as I was making it for a Christmas party. My only problem was that it was very delicate - it fell apart when I tried to remove it from my snowflake-shaped cake pan. I layered the pieces with candy cane ice cream in a trifle bowl and everyone loved it so much we actually ran out! Thanks Marg, for a delicious and versatile recipe!","This chocolate cake is soooo moist. I used it to make Black Forest Cake and everyone loved it.","Rich and delicious dark chocolate cake that turned out as great as all previous 168 ratings! My DD boyfriend loves dark chocolate cake with chocolate frosting so I made this - my very first scratch chocolate cake. It was very easy and although were lots of warnings about the thinness of the batter, I was still surprised and nervous (I used 3.4 cup boiling water) about just how thin the batter is. No need to worry though, this cake turned out great! I frosted it with the medium version of Recipe #89207.","I made this for my friend's birthday party and everyone loved it! Now I'm looking for an excuse to make a cake again because this is absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!","Great cake all the way around.  I will be making this one often!","I love this cake.  It's the first chocolate cake, or any cake for that matter, I've ever made that hasn't come from a box and it turned out beautifully.  I iced it with mint icing and chocolate frosting.  I don't see a reason to ever make another box cake again.  Thank you so very much for sharing such a delicious recipe.","It's recipes like this that make me wonder why people even bother with box mixes! Not only is this cake rich, moist, and delicious, it takes less than five minutes to measure and mix the ingredients and pop it into the oven. I made this cake in a bundt pan and bucking tradition, I frosted it with Recipe #89207. It turned out wonderfully. I will be making this cake for many occasions, thanks sooo much for sharing this quick and simple recipe!\n\nAddition: I made this a second time and replaced the boiling water with boiling strong-brewed coffee and man, it turned out twice as good as the first time around! This time I glazed it with Recipe #89594 using semi-sweet chocolate. Amazing, simple, and tasty!","This was very tasty cake! I was a bit worried when I added the water because the batter was quite thin. However, I poured it into the tins and it turned out fine. I did use 8\" tins despite the warnings and they didn't overflow (but almost!). I had issues getting one layer out of the tin but that was my fault and not the recipe's. This was very good!","yummy! thanks for a lovely birthday cake for my friend. used 3\/4 cup boiling water, and it was lovely, moist and chocolate-y. =)","Really enjoyed the choc cake. and also the baking experience. I use 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 out of preference. and I like it that way. to avoid any sticking on the 13x9, i lined up parchments which get rid of the fuss of sticking batter, and baked for 45 minutes. i added in 2 tbsp of Milo which turns out to be great. The batter was thin after the hot water was added up. if you're scared for the batter to be too thin, then use 3\/4 boiling water. beat it, and toss it in the oven. don't think about it. it will turn out great at the end.","it was good, very moist and soft. i replaced the eggs with 1\/2 cup of applesauce and it was still pretty good.","One word - WOW!!  First off, I loved the ease of preparation of this cake!  Took me minutes to prepare!  Made this for my nephew's baptism and it was a hit!!  Used Marg's recipe #95416 for the icing.  Thanks Marg! :)","This worked great for cupcakes.  It made 24, the second 12 cupcake batch came out fine in spite of the batter sitting for about 20 minutes (the leavening still worked).  I frosted it with some ganache and got rave reviews.  Thanks for a keeper!","Usually I find cake made from scratch dry, however, this recipe is fantastic.  It's very moist and simple to make.  All I had was the Hershey's coco as the time, but it turned out just fine.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for posting this recipe. Love it.","I made a three layer version of this recipe yesterday and it was delicious!  \r\nIf you want the cake to turn out moist, be sure not to overcook the cake by even a split second.  I used the buttercream recipe #261024 and it was delish!  \r\nThis would also work very well as a cherries jubilee cake.","I loved this cake.  I made several other high rated chocolate cakes on the zaar and this one was my favorite, especially coupled with the chocolate butter cream frosting.  I gave my boyfriend's family a big chunk of this cake and they paid me to make another (whole) one!  Flippin' Sweet!","I am a 66 year old male.  I have never baked a cake in my life!  This was fantastic!  Tasted just like my mothers scratch cakes as a kid.  I impelished the recipe a little, by using butter rather then oil.  Also added 1 0z of bittersweet chocolate to the melted butter, and used a mix of coffee and water, instead of just water.  It was rich, rich, rich!  Took me 10 minutes to make.","My 10 year old daughter makes this cake all by herself.  And she makes it over and over and over again because every time she does people RAVE about it and it is gone in a matter of hours.  She bakes it in a bundt pan and sprinkles it with powdered sugar. Amazingly delicious.","I can't believe I haven't written a review. This is my standard chocolate cake. I don't want to go back to boxed. Turns out rich and moist.\n\nIt just takes a couple of minutes more than making a boxed cake.","I baked this for a Memorial Day BBQ, served it with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream and it was delicious, moist and very rich. I made it with Kittencal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chocolate Buttercream Frosting\/Icing, Recipe #89207.  There was a little bit of the cake left over but that only lasted a few hours until people snuck back to polish it off. I am definitely through making cakes from a mix...why should I when I have a winner recipe.","I made this yesterday for my out of town family. Very easy to put together and very very rich with \"Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Frosting\". Every one loved it. I did use a full cup of boiling water and didn't have a problem with the cake falling.","This was an excellent chocolate cake recipe. The cake was moist and worth the extra effort. I first made as cupcakes for my sons class and they loved them however there were alot of crumbs. Then I doubled and baked in my 18x12 pan for my sons birthday and it baked perfectly. Even with the large pan it did not rise to much in the middle. It was a hit from the kids to the grandparents. Thank you for posting.","This is a great cake.  Very rich and moist.  I baked it for my family and it was a huge hit!!!  Instead of boiling water, I boiled some coffee (not instant) and it was wonderful.  Thanks so much for this great find!!","A great, easy cake. My batter was thicker than most cake mixes, not thin like the description, but came out great. A little on the sweet side for my tastes, so I cut the sugar back to 1 1\/2 cups, and used 3\/4 cup of water. It took 30 min. in a 9x13x2\" pan lined with tinfoil for easy removal. I made four of them and iced them together for a huge double-layered cake for a goodbye party. It baked up into perfect 1\" layers with very little sinking in the middle. Thank you Marg! Will definitely be making this again when I want chocolate cake.","I made this for my sister's birthday and it was a hit. I used dark cocoa and reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1\/2 cups. I also subbed coffee extract for 1 tsp of the vanilla. Nice, moist and tender cake. Easy to make and delicious. Thanks for sharing.","Thank you for posting this recipe! I wanted to take a picture of it but, the cake was gone before l had the camera out. I used 34 cup of coffee and thaught the cake wouldnt turn out but, yes it did and very well l might say. The frosting l just wipped up a gnauch. Very tasty and fast cake.","Wow!  This was such a super delicious cake.  My worry with chocolate cake is the texture and tendency to be dry.  This cake was moist, had a fabulous flavor, texture and richness.  I decreased the water to 3\/4 cup as recommended.  I used a chocolate ganache filling and also used the dark chocolate buttercream frosting, 208959.  This was for my son's birthday party and it did not disappoint!  Children & adults both loved the cake.  My sister had a piece 4 days later and  said it was heavenly & unbelievably moist.  I concur!","Truly easy to make. Turns out light and delicious. Hard to believe only half a cup of oil is required for such a large cake. I was out of vanilla essence, so used 1 1\/2 tsp of instant coffee powder instead. Thought that 2 cups of sugar would be too sweet in the recipe, so I cut down to 1 3\/4, but I will go with the 2 cups next time. Needed to be a bit sweeter especially if there isn't going to be any frosting. This time I put on chocolate frosting and it was perfect. Thanks Marg for sharing","This recipe is definately a keeper. I made the recipe twice exactly as per the instructions and used it as a cupcake mixture. First time mixture cooked out and over the edge of the cupcake liners so the second time I just didn't use the baking soda. They came out perfectly shaped as cup cakes second time round. Baked for 25min. Added cocoa chips once the mixture had cooled down after adding the hot water.Made a Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting and the two flavours really complimented each other.Had no complaints about this combination only praise. Will definately be using this recipe in the future. Thank You :-)","I have made this cake on several different occasions and it has turned out great each time.  The cake is moist and a chocolate lovers dream.  Thanks for posting :) !","this is the exact recipe on the back of the hershey's cocoa can. it does make the most fantastic chocolate cake, the one i return to over and over.  i've made it using 1\/2 coffee and 1\/2 water, and using all coffee.  the coffee gives it an even richer flavor and we prefer it over plain water. YUM!!","Need more stars.  This cake was so good it didn't have to have frosting.  I just made a quick chocolate cream cheese frosting for the top and center of the cak.  My family and I loved it!!!  I did add about 2-3 tablespoons of Irish coffee liquer to the batter.  It gave it just a little extra ooomph!","I have been making this chocolate cake as long as i can remember.  Fool proof and very moist. The best chocolate cake in my opinion.","Yum! This is soooo good! I used it to make Better Than Sex Cake! I think the next time I make it i'm just going to make it plain and enjoy it.","AMAZING! This is the best chocolate cake ever... exactly what I was looking for... and delicious topped with some homemade chocolate syrup. I will admit, I wasn't expecting much because the recipe sounds so simple... but it is simply delicious.","This cake is wonderful. I made it tonight, and everyone in my family really thought it was delicious. It is VERY rich, and is a true, restaurant worthy chocolate cake. Best of all, it wasn't that difficult to make. Thanks for sharing!","Delish!","I made cupcakes with this recipe and they turned out beautiful!  I didn't know how rich they would taste without butter, but they were moist and rich.  The cupcakes sprung back nicely when I took them out of the oven.  They weren't too dense and not too fluffy and airy.  It was a perfect cake texture and tasted so amazing, I ate 3!!  I love this recipe!","This cake is FABULOUS, half of it was eaten BEFORE the dinner party! Thank you for sharing this recipe!\n\nI added one teaspoon of cayenne pepper, as well as one teaspoon of cinnamon to give it a nice spicy kick!  If you are adventurous in the kitchen give it a try!","Easy and delicious! My new chocolate cake recipe! Fifteen stars!","This cake is the only chocolate cake in my recipe file! It's amazing. Thanks a lot Marg!","I doubled the recipe to make a double layer cake for a baby shower.It was perfect.Everyone asked where I had bought the cake.It was delicious!","really easy and delicious! my cake cracked though.","Absolutely delicious- just having another slice now!! Very moist even the next day. I don't really like icing, but my husband LOVES it and ate the icing off my cake and the rest of the contents of the bowl. Have decided to make the cake one with icing , one without!! yum yum yum. We used Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting\/Icing made with whipping cream.","I swore I reviewed this already! Oh well, here goes...\nThis is my \"perfect\" chocolate cake. I'm a cake decorator (hobby, not pro) and this is my go-to recipe for chocolate cake. Perfect chocolate-y flavor and density. I don't know who made it \"first\" (I got it off cake central) but I love them! I've never had a problem with it sinking or cracking, and it tortes beautifully. Thanks!","YummY I am spoiled now.. no cake will taste as good as this.\r\n\r\nAmy:-)","What a fantastic cake!  Very easy and very quick to make, yet one of the best recipes ever!  It's a very moist and flavorful cake and my family loved it!","Wonderful recipe!  Very easy to make.  I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil and made both mini cupcakes and a round cake.\r\n\r\nThankyou so much for the recipe!","I was looking for a homemade chocolate cake that was super moist and tasted more like a box mix without all the \"yuck-stuff\" (ie preservatives, trans fats, etc).  Something I could feed to children and not feel guilty about! I tried A LOT of recipes, and this was the winner.  I make them as cupcakes, and I do have issues with them settling a bit when cooling, so I will take the hint from Marg and reduce to 3\/4 cup liquid next time.  A nice sub. for boiling water is hot, fresh coffee.  A flavored coffee, like hazlenut works well too.  No coffee? Swing thru a Starbucks and grab a tall (small) to go! I have topped these with my Crushed Strawberry, Raspberry, Chocolate, and Cafe Mocha Buttercreams... all have turned out yummy!  When making a batch for adults, especially for the office, they go nuts for the cafe mochas.  I top them with a chocolate covered esspresso bean... Gone in minutes!  It's funny to watch full-grown adults sneaking seconds and thirds with guilty little grins on their faces!!","this was super duper simple and yet so wonderfully delicious....i can make this everyday...and i made it without using the mixer...i merely used the ladle and it worked really well...quite superb texture...i even added in some grinded peanuts to add some crunchy flavor....soooo easy....will be a keeper in my kitchen...","I made this for my son's 10th birthday.I doubled the recipe to get 2 large and 1 small cake to make a castle cake.Everyone loved it.I', making it again today for my kids and to take to darts tonight.Thanks for a fantastic recipe that is going to be in my \"make again\" folder :)","Beautiful!  Rich and moist.  Going by previous reviews I was going to make a double recipe so the shrinking wouldn't affect the size of my completed cake.  Well I am glad I stuck to the single! It didn't shrink nearly as much as expected.  I filled it with a vanilla buttercream flavoured with boysenberries and juice and iced it with a chocolate ganache and chocolate curls.  Delish! Thanks so much!!!","Great chocolate cake!!!  Very moist.","Living in Costa Rica, ingrediants are not always available. This was easy and all the ingrediants were avaialable. great cake will definately try again. I did run out of cocoa, we get it here in 5kBAGS, WILL HAVE TO renw my supply thanks for a great cake. Oh, I did make it with splenda and it turned out great.","This is the BEST chocolate cake recipe, and its soooo easy.  I loved not having to cream butter or shortening!  I think \"slightly longer\" is the right word to use in comparing this to a box mix, because you just have to measure 4 more ingredients out.  It is also very moist.  (I live at 7000 feet and reduced baking powder to 1 tsp, and used almost 1 cup boiling water)","My kids were thanking me for making this cake for them yesterday - how could I possibly give it anything less than 5 star?  Very tender and moist.","It is an easy recipe to make. The taste is wonderful and rich. Very chocolatey! I used Hershey's cocoa and am very pleased with the flavor. Kids and hubby liked it very much. I used Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting\/Icing. The darkest version. The cake stays well in the refrigerator and is even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe.","amazing and soooo moist!!!!!!!!!! Great, easy recipie. Bye bye mixes","This was my 1st cake from scratch and it came out really nice.  Had to make some adjustments since I live in Colorado.  Did add 1 extra egg.  My cake came out perfect, didn't sink.  It is a little work but well worth it.","light, moist, delicious and easy. I used 1 1\/2 cups sugar. Next time I want to add some nuts (hazelnuts or almonds).","Sensational! I made this for my brother and sister's joint birthday and the family loved it. I used a chocolate glaze and decorated it with strawberries and blue berries, and served it with a thick quality cream. Very moist, and not overly sweet, or too rich. Will definitely use it again.","This is a really great cake. I was having a serious chocolate craving the other night and didn't feel like running to the store. This recipe was all ingredients I normally have on hand. I used dark cocoa and added some instant coffee to the boiling water. It was incredibly moist. Even now, two days later.","Finally found the perfect chocolate cake recipe!. My husband loves dark chocolate and most other recipes just end up too sweet for our taste. I used Hershey's special dark cocoa (dutch processed) and voila! nice texture, rich & delicious cake!. The only thing different that I did is I used orange extract instead of vanilla and added 1 teaspoon of rum & 1\/4 cup of roughly chopped 70 % dark chocolate bar into the batter. This is definitely a keeper for years to come... I can't wait to make one for thanksgiving and show it off. \nThank you so-so much Marg.","This is by far the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I used this recipe a few weeks ago for my brother's birthday --everyone loved it-- and am planning on making it again today.","WOW!! I am jus learning to cook and bake, im only 20 after all! But this is my first perfect cake!! THANKS A MILLION! Its the perfect recipe.\r\nIam soooo on top of the world! Everyone loved it and its definately a keeper :) thanks!","This is absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  The taste is incredible and it is very moist.  Goodbye to packaged mixes.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!","I am allergic to Dairy and this recipe was easy to use and substitute with Non-Dairy products.  Even with Soy Milk and Vegetable Oil Margarine, this Cake was delicious and got rave reviews.  I used a bundt pan to cook and had a seperate dish for extra batter.  Thanks for this recipe.","This is the best cake ever! I am a ten year old who hates milk chocolate and loves dark chocolate! I made this for Christmas Eve and asked my family to rate it from one to five and it was unanimous that this was the best cake we ever had. Even my brother, who is a very picky eater and the world's biggest food critic said he would eat the whole thing if he could. My compliments to the creator of this recipe. Thanks for the best cake recipe ever! :o)","Excellent, excellent cake. Moist, tender, not crumbly. I am doing this for a wedding cake in January. The first time I made it, it fell, but I think that I just opened the door too soon. Just don't touch it until you reeeally think that it's done, then check it. This fit two 8x2 round pans just perfectly. Yields 4 and 3\/4 Cups of batter, but that's deceiving. The 8x2 pans should take 3.5 cups to fill them once baked, but this recipe rises a lot, and split between those two pans it fits them exactly. \r\n\r\nTo determine how much batter you need for specific pans, you should use 79% of the ammount the pan usually takes.","Good, easy, homemade chocolate cake! I am glad I read reviews that mentioned the thinness of the batter, because  I was doubtful about whether or not it would bake properly, and may have added some flour to thicken the consistency. I was pleased with the taste of the cake, although the cake cracked on the top when I baked it - maybe it was my technique?","Awful awful recipe.  The water made the batter way way too thin, which caused my cake to completely overflow in the oven and make a huge mess.  But then when I took the cakes out of the oven, they completely fell to the point where there was barely any cake in the pan (less than a centimeter left in the pan).  I would use a bigger pan and no water, but I'm not even sure that would help.","Awesome awesome recipe. Turned out beautifully for me. I also added a cup of chocolate chips in the batter. This is my go to recipe now for chocolate cake.","I can't remember if I've reviewed this before, but I am here making this cake again and thought I would share my thoughts.  I LOVE this recipe!  It is the best chocolate cake I've had and everyone who tastes it agrees.  I stuck with the 3\/4 cup of water like suggested and it came out perfectly every time.  It does rise A LOT, so make sure you don't overfill the pan.  As for the 8 inch cake pans, I did use those once, too, but I used 3 pans instead of 2 and made it a 3 layer cake and had no problems with overflowing, although it did come close to the top of the pan!  Like others, I ice it with kittencals chocolate buttercream.  Delicious!","My family loved this cake, my son going so far as to call me \"the best cook ever\".  I made a lower-fat, lower-calorie version of this recipe by substituting splenda for baking (the one w\/ half sugar\/half splenda) for the sugar, egg beaters for the eggs, used skim-milk, and halved the vegetable oil, and it turned out very well.  It was moist and very tasty.  I will definitely make it again, and expect it will become my default chocolate cake recipe from now on.","Absolutely delicious! i would love to make it again and present it like in the photo (strawberries and nuts). what choclate sauce\/icing is used there?? could someone pls let me know. thankyou","Very good, chocolatey cake.  The only substitution I made was chocolate milk in place of white milk.  I baked in a 9x13 pan and it took about 45 minutes.","wonderful!! baked up well. i doubled the recipe and made 2 9x13 pans that baked around an hour. thanks so much!!","Thanks for the tips.  This was good, but my family and friends actually prefer the old Hershey's chocolate cake recipe.","First off-- if you do this as cupcakes be warned: it rises a lot.  I filled them up to where I normally do and it overflowed into my oven, causing smoke and then they fell b\/c too much was in the tin.  Also, be sure to grease and flour well (perhaps with shortening) because mine stuck.  Lastly, it really wasn't very good.  I ended up tossing it all (and having quite a mess to clean up from the overflow) and making my traditional chocolate cake.","This was terrific!  I used a 13 x9 glass pyrex and it was done in 38 mins (my oven is hot).  It turned out perfectly!  I had no trouble getting it out of the pan nor did the middle sink.  Thank you Marg for the perfect recipe!  I will be making this over, and over again!","As if this recipe needs another review! This cake was irresistable. I bought normal chocolate icing from the store and topped the cake with that and raspberries. I also used skim milk in place of whole milk to reduce the fat. Mmmmmmm.","Completely worth the extra prep time! I love chocolate and boxed chocolate just doesnt do it for me. I also like it with chocolate ganache and strawberries in between the layers. The strawberries are such a delightful touch of natural sweetness amist layers of richness. ","This cake tasted really good, but it completely overflowed in the pan. I only used 3\/4 cup of water after reading other reviews about it overflowing, but it still did. I am so glad I placed my pan on top of a cookie sheet or the whole oven would have been smoking. Because it overflowed I had all dried up batter stuck all over the pan. What a mess!  I will not be making this recipe again.","I cooked this for an hour and a half and the skewer still didn't come out clean. Turned the oven off and it was rubbery inside - no hint of crumbs or cake texture. Possibly (probably?) a screw up on my part somewhere, but I wouldn't make this again. The batter was so thin that if I stirred it once, it continued for four or five turns by itself!","This cake is great!  Very moist and very tasty  First time I made it we didn't have any icing and the 13x9 pan only lasted a couple days.  The second time we made a layer cake with a butter cream icing..wow!  I used a whole wheat pastry flour.","This should get 10 stars!!! I baked it in a 9x13 pan and cooked it for 35 minutes. I boiled 1 cup of water and used what did not evaporate. My guess would be about 3\/4 cup. My daughter and I almost decided not to bake the cake and just eat the mix. I'm so glad we did. I will no longer be buying those boxed cake mixes. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!","This cake made my Valentine's Day great!  This was the first recipe that was actually chocolatey enough for DH.  We used the frosting recommended and put fresh strawberries on top.  Just wonderful.  Thanks again!","Very easy, extremely moist, and went over well at my husband's birthday party!  I mixed up all the dry ingredients a few days early and stored in a ziploc bag.  When it came time to make the cake, it was easy to add the liquids and bake. I frosted with Recipe #33520.  DELISH!","I give this cake 5 stars, it was so good, not too overly sweet. My family loved it, even my son who does not even like cake raved about it. I have made it 3 or 4 times and I used 3\/4 cup of water also. I iced it with Easy Chocolate fudge frosting by Laudee #32209! Excellent!","I made this 2 days ago, and it was just finished. I was out of plastic wrap and it stayed moist the entire time.","This is probably the best tasting chocolate cake I have ever had, I am only giving it four stars though because I have noticed it is kind of a touchy recipe. I have probably made this cake about eight times, and only once has it turned out perfect. Most of the time it falls, or sticks to the pan pretty badly (but it's more my fault that it sticks!). I live in Salt Lake City at about 4,000 ft., but can normally get away without doing the high altitude adjustments. I'm not sure if my problems have been from that or not. I finally found that 2\/3 cup water and an extra half cup of flour work perfectly for my elevation and oven. I have tried using cake flour in this recipe (I do for most cake recipes), but this one really doesn't need it. The cake is already really soft, if that makes sense. It really tastes fabulous and chocolately, though. It is really moist and fudgy too. Thanks so much for posting, it was well worth the work trying to figure out the conversions! Oh, just one more thing I noticed about it sticking- I can normally just spray my cake pans with non stick spray, but this cake always sticks when I do that even though I have pretty good pans. If I grease with crisco and flour them, they come out much better. Just thought I would point that out- Thanks again!","O my - this cake was amazing.  I agree however that it falls in the center but it was so good noone cares.  I made chocolate frosting but it didn't need it.  This is SO MUCH better than the store stuff.  Very moist - almost like a lava cake.  I will be using this recipe from now on!  Thanks for sharing!!","Excellent cake!  \n\nPerfect with the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting :)\n\nThank you ;)","Amazing. I make it with the suggested frosting, and it's a hit every time. Wonderful recipe. Next time I make it, I'm going to try including some sour cream to make it even richer.","WONDERFUL! Best chocolate cake that I or my husband, and many of our guests, had ever had the pleasure of eating. But, do remove the cakes from the pan at 10 minutes. We did not, and ended up having to make another batch. (Oh, darn... eat the \"ugly one\") We salvaged one layer, though, and ended up with three. How delightfully decadent!","I love almost any type of sweet but I live in a family of chocoholics. I became supermom the day I tried this recipe. My husband practically ate the whole thing! I paired it with the Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting for the perfect dessert.","My families mouths haven't been empty since I found this recipe.  I've been cooking for 30 years and this is...by far...the BEST chocolate cake recipe I've ever found.   It's dark, it's moist, it's easy....it's fantastic !  Marg, you're a hero at my house...  LOL  Thanks for sharing !!","It's the two cups of sugar.  That's the secret ingredient.  Nothing like refined carbs...yum:)","Beyond fabulous. Instead of the boiling water as instructed, I started with a shot of espresso and added boiling water to equal 3\/4 cup. I also decreased the sugar just a hair (by around 1\/8 cup). I'm sure the recipe is wonderful as written; I just like to tweak things my way :-)  It came out wonderful.","Made this for my son's birthday...SOOO easy!\nMy husband wanted me to use a box mix and I argued it was cheaper and as fast to make home made.He was amazed at how fast this came together and the taste was fantastic! Best of all it was so economical.\nIt took me less than 10 minutes to get it mixed and in the oven, including  the pans preparing pans!\nThe flavor was moist and a nicely  rich  chocolaty flavor and rose very nicely. I choose to use a whipped vanilla frosting with milk chocolate shavings on top.\nWas a hit with everyone!","Moist, rich, delicious cake - exactly what I was looking for! I would definitely make this again. Very easy to put together and received many compliments all around. I topped with buttercream frosting and the sweet icing complimented the cocoa flavour very well. Thanks!","great cake!","Absolutely amazing! Moist and the flavour is astounding.This is THE chocolate cake. I made a double batch for 2 x triple 8 inch layer cake. I used 1 1\/2 cups of sugar (x2 for the double batch) and this was just right for us. Used 3\/4 cup of water. I made them in advance and froze the layers for a couple of days. I have not had the cake 'fresh' but I cannot imagine that it could possibly get better. So - it can definitely be frozen for GREAT results. Used Recipe #89207 which was perfect to go with it.","Fabulous cake.  I saved a bit back and cooked it in a mug in the microwave for a couple of minutes because I couldn't wait!  Absolutely delicious and really rich but not too heavy.  Took 1 hour to cook in a square tin but my oven is a bit erratic!","Excellent cake. I have been looking for a rich dark chocolate recipe and this fits it. I made another chocolate cake last week and my husband said ther was no comparison. So I guess I will be making this one more than just the once.","SOOOOOOO good. This was gone in a flash. It's the perfect chocolate cake in my opinion.","Simply perfect.","Perfect for what I needed, a not too hard to make chocolate cake that I could make in layers and frost.  Thanks.","This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe b\/c it is so super moist!  I found it on the back of a Hershey's cocoa can and haven't used another recipe since.  I use it all of the time with different icings depending on whether or not I am decorating it for a birthday or just a casual get together.  Nothing beats this recipe!!","This Recipe calls for simple ingredients and  is  very easy to make .  Super moist and Super delicious  , Thanks for the Recipe","Super moist and delicious. Who would of thought the answer to moist fluffy cake was a cup of boiling water. Dare I say it but this cake has the same moist flavor you would get from a box but you get to take all the credit and there is no artificial addatives and flavoring.  I baked mine in a 13x9 pan and 35 min was spot on for my oven. I cant wait to try your frosting nex time I make this. Thanks fo posting.","Absolutely wonderful!  I really enjoy making my cakes from scratch and this one is very moist and flavorful.  I put strawberry icing on mine.  Will never go back to box mix again!  Thanks.","I made this cake las night with the 261024 buttercream icing and Oh my gosh was it great!! The perfect chocolate cake. My boys really loved it too!","Just made this cake for my birthday, only substituting the flour.  Great cake!","Wow - so good!!! I was a little worried after adding the water, as the batter seemed so thin, but it baked up perfectly. So light, airy and moist, yet rich and chocolatey. I baked a cake in a 13x9 pan to test the recipe (took just about 30 minutes to bake) and in a couple weeks I'll be baking some 9 inch rounds for my wedding cakes. Excellent recipe!","Mmm....I made it in two 9\" cake pans and it tasted great. One of the great parts was that it leveled off. Usually my cakes are puffed at the top which makes it hard to frost and I have to cut the top off the level it...but these came out flat. It was also very chocolaty and moist. Definitely the chocolate cake I'll be making again.","I've never made a cake from scratch, and this recipe was not only easy but tasted amazing! The texture was silky, and the flavor was rich but not fake tasting. I made this with a strawberry filling for a friend's birthday, and already have a request for another!","This was sooo deliscious!!! Very easy to make..my only prob was when I went to take out of pans it fell apart but i think its because I had not put enought flour? But still it was great =)","Worth every penny and time i spend to make this cake. I used this recipe to make a cricket cake for my neighbor's father in law. It came out awesome. She said the whole cake was finished in 20 min between 20 people. it was a 2 layer 13in by 9 in cake. Wonderful is what i can say. Moist, dense and rich chocolaty.","perfect","Well this definitely deserves its star rating. I used whole wheat flour and so reduced the oil accordingly. It was absolutely the best cake I have ever had, so will be making it for birthdays from now on. Thanks, Marg!","Excellent! I made it for my dad for fathers day (a dark chocolate lover) and he was highly impressed. I'll be making this again!","This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I filled it with chocolate ganache then i put a butter cream frosting along the outer edges. I think out of the half dozen or so times I have made this this time was the best. I think the guys at 15th ces will love this. THANK YOU","Wow, dense, moist, chocolatey!  I did add chocolate chips like others said and they sank to the bottom so I don't recommend that (my fault).  It *tastes* incredible though.  I used frosting from Recipe #212496, and added some because it wasn't quite enough.  Great combination and very rich.  Thanks Marg!","I used the dark chocolate cocoa and it was SOOOO good. It was the best chocolate cake I have ever had. It was so moist. My husband said it was the best birthday cake ever and my family said this recipe is now a tradition!","Nom nom nom...This is so...nom nom nom...Yummy. Sorry, had to finish devouring the last piece while I was writing this. Made as directed, though with soy milk, homemade vanilla, and as Marg suggested somewhere between 2\/3 and 3\/4 C. of boiling water. Used on recipe #42282 and they were unreal together. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Marg!","Wow!  What a wonderful cake!  Even as it was baking, my friend was sniffing the air in ecstasy.  The cake was light and moist and tasted great with Kittenca's Chocolate Buttercream Frosting and a nice strawberry filling (Recipe #10045).  I added about 3\/4 cup of really strong coffee (rather than 3\/4 cup boiling water), which did a beautiful job of enhancing the chocolate flavor.  I served this during a birthday potluck and my guests couldn't get enough of the cake!  It was gone by the next morning!  Thank you for such a great recipe!  I'm pinning it up as my official cake recipe.","I just used regular cocoa and it was awesome.  I used a peanut butter frosting and it was so good.","I have made this cake 3 times this week it was very moist and simple to make .I would say it was the best chocolate cake I have made , I doubled the mixture and it was still perfect, I highly recommend you give this cake a go","This is very similar to the chocolate cake recipe my mother has used my entire life for cupcakes.  Easy and tasty, super moist.  I doubled the recipe to make several different shapes in order to build a train cake for my son's birthday.  It did overflow the mini cupcake and the popover pans (BTW, I don't recommend using popover pans for taller cupcakes - it really doesn't work well.)  The small fire in the oven and the huge mess to clean up left the warning about overfilling permanently in my memory!","great recipe!  great flavor!  I halved it and baked it in two 6\" round pans for 30 minutes...made a great little cake--perfect for two people!","This is Bellachef's daughter. I love desserts and I love this chocolate cake. Very moist and chocolately. As a substitute in place of the oil, use applesauce and subtract how much applesauce you use from the ammount of water. This is supposed to make it more moist.\r\nsunshine and flowers :)","I am usually a devoted Duncan Hines cake mix fan so I tried this on a whim. I've never had much luck with homemade cakes, usually too dry for my taste. It was excellent, I might just give up cake mix. I made this with a fudgy, chocolate ganache type glaze. It really hit the spot! Son and BF loved it, too.","Simply Exceptional. Need I say more!","This cake is very coarse grained(like bread) and lacking in flavor and sweetness.","I found this cake to be easy to make but really, I didn't find the taste to be that great. It was a little dried than other cakes I've made. It wasn't bad, but not the best I've had.","Pretty good cake, I was looking for a richer chocolate flavor though. It came out well. It did rise a ton! I followed the 2\/3 fill suggestion and I still overflowed. Also, I made one with no parchment lining and it got stuck to the bottom even though I sprayed it with Pam, so i would recommend taking the extra step to do the parchment lining. Cake was moist though and the recipe came together well.","I made this this afternoon for my husband's and nephews birthdays today.  It turned out great.  I usually use my mom's black moist chocolate cake recipe but I do not have a copy and she was not home to get it and this was the closest I could find.  I should have added the whole cup of water because it was a little dry with 3\/4 cup.  Thank u for posting such a greeat recipe.","Amazing cake! ;D I baked for exactly 30 minutes, turning the cake at around 12 minutes 'cause my oven's hotter on one side. The result was a moist, fluffy, and delicious cake! I used a cream cheese frosting and covered it with toasted coconut....delicious! A keeper for sure - next time it'll be cupcakes!","This recipe can also be found on the back of the container of Hershey's Cocoa - there is also a frosting recipe to go with it.  Very good if you like chocolate -- and who doesn't.","Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  I didn't have eggs, so I used applesauce as a binder like someone suggested.  Cut the sugar to 1 1\/2 cups, and used about 1\/2 cup of water.  I also made sure not to open the oven; though the batter seemed thin, the cake rose very nicely.  I finished it with a chocolate ganache and chopped walnuts.  Everyone who tried it couldn't believe it was 1- from scratch, 2-so moist!, and 3- so rich and tasty.  Will DEFINITELY make again.","Everyone loved it. Used Kittencals butter cream frosting. Delish.","This cake is excellent!  I admit it's the first time I made a chocolate cake :D even though I'm a long time cook and baker.  It turned out perfect and was also perfectly easy.  It will be my \"to go to\" cake whenever I want cake for any special occasion or anytime.  I used the buttercream icing recipe (not the chocolate one) and it was also delicious.  Everyone loved it, including my DH and soon to be 3 year old!","This is a winner!  Made this for a family get together and think it will get rave reviews!  I followed the recipe exactly and made a \"test cake\" for myself out of a mini heart pan with some extra batter ( I could only find my 8\" rounds!). The test cake was fab!  It turned out very moist and flavorful.  Next time I will use a deeper dutch cocoa, used Nestle's this time because that is what I had on hand and would love it with a deeper flavor.  I used Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream and made scrolls on top with white chocolate piped from a ziploc with the end cut off.  This is my new favorite chocolate cake!","You want chocolate? This cake delivers deep luscious chocolate in every bite. My son asked for a deep dark chocolate cake with rich dark chocolate icing for his 18th birthday. This fit the bill. I was one happy mama because this recipe made the birthday boy very happy. :) The icing I used was the one suggested. Mmmm, these two recipes go so well together. There is one little change I will make next time. I plan on replacing the boiling water called for with piping hot coffee. One other little thing...I'll be sure to use wax paper rounds in the bottom of my pans. It makes it much easier to get the cake out of the pan. To do this, just trace the bottom of your pan onto wax paper and trim away the excess.","A delicious alternative to a cake mix!  Thank you!  I used 1 cup of brown sugar because I was low in white and  1\/2 cup of water.  I loved the way that it didn't rise up in the middle and had a nice even top.  I iced it with mint icing and it was fabulous!  Thank you - your recipes are as wonderful as your pictures :)","Yummm!  Chocolaty and moist! I used Kittencal's icing as well!","This turned out great!  I used this recipe for my sisters' birthday cake, along with a cream cheese icing.  I made it using one of those giant cupcake molds and just baked it on a lower temp so it could cook all the way through without burning.  We will have the massive cupcake tonight, but i sampled a bit last night and it was wonderful. Crispy on the top a bit, and wonderfully moist and rich on the inside.  Thank you!","Full 5 stars of ease of preparation and taste.  I did use coffee rather than water and since I only had heavy cream, I used that instead of plain milk.  Very good and moist!  Will make again and again I'm sure. Love the dark chocolate taste!","I used 1\/2 C of water the first time and it was to much. The cake also fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan (but that is my problem). :) This cake is AMAZING to say the least. SO moist and just absolutely delicious. My husband doesn't like cake but he really liked this one. It is also SO easy--all you need is about 10-15 min of prep! Thanks for the recipe, I will be using this for a long time!","I agree that this is the same recipe that is on the Hershey cocoa can, but that said, it is a great recipe.  I followed the instructions and made it with Kittencals buttercream frosting and it was a hit.","I have made this recipe several times now.  First as cupcakes and then as a cake for my daughter's second birthday.  I have found that adding an extra egg and about 1\/4 cup flour keeps the cake from falling in a high altitude setting.  This cake has gotten rave reviews from everyone who has eaten it!","Easy and chocolate-y good.  I halved this recipe with success and made cupcakes out of the batter.  I wouldn't recommend this as the tops, instead of rising up like cupcakes, flattened, so that when I removed my muffin tin there was a flat layer of chocolate goodness.  Yummy, but not presentable. Next time I'd make it as an actual cake and maybe add some frosting. My bf says it tastes good as is.","Very please with this cake!  It's moist with a really nice chocolate flavour.  I just used regular cocoa and followed the recipe exactly (there's a first time for everything).  It wasn't as fluffy as others that I've made, but the taste totally makes up for it.","Made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was perfect. I bought dark cocoa to make sure it was a \"dark chocolate\" cake. I made a two-layer cake and frosted with Recipe #129329. No need to ever use a box mix when this is so easy and SO good.","Made this today....my first cake made from 'scratch'.  I made it with regular cocoa and used 2\/3 cup boiling water, which I mixed in using my mixer.  The result is a perfectly-tasting moist chocolate cake!  I will be making this from now on...no more boxed chocolate cake mixes!  Thank you so much for sharing!","No kidding! 325 reviews all saying the same thing and now make it 326. I made this cake for Jesus's birthday cake for our Christmas dinner and my family loves it. We had it with the Butter Cream Icing (tho i only made 1\/2 the batch) and we're still enjoying it the day after. It may even taste better cold. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. You've made a baker out of me!","Sadly, this one was not a winner for me... I was making it to use as the bottom layer of a Chocolate Mousse cake but I had to scrap it and make a different one because it just didn't taste that good to me. I did use Hershey's regular cocoa since that's all I had on hand but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe the dutch process cocoa really makes a difference. It seems most reviewers put some kind of icing on it too...so that might make it better. I made #31804 as the second cake and used some unsweetened chocolate along with the cocoa and I thought it was much better.","The perfect cake to indulge your chocolate craving. As suggested by other reviewers, I only used 1.5 cups of sugar and added dark choc chips to the hot water. I frosted it using the chocolate butter cream  suggested in this recipe.\nThanks Marg!","This is one of the best cakes I've ever made. I made it for my daughter's birthday. I torted the layers, filled the cake with chocolate ganache (#37844), and decorated it with decorator buttercream frosting (#95416). The cake looked and tasted like it could have been made by a professional. Everyone loved it! I highly recommend this recipe.","this is a great recipe because it is deliciously indulgent on its own, and easy to make. as well, you can easily fiddle around with ingredients to make it healthier.  I used whole wheat flour and olive oil and it turned out perfect.  Next time I will try it with a bit less sugar (my boyfriend wants it again - i don't wanna be responsible for him having to buy bigger pants lol).","Very dangerously yummy! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1 tsp of instant coffee granules with the hot water. First attempt at making a cake from scratch and will using this recipe from now on :)","This was by far the best chocolate cake I have ever made! It tastes great all by itself- even without frosting.\n\nThanks a million for sharing it!","Moist, tasty, and surprisingly simple. Even though the cake was made from scratch, it was not all that much more difficult or time consuming than making a cake from a box. Once I added the water the batter had a consistency of grainy chocolate syrup. Flavor has been fantastic. I used standard baking cocoa since I couldn't find dark chocolate cocoa. Cake has been stored in the refrigerator since I frosted it and three days later the cake is still moist and delicious. Frosted it with a peppermint flavored frosting and the chocolate\/peppermint combination has been fantastic.","Very moist, however a little too moist because I couldn't frost it without it falling apart! It has an excellent flavor.  I'll try it again and see what happens.","Very yummy cake.  Husband tasted a scrap piece (carved it flat for a layer cake) and said he thought it tasted like a brownie.  \r\nIve made it twice now.  Once as cupcakes for my daughters school.  Got rave reviews.  \"All my friends had chocolate mustaches!\" -Jada, 4yrs.","Perfect! Easy to make, even without a blender (I used a spoon). I forgot I had run out of vanilla so left that out, it was still amazing! It did exactly what the recipe said it would do. It tasted yummy and is HUGE!!!!!! The 20-24 servings is about right if lots of frosting is used.","Yep it's a ripper.   I've made this countless times and it always comes out GREAT.  This is a large recipe but last night I doubled it, and made two large ring cakes, which I joined together with cream then iced; it made a rather good looking birthday cake : )) and like usual was moist and delicious.   I have no desire to find a better chocolate cake recipe.","I LOVE! LOVE!! LOVE!!! This CAKE!!!\r\n\r\nIt comes out perfect every time...  And I've made it a lot!\r\nI usually use only 3\/4 cup of water. And mine always comes out moist and delicious!\r\nI top it with \"Kittencal's Easy Buttercream frosting\/Icing\". This icing is really easy and is a \"never fail\" icing...  I love it!!\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.recipezaar.com\/members\/home\/1462930\/IMG00174.jpg","Excellent!  Made it tonight for the first time and it will now be my go-to recipe for moist, delicious, EASY chocolate cake!","By far the best chocolate cake I have ever had.  Made this for my sons 2nd birthday and it was a hit there was none left and I'm making it again for my father's 50th birthday.  Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!!","I used regular hershey cocoa powder for this recipe. It's the exact same recipe as the one posted on hershey's box. After reading other reviews, I've decided to reduced sugar to 1 1\/2 cups. Turned our great, very moist. Used 9 inch round pan, and poured 1\/2 into it. Took 35 minutes. Poured the rest into cupcakes, baked for 25 minutes. The cupcakes turned out a little dry, you might want to reduce the cooking time if you are using cupcakes instead.","The BEST! A tip for newbie bakers who have difficulties getting a level baked cake, roll up a cloth napkin (do it on diagonal for the exact perfect length for 9inch pans) then drench in water. Wrap around the outside of the pan (secure with a cloth hair elastic) and bake as usual. You could put a level on top of baked cake and it would be perfect. I also used Recipe #78579 for an easy release. Made for my cat's 10th birthday. Thanks for posting!","this was a big hit! used hot coffee instead of the boiling H20 (about 3\/4 cup) and less salt. Used Kittencals icing with LOTS of cocoa,http:\/\/www.recipezaar.com\/Kittencals-Chocolate-Buttercream-FrostingIcing-89207!  Wasnt quite enough icing so make extra!","This has been my go-to chocolate cake for a few years now, and I am just now rating it!! It is amazing, and my husband goes crazy every time I make it!! I just made it again yesterday for an early valentines treat, and it came out as good as ever! I use Kittencal's Chocolate Buttercream frosting and it goes so perfectly!! It is always the perfect amount for my two layer cake! Thanks for the great recipe!","Made this as the cake for recipe 11799 and it turned out great.  I got lot of requests for the recipe.  Thanks, I'm sure I will make again.","How can a person love a food as passionately as I love this cake? It is positively sinful how delicious this turned out. Turned it into a football shaped cake for a Super Bowl party. Almost too moist to frost but I somehow managed. \nThanks for another great recipe!","My life is complete, now that I have this cake recipe. I don't know how I ever lived without it. 41 years, wasted, until now. Bless you!\n\nI layer this moist cake with recipe#11799 \"ho ho\" filling; then I use my favorite homemade chocolate frosting to cover the entire cake.\n\nThis is heaven. Truly.","Could it be anything else but 5 *****?? Extremely easy to make and good texture. I sliced into 3 layers and filled with chocolate mousse and fresh cream and it was absolutely delicious! Have a feeling I will be making this often. Thanks Marg - a winner!!  Edited Feb '10 to say I have made this 4 times now and the recipe is actually foolproof.  Most recently made for my sons birthday - split and filled with sweetened cream and covered in kiwi and raspberries. See photo. Thanks again","This is a great recipe both dense and moist and easy.  I tried to bake it in one 9 inch springform pan and I don't reccomend it.  I had to leave it in the oven too long to cook it and that made the edges dry and they broke off.  Nothing that I could not fix with icing but the 2 pans recommended is the way to go.","Very good cake! Simple, not time consuming, and very versatile. I frosted it with a peanut butter buttercream frosting and it turned out fantastic! I think next time I'll add chocolate chips to it :-) \nThanks a bunch!","This recipe is definitely a keeper. It's so easy to make because the ingredients are almost always on hand. Thanks for posting this great recipe!","Yum!!!  I've made the cake 4 times now.  Though I've had a few problems with the center falling, I've found that using 2\/3 cup boiling water worked best for me.  This time I made it with cake flour to see if it helped with the center (1 & 3\/4 cup + 2 1\/2 tbls.)  It worked.  Love the recipe!  I pair this with Satin Chocolate frosting #12176.   Beautiful & Scrumptious!","I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was scrumptious!!! I can't have dairy so I used soymilk and I went the 2\/3 C. water route. It's a super moist cake so be sure the grease and flour the pans well- I had so trouble getting it out in one piece. I frosted it with a marshmallow fluff and chocolate fudge- Heavenly!","Very good moist chocolate cake! I used 2\/3 cups hot water and made cup cakes with the batter and had no trouble with the centre falling.This was very good with a Vanilla Icing!","I made a three layer cake with this recipe for Thanksgiving with Kittencal's chocolate icing recipe and fresh raspberry sauce. It was a huge hit! The cake it amazingly moist! I snuck in just a peck of ground red pepper to give it a tiny punch. Only a few people picked up on it, but those that did loved the extra something. Thanks!","Wow, what an awesome cake.  I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake but thought I'd make this for our family easter lunch yesterday.  Definately the best chocolate cake I've ever had and everyone else raved about it too.  \r\nI greased, sugared and floured my tin which gave a lovely sugar crust to the cake which was great as I didn't ice the cake just served it with whipped cream.\r\nThanks for such a great recipe Marg.","Fabulous!! Made this with a raspberry sauce filling and standard buttercream. I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups and it was plenty sweet.","Soo good!  I used this recipe in place of the cake mix for Better Than Sex Cake IIi Recipe #3595 and it was a huge hit.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Really, I don't find it tougher than a cake mix, and it's so ridiculously much better.","Excellent!  Followed this recipe exactly, using Dutch Process chocolate.  Easy recipe, which is a plus.  Topped this off with Italian Buttercream and an Oreo filling.  Huge hit!","Great Cake!","This took NO time at all! I read through sooo many of the reviews and got really excited to make this cake and it still went above and beyond my expectations! I used 1 1\/2 cups of sugar and 3\/4 cup boiling water.. also added a tiny bit of instant coffee for a little oomph. The cake is actually still cooling down right now, but I used a bit of the batter to make mini chocolate cupcakes and those are DELICIOUS! Only took 10 minutes for those to bake, then I topped those with some frosting (89207) and chocolate sprinkles and oh man, I am so excited to share both the cake and cupcakes with everyone. Baked the cake in a rectangular pan (mine was a touch smaller than 13x9 so it only took like 32 minutes to be perfect) The cake hasn't sunk at all! Rose beautifully and it's still ginormous! Can not wait to ice it and dive in. I'll have to try a round layered cake next time too! Thank you so much!!! :)","I have used this recipe twice, with wonderful results! The cake is so moist and fluffy, not to mention delicious. I have cupcakes in the oven right now... I thought I'd steal your dad's idea and freeze them. ;) Thanks so much for posting this!","wonderful cake! Easy and delicious! I wouldn't reccomend using this recipe for cupcakes they are really flat on top instead of round and pretty, but in a sheet cake it turns out wonderful! I used a whole cup of water and it stayed very moist! thanks for posting","This is like the Hershey's cake recipe I've been using for years, because I did use the regular unsweetened cocoa as I didn't have dark or dutch processed (can't wait to try that way) and DH doesn't like dark chocolate and it was for his bday.  Turned out yum as usual;  I halved the recipe and made it in a glass 8x8 dish for 35 min. and subbed almond extract for the vanilla (as I usually do) and added just a splash of vanilla extract.  It turned out just as good as when I make it in a 13x9. Thanks for posting!","The cake is perfect. moist, soft , texture is just what you want, it just melts in the mouth. i did have to keep it for 45 mins, i think its just my oven, and i used 3\/4 glass water at the end.. on the whol;e everyone licked their plates even my  2 year old son.. \n\ni tried the buttercream frosting with regular sugar since i didnt have confectioners sugar.. came grainy, so next time will be doing just as per the recipe.. great for a birthday cake too will  be making the same for my son's 2nd.. Thank you for the recipe","Perfect chocolate cake!  I can't believe I ever used to use cake mix - this is worlds better!  I've used this recipe for cupcakes, tier cakes, and sheet cakes - all have come out wonderfully.  Perfectly moist and soft without falling apart when you work with it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!","exactly what I was looking for. cool beans :D","Absolutely no-fail chocolate cake that's moist and chocolatey. I reduced the sugar just a bit. Instead of making a standard 9 in cake, I wanted to do them in individual small sizes so I baked mine in large ramekin cups and they turned out beautiful and very cute. This is going to be my go-to chocolate recipe from now on.","I know that I'm in the minority but this recipe did not work out for me at all.  I made 48 mini cupcakes and 12 regular sized with this recipe and they turned out hard as a rock and crumbly.  I couldn't even get the paper wrappers off of them.  I didn't care for the flavor. That might have been the cocoa I used but I tend to think not as it tastes great when I make Recipe #32204.  I ended up throwing it all away and scraping my pans because of the overflow.  This may turn out if you are making a pan cake but I do not recommend it for cupcakes.","Great for cupcakes! It made 24 (slightly overflowing) cupcakes for my sons birthday party.  They turned out great.  I baked mine for 15min.  I checked them at 10 min.  Mine did not fall very much but it was super hot in my house (I have no ac) and very humid...so maybe that helped? Don't know, but this is a great chocolate cake.","This is the BEST chocolate cake!! WAY BETTER than a box mix!! DH says it's \"KILLER\"( that means perfect!!) LOVE IT!!","Great cake! I made it into 31 cupcakes and baked for about 15 minutes on 350.  Very moist and great flavor. Thanks, Marg!","It was a hit! I took another rater's suggestion and used only 1 and a half cups of sugar because I layered the cake with chocolate mousse and covered it with chocolate ganache so I knew that the cake didn't need to be sweet with all the other components.  It came out great! My guests were impressed and actually complimented the cake part itself.  I forgot to take a picture and I really regret it because it came out beautiful for my first cake not out of a box.","This is an excellent chocolate cake! I halved this recipe and it made 16 regular sized cupcakes. Baked at 350* for around 14 minutes and they came out prefect and moist! I just tasted one fresh out of the oven and it is awesome even without frosting! I can't imagine how delicious they'll be with some homemade vanilla mint frosting! Thank you for this keeper recipe!","This is an amazing cake! It's just about the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Very easy to make and it's just so delicious! I highly recommend anyone thinking of making it. It's so moist! I chose to make a filling for this and it turned out absolutely wonderful!!Thanks, Marg, for a wonderful cake, my new favorite! This is definately a keeper!","WOW! I used regular (not dark) baking cocoa powder and 2\/3 cups boiling water but otherwise followed the recipe exactly to make 36 cupcakes. For cake batter from scratch, this was so easy! For me, they took a bit longer to bake (about 20 minutes at 350F) than some reviews said, although it might be my oven. Some sunk a little in the middle but that just meant I had to add extra frosting ;) Everyone is gobbling these up and raving about how good they are!!! Great texture, very moist. I will surely be making this recipe again soon!","Awesome and this is really pretty easy and it is also ingredients that I have in my pantry.  This cake was so moist.","UPDATE 8\/23\/10<br\/>I've been making this recipe everytime I want chocolate cake that's amazing :) The BEST is when Sprouts has their double dutch-processed cocoa powder in for the holidays, otherwise it's just the tollhouse cocoa powder.<br\/><br\/>I am making cupcakes for my diabetic father, and I tried this with Stevia in the Raw -- Noooo. It gives the batter an odd taste, which was very disappointing. <br\/><br\/>So I switched back to Splenda! I used 1\/2 cup of the brown sugar Splenda, and 1\/2 cup of the Splenda for baking. Plenty sweet and still fluffy and fairly moist. I went with a full cup of the boiled water, which is what I believe gives this the moistness. And so there you go! :) It can be made with Splenda, just take the total amount of sugar down to 1 cup. Like I said, very sad about the Stevia not working, but I've always heard mixed reviews on it. Maybe one day there will be a good sugar substitute without dextrose or maltdextrin and sucralose snuck in. I hate to think what this does to the body. <br\/><br\/>Till then, for me and my DH, it'll be just regular sugar in moderation. One day I'll try this with raw sugar and see how it does -- till then, STILL AN AWESOME RECIPE :D","I found this too sweet and not chocolatey enough.","Great cake!  So moist!! I never thought I could make a cake that was more moist then some of the box cakes because mine always come out so dry.  Not this one though, it was perfect!! The only thing I'll do differently next time is be more generous with the pan prep.  I was pretty skimpy with the grease and flour and I had a little bit of a hard time getting it out (my own fault, not the recipes fault). Awesome cake recipe that I will definitely use again!!","If I could give this recipe more stars, I would!  The cake turned out to be so moist and delicious, and is so much better than the cakes from a box.  I put peanut butter frosting on top, and they were a hit.","The best!<br\/><br\/>I'm glad I made a double batch though, because it didn't rise much at all. I used two 9 by 13 inch cake pans (the air bake kind) and both of them ended up about 2\/3 full after baking. <br\/><br\/>YUMMY!!!","I followed the directions exactly, used 3\/4c boiling water and baked for 40min. When I went to take it out it was still sloppy and never set up. I baked it for an additional 10 minutes and took it out and it was still sloppy. Don't know why it didn't work!","OH DEAR, this cake was, I dont know how to say it was. Excelent, superb, wonderfull, scrumptious?????????????   I dont know, it was gone as fast as I couls serve it.  I loved it and will be making it again, infact for my daughters 3rd birthday.  I dont bake so I tend to buy a cake, or have one made from the baker, costing me ALOT of money. This came out wonderfully. I used it with 89207  I think is the number, for the frosting.  Wonderfull, will make it again and again. <br\/>Thankyou, next time I will try the dutch cocoa","Wonderful cake. I used 2\/3 C of strong hot coffee in lieu of the water. I also used Trader Joe's unsweetened cocoa powder. I filled it with a raspberry\/blueberry filling (#152347) and topped with a chocolate buttercream frosting. Two 9in cake pans baked perfectly for 30 minutes in my oven. Word of warning: this cake is little sticky...cool it on your wire rack with caution.","Great Great Great Cake","The best cake recipe ever! So easy to make & the cake is extremely moist. Next time I am thinking about trying this recipe as cupcakes.","This makes an extremely moist and chocolatey cake. It's very easy to make too. I made it as 2 x 9 inch rounds and sandwiched them together with some of my favourite buttercream icing. I found that it doesn't hold together very well like this so I think next time I will try making it as a Tray bake and there certainly will be a next time. Thanks very much for sharing.","Awesome cake!!  I made it for my in-laws (chocolate cake lovers!), and they said it was the best chocolate cake they've ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly, including the one full cup of water, and it turned out perfectly.  You will LOVE this cake!","Moist and flavorful. I made this for a friend and decided that I *do* like chocolate cake after all!","This cake had so many good reviews, I'm wondering where mine went wrong.  It looked good coming out of the oven, but deflated quite a bit upon cooling.  The top was very crumbly--hard to spread frosting on, and the taste just average.  I'm not trying to plug one of my own recipes, but Moist Chocolate Cake (#2766846) is hands down more delicate, tastier, attractive, and most important--pretty much fool-proof.  The recipes are similar--after trying both, I'll stick with my own.","Excellent recipe. So moist!! If it seems the center is not cooked after 30 min, just let it some extra 10 min low heat. Followed the recipe and only subbed coffee for boiling water. Delicious!","This was a disappointment for several reasons.  First of all, it was the first cake that did not come neatly out of my pan (yes, it had been generously greased, yes I let it cool first)...  so, I used one layer (in the pan) for my daughter's birthday cake, and ended up turning the other into cake balls because it came out in a million pieces.  Secondly, it tasted fine.  But not as wonderful as I'd expect with the ratings it's gotten.","This cake was amazing! Actually almost too good, I couldn't keep my hands off of it. I didn't have any of the dutch chocolate or whatever, I just used regular baking cocoa but it was still very good.","Incredibly moist and not too sweet... best chocolate cake I've ever had!","I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to make a friend's wedding cake. We tried several chocolate cake recipes, including this one. We had two finalists: this recipe and another, more complex cake. We actually took the cakes to a restaurant and had others help with the decision. Hands down, this cake was the winner!! Guests at the wedding also loved it and kept complimenting me. I made this cake again for a friend's baby's first birthday and several people said it was the best cake I had made to date! It's so moist and chocolatey.<br\/>The one change i did make was to use 3\/4 cup strong coffee (espresso works great) instead of just the hot water. It adds another dimension of deliciousness!","This is the best chocolate cake ever!  Sometimes I add buttermilk and it still turns out great.  I will use this recipe forever!  Thank you!","We've just finished celebrating my wee man's 3rd birthday and once again this cake was amazing.  I've used this recipe often since first discovering it's magnificence :)  It's always, always a hit.  I usually make up 3x this recipe and split it between 2 10\" round cake tins and use the remainder mixture for cupcakes for ourselves (there's NEVER any leftovers on the day!!!).  I generally have to cook the cakes for about an hour, always keeping them in the oven until a skewer comes out clean.  I use 2x the med-dark recipe #208959 chocolate buttercream frosting to fill and ice the cake then decorate from there.  It's absolutely devine.  So rich and moist and so quick and easy to prepare!  <br\/>Love it!!!","moist,yummy","Definitely the best chocolate cake ever. I've made it twice now and have gotten rave reviews both times! The only warning I would give is to be careful using cake flour because this cake is so moist that when you use cake flour, it practically falls apart when you try to serve it.","Recipe was easy to follow. Used 3\/4 cup boiling water. Used unbleached cake flower instead of all-purpose.<br\/><br\/>Cake was moist and fluffy. However, it did not have much chocolate flavor. I would reccomend adding the cocoa powder to the boiling water to release more chocolate flavor, which is what I will try next time.","FINALLY...after various recipes....I have been able to make the perfect chocolate cake...thanks to this recipe.. its simple and easy to prepare and soooooooo very moist......thank you Marg...this is something im going to use henceforth for all my cake recipes....just wondering now if i can manage an eggless cake like this!!!!","A~MAZ~ING!!!! Wild reviews from many critical pallates. \"Best Chocolate Cake I've ever had!\", \"Your best yet!\", and \"I'm stealing another piece for later on!\" plus many more. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I used chocolate icing to top it off, but the cake stole the show, for sure.","I have been searching for a chocolate cake recipe for a while. Believe it or not, it's been difficult to find one! <br\/>I found this recipe, read the reviews and decided to give it a try for my sister's birthday. <br\/>I'm so happy I did!! This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had. I'm obsessed!! <br\/><br\/>My only issue was with the bake time, it wasn't exactly 30 - 35 minutes, but that could be for various reasons. <br\/><br\/>You really won't be disappointed with this recipe!!","This was a moist and fluffy cake -- it didn't collapse after taking out of the oven as i feared it would. However it lacks the richness that i look for in chocolate cakes -- owing i think to the fewer eggs used and no butter. Also, i substituted espresso coffee for the water, which turned the cake a bit more bitter, losing much of the sweetness. A tip to those wishing to use coffee -- add more sugar to the mixture, or substitute only half the water. Instead of a chocolate frosting, I whipped up a creamy chocolate sauce and smothered a cake slice with the warm sauce -- a fantastic idea, it seemed, and added the richness that was lacking in the cake.","Absolutely fantastic - moist and very chocolatey. Tops my my grandmother's famous buttermilk chocolate cake, which my mom & I have never quite been able to master, and is extremely simple & fool-proof.  Don't believe the disclaimer about the time it may take to make this, in my book, no recipe you can prep in the time it takes the oven to preheat is too long :)","Fantastic.  I used regular cocoa, not the dark cocoa, but I'm sure it would be great either way. My sister in law asked for the recipe...it got rave reviews.","A very good & moist chocolate cake. Baked it yesterday & was so delighted with the end result. I just sifted the flour,rising agents & cocoa together before mixing together. Instead of vegetable oil,i used melted butter. Other than these 2 minor adjustments,i followed all the instructions to a T, even the 1 cup of boiling water. Baked batter in a pyrex pan for about 40-45 mins. No frosting needed at all. The cake was so \"yummylicious\" as it was.","Yummmmmm! I used new Hersey's Special Dark Chocolate cocoa powder because I didn't have time to get any good cocoa powder (I plan on ordering some from King Arthur Flour to try in this recipe) and it was good! But I can imagine that the cocoa powder makes all the difference in this recipe!! So don't skimp!! Get the good stuff!<br\/>I added a tablespoon or so of instant espresso to the water to give it a bit of depth- next time I might even add more. And I used Chocolate Buttercream Frosting  from Mimi in Maine- which I also added some espresso to.<br\/>This one is a keeper! Thanks!","I have made this recipe about 5 or 6 times now - all with perfect results!   Thank you for this yummy cake recipe! <br\/><br\/>Salt Lake City","Omygoodness!!! This is ABSOLUTELY Delicious!<br\/>I am so bad at making cakes, I've tried so many on this website and thought, why not make another one and see how bad it comes out, but NO! this recipie is so easy, so simple and Mygosh the cake is so MOIST and delicious, I am already planning on making another one, the one I baked yesterday is already finished.]<br\/><br\/>Thank you so much for sharing such a great recipie, highly appreciated!","Stunning cake!!  Incredibly moist and delicious - super easy!! I halved the recipe and made two 6-inch layers for my husband's birthday cake.  I topped with a light coconut buttercream and toasted coconut.  Thank you so much for posting!! Hands down, the best chocolate cake I've ever had!","Great recipe! Made a couple tiny changes; used weak coffee instead of the boiling water and baked this in 3 8 inch pans due to me not having 9 inch ones. I baked for 25 minutes and the cake was PERFECT! My son is in heaven over his triple decker birthday cake and has stated that this is The Cake Recipe for his birthday from now on. Thank you very much for sharing!","Haven't tasted it yet, but both layers fell while cooking. Made recipe as directed. Not sure, maybe this has to do something with our altitude. I am mile high. Bummer. I am sure it will taste good though and I am sure I can find a way to hide these sad little guys.","Awesome cake!! I have used this recipe over a dozen times now, to make cakes for family and friends%u2026I also use this recipe for cupcakes, because it is so moist and chocolatey. I use 3\/4 C of water each time rather the the whole cup, have never had problems! Thanks loads for the recipe Marg, it is part of my permanent recipe book now :)","I have to say that I'm in the minority too.  My cake fell while baking and the batter was super runny.  Then when taking it out of my pans it stuck horribly.  So I tasted part of what was left in the pan and it just tastes like sugar.  No chocolate flavor at all.  This was my first attempt at a chocolate cake from scratch and I guess I'll be heading to the store to get a box mix because I don't have time to give another recipe a go.  Bummer...  I had high hopes given all the good reviews.","This is absolutely an excellent recipe. I will never, ever buy a box cake again. Easy and has a wonderful taste. I made cupcakes, everybody LOVED them. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.","This has got to be the best chocolate cake I've ever had! It made great cupcakes. Very moist! And, it was so simple.","Excellent!","This cake is so easy and delicious! I frosted it with cream cheese frosting, I will definetely be making this again and again!","Very easy but delicious cake.  I made half a recipe using a 9X9 inch pan.  Turned out great but may have over baked it a bit.  Baked for 35 min.  I did use the choc. buttercream for the frosting which was also great.  Made for a very rich birthday cake.  Want to try it with coffee next time.","Don't mess with perfection!  When mine was done and it was perfect I decided to make a chocolate sauce; poked holes in both layers and drizzled the sauce over it before adding frosting to make it extra moist and chocolatey!!!! yummy!!!!!!","This cake tastes better the next day. I used buttermilk for milk because that is all I had. The cake is moist and the crumb is tender.","I love this cake. I mix it with coffe and use just over 2\/3 cup of water.I hope it will be a hit at my Debate tournament.","Perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly (including the note about the boiling water), and it turned out wonderfully.  Everyone complimented it.  My husband, who is more partial to lemon cakes, said it was the best cake he's ever had.  I've already decided that this will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!","I used 3\/4 cup of water and it seemed just fine. My husband loved it! It's a Keeper!","Delicious cake recipe!  And the note about the batter being runny is not a joke.  I made it into cupcakes and baked them for 18 minutes.  Paired it w\/ Recipe #111131.","I've made this cake four times now and even when I forgot to put in the one cup of milk last time it still came out perfect. Go figure! I've also adapted this with my own flare and made a chocolate mint cake and served it with a mint cream cheese icing and it was wonderful. If you do make a mint chocolate cake you should add one teaspoon vanilla and one of pure peppermint extract. :)","I've been making this recipe for decades (I got it from the back of a Hershey's cocoa container), and every time I make a different chocolate cake recipe, I always wish I had made this one instead. The best tip is *not* to use the full amount of boiling water - it tastes EVEN BETTER with somewhat less water! I've tried it with coffee, less oil, double-sifted cake flour ... so many ways to vary it up and still have a fantastic chocolate cake!","FANTASTIC! i can't keep this in the house, the moment it comes out of the oven i have swarms of people flocking to get some :) i can honestly say this is the best cake i have ever ever had!","A good, moist chocolate cake. Not so sweet. Not stunning, but good.","This is my go-to recipe when there's a birthday or event coming up where a cake is needed. I always get SO many compliments on the cake!! Not only is it so easy to make, it just tastes delicious! Especially the way its so gooey in the middle. Thank you so much for this recipe!!","OMG, this was amazing!  I made it exactly as written & it is delicious!  Will be making this again!","Excellent recipe as the numerous ratings show.  I added a pinch of ground red pepper and used 2\/3 of a cup of hot coffee instead of water.    I baked them in tiny silicone muffin cups topping them with a dollop of Decorator Buttercream Icing.  They took only 15 minutes to bake and were a wonderful bite sized treat!","i just made this cake today and it is sooooo good! I quartered this (which would call for 1\/2 an egg, but i used the whole) since i am dieting and dont want a whole cake sitting around that tastes this good! lol<br\/><br\/>I served it plain with just a little powdered sugar. It did fall a little, but that just made for an almost gooey center that was so good!<br\/><br\/>update: Its been over a year but i finally made this cake again (nothing against it i just rarely make cake). And it is delicious as it was last time, slightly less moist so it didnt fall (it did stick but i blame my self for not preping my pan correctly). Again i skipped frosting opting for powdered sugar, and an adorable heart and \"Be Mine\" stencil for Valentine's Day! (oh i cut it in half and used just under 1\/2c of coffee instead of water)","Awesome Chocolate Cake recipe, was a huge success and hit. In place of the Boiling Water, I used a 1\/2 Cup of Mocha Nut Espresso, it is a nice compliment to the chocolate in this recipe and adds to the depth of flavor. Super easy, and will be my \"go to\" for chocolate cake\". Thank You Marg","I baked this for my husband's 55th birthday.  I made it exactly as stated adding almost the entire cup of water and baking it for 32 minutes.  I hate to say this but it came out dry and my husband and I were both disapointed as it has so many good reviews.  I would give it less stars but possibly it could be my oven as I already know that my oven doesn't bake up evenly.  Although only a couple of weeks prior to baking this cake, I had made some cupcakes from a box as I was expecting company with children and those came out nice and moist and my husband actually liked the cupcakes better than the cake made from scratch.  Maybe I should have taken the cake out a little sooner, I don't know.  Sorry :(","Fantastic!  I thought I would be sweet and bake a chocolate cake for my husband for Valentine's Day.  The first one I made was awful (not this recipe, but a different one).  So there I was back in the kitchen for my next attempt and this receipe didn't let me down.  My husband took one bite and said now this is a cake.  It was so moist and I don't think I will ever make another chocolate cake again.  Thanks for a tried and true recipe. :)","A very easy to follow recipe, popular with the family, has become my go-to chocolate cake.","I actually shrunk the recipe for 5 people so that I wouldn't waste any cake if the recipe didn't turn out well..but it took me by surprise! It was one of the best chocolate cakes Ive made. Ive swapped flour for spelt flour.. and also used carotino oil instead of usual vegetable oil..used Low GI sugar instead of caster sugar. Turned out so well even without frosting. I was surprised by how thin the mixture was before you bake it.. but it was fine!","NO FAIL and ALWAYS delicious! I use soy milk, cut the sugar a bit and use just over a half cup of boiling water. I have also made cupcakes and baked for about 20 minutes. They rose and were moist and didn't stick to the paper. My go-to cake recipe. I use Kittencal's Chocolate Icing to frost. I will never go back to boxed!","This cake turned out amazing.I added chocolate frosting to the top of the cake after it was done.I will definitely try this recipe again !:)","Wow! This cake is phenomenal. I used instant espresso in place of the water, and baked it in 2 9\" rounds for my mother in law's birthday cake.<br\/>We used the mocha butter cream frosting recipe from the Joy of Cooking, and it was the perfect compliment. The outside we decorated with slivered almonds and chocolate covered espresso beans. <br\/>Everyone at the party RAVED about the cake. I will definitely be making this one again.","indeed a very splendid chocolate cake ! Yummy!","I don't know how I managed to forget rating this recipe (Like you need another 5 star rating ;)) I made this recipe into cupcakes for my dear friend's baby shower. This is easily the moistest (is that even a word) most delicious chocolate cake I've ever had in my LIFE! And I've eatten a lot of chocolate cake. It really doesn't take that much longer than a box mix and for the difference in taste and texture it's so worth it! I'll be making this for a cooking contest tomorrow in a 13x9 and I just know it will give me good scores! ;)","Yum, so tasty!  I used Gluten Free flour blend (2:1 rice flour to tapioca starch   xanthan gum) and it still turned out good.  The cakes did fall in the middle a bit, so next time I would probably use just a smidge less water.","I've never baked a cake before and I did not have any vanilla but it was still excellent! I shared the cake with my friends and they loved it! I am so inspired I will bake some more. :)","made this last night..very moist and chocolately!! the last 3-4 min of baking, i threw on top a handfull of choc chips and chopped walnuts","We had a big family party and I chose this recipe as one of the many desserts we served.  This cake blew them away!  Everyone loved it.  I'll be keeping this one to make again and again.","I have been searching for a recipe like this.  This cake was great and everyone loved it.  I can't wait to make it again.","I wasn't sure about this cake after it baked up. I followed the recipe exactly but had to undercook by nearly 10 minutes when it was ready, and it just seemed... different.  It was incredibly difficult to get out the pan as well and seemed very crumby.  I had to freeze it solid to get it frostable so it would fall apart in crumbles when I frosted it.  I was quite nervous because I made it for a large group for a good friend's birthday party, but figured they would at least appreciate the attempt.  Anyway, I frosted it with Kittencal's Chocolate Frosting recipe and everyone ate in silence because it was THAT good.  Incredibly moist and chocolately without being too sweet (though I did eliminate just a bit of sugar).  I cannot emphasize how delicious this cake was with the buttercream frosting.  WOW.  Everyone asked for the recipe and I was recruited to make the identical cake for another friend's cake a few weeks from now.  There was not a single piece left.  YUMMY!","I made several cakes from this recipe and froze them. One was eaten a week after freezing and the other was eaten 2 months after freezing. Both were simply delicious!!! Thank you for this recipe. It is a keeper.","In a word, \"Delicious!!!\"  This cake is more rich and chocolatey than anything I've had out of a box.  Definitely worth the extra effort to gather up and measure out all the necessary ingredients.","This cake was theee best! It's moist and rich!! It's exactly what a chocolate cake should be- I used buttermilk (vinegar and milk) instead of milk and hot coffee instead of hot water. .... I will use this recipe over and over. Thanks!","Decent, bare bones chocolate sponge. Tastier than a mix and quicker than a more sophisticated recipe. I suspect children, people who grew up with fond memories of sponge from a box or view cake as simply a frosting delivery device will like this. I used boiling hot espresso and added a bit of creme de cacao to deepen the chocolate flavor. I won't make this for anyone I'm trying to impress, but for kids and the easily pleased, this is speedy and virtually foolproof.","Tried this for my chocolate loving husband's birthday.  BIG HIT.  Easy to make.  Will definitely make it again.  The hints and notes from others helped.  I did add instant coffee to the water for an added boost.","Completely upset with this recipe.  I haven't even had a chance to taste it, but (despite using the recommended size!!!)  my batter overflowed 10 minutes into the baking process.<br\/>How in the world was this not corrected on the original recipe?<br\/><br\/>Advice:  forget the 2\/3 full advice.  If it is over halfway, it will go over!<br\/>Delicious burnt cake smell for days. Enjoy!","OMG delicious!!!! I took some suggestions from other reviews.  Normally I do it with butter but this time I decided to go for the veg oil. LOVE IT!!!","Moist, delicious, and simple! I used the dark chocolate like the recipe recommends and the family is in love! I'm going to try next time with seven minute icing!","Made it three times in three days and the family still wants more. Awesome recipe . Thanks for sharing !","Wow - just served this for Xmas Eve dinner and it was a HUGE hit! I was a little worried about (the handful) of bad reviews - but I can confirm that a) this cooked beautifully in two 9 inch pans in exactly 30 mins and b) came out of the pans easily and in one piece, c) didn't sink after cooling, d) didn't overflow while cooking and e) was totally delicious!<br\/><br\/>I used just over 2\/3 cup of boiling water (didn't try subbing coffee instead) and in fact followed the recipe exactly, to the letter. The cake came out really light, moist and the perfect sweetness.<br\/><br\/>We used Kittencal's chocolate frosting between the two layers and all over the cake - and that was amazing too.<br\/><br\/>Last but not least, we ran a vegetable peeler down the long edge of a milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate bar to cover the top with tri-colored chocolate curls - and voila! Better than any chocolate cake that I've ever had from a bakery, restaurant . . . or anywhere!! Seriously!! Would give this six stars if I could!!","very nice, easy to make and tasty, very moist. It had a bit of an oil taste to it which was the only thing I didn't really love, so next time I will try it with melted butter instead.","This was my first ever cake. It's delicioussssss. I think the best cake i've ever had with the right amount of moisture. I'm Miss Chef at home now :D","I did add an extra 1\/4 cup of cocoa but other than that I followed the directions. The end result was a luscious & chocolaty cake that paired perfectly with http:\/\/www.spectrumorganics.com\/shared\/recipe.php?rid=108 .","Fabulous cake!Made it for my hubby&#039;s birthday and he loved it. I got complimented on how well it tasted and I can say that this is the chocolate cake I will be making from now on. I did add coffee to it instead of just boiling water as some reviewers mentioned this gave it an extra kick. I believe it worked.Thanks.","Whoa! I used this recipe for my first attempt at making chocolate cake from scratch, and, I kid you not, my results were as good or better than a professional bakery's?!?!?! My husband and I have gotten chocolate cake and cupcakes many times from lots of bakeries over the years, so to have something come out of my oven that I whipped up on a whim one afternoon is incredible.<br\/><br\/>As suggested by other reviewers, I used only 2\/3 cup boiling water and mixed in 1 tsp of espresso powder for the coffee flavor. The batter was thinner than I'm used to seeing with boxed cake mixes but it baked up fantastic!<br\/><br\/>I made cupcakes and my total baking time was about 25 minutes -- however, I did overfill the liners so the 20 minute estimates from other reviewers might be closer to the mark when I next make these.<br\/><br\/>They tasted kind of bland when they first came out of the oven, even with icing smeared on it (I couldn't wait.) However, once they cooled for 2 hours or so and I piped straight all-butter buttercream they tasted better. Then once they had a chance to sit overnight in a container and the icing crusted up just a bit? OMG, PERFECTION. Richly chocolatey but not overwhelming, not too sweet so biting into it with icing doesn't make you feel instantly toothachey, and the density and crumb are just right.<br\/><br\/>Seriously just blown away how this recipe is professional, bakery quality. And not much harder than a box of cake mix, just requires a few more measuring cups and spoons. Total keeper!","Cake was delicious and moist.  I substituted coffee for the cup of water and it was great.  Family members loved cake. I've made it twice and it is gone within an hour.  I must admit the batter was thin just as you said but it made. I was afraid it wouldn't bake but boy when it was all said and done it was fantastic.  This is my go to cake now.  Thanks for sharing.","This was my first homemade chocolate cake! It came out perfect although I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2!....GREAT RECIPE!","My family made this cake with Kittencal's chocolate frosting for me as a Valentine's day gift and it was AMAZING! It rivals a very popular local restaurant's chocolate cake and I highly recommend that you try this recipe. My family used a 13 x 9 pan and there was a very slight fall in the middle of the cake.","love this cake!!","The perfect classic chocolate cake!  It is so tasty, moist and not overly sweet.  I made it for my dad's birthday party and all the guests loved it.  Perhaps this is the best of this type of cake that I've ever tried.","The moistest cake we have ever had. Sinking was not a problem, but frosting such a gentle cake was. Anyhow, I've never been foot at it and the taste was all that mattered to me and everyone else eating. Followed the recipe to the letter, using boiling water at a level halfway between 2\/3 and 1 cup. (5\/6? Lol). Will try espresso substitution next time. And adding cream of tartar, too.","My new favorite chocolate cake!!!  This was a hit for the party where the birthday boy requested chocolate cake.  Very moist.  I used Penzey's Dutch processed cocoa and it was so yummy.  As a strict believer that you follow every recipe as written the first time you make it, I admit, I cheated.  When I had my cup of boiling water ready to pour into my batter, I grabbed the bottle of instant coffee and stirred a tablespoon or so into it.  YUM!  I will always make this cake w\/ coffee instead of water now.  To die for.  Now, to find the perfect frosting....","I had a recipe much like this in my &quot;wheat days&quot;.  I altered it only with my gluten free flour and followed the recipe as written.  A great gluten free cake.  Came out perfect.  The hard part was waiting for it to cool so I could frost it and then eat a slice.  Great chocolate flavor.  And certainly no harder than a box mix to make and soooooo much better taste and texture.","This is the recipe on the back of the Hersheys Special Dark Cocoa container.  It turns out fantastic.  Keeps great covered on your counter for days (retains moistness) so you can eat it at every meal.  Trust me, you&#039;ll want to!  The cocoa container also has a frosting recipe that turns out great.  I like to make the cake with dark cocoa and the frosting with regular cocoa.  Even my fiance who never craves cake, much less chocolate, will keep on eating this!","This cake so moist, semi sweet, tender and chocolate best... My hubby who doesn&#039;t really like chocolate, become one of this cake fan, either my 20months daughter.. thank you","My daughter used this recipe to make cupcakes for my son&#039;s graduation party.  The texture and flavor were perfect.  She frosted them with chocolate ganache.  So good!","Moist and delicious! The best chocolate cake ever!","This is a great chocolate cake - very light yet moist.  Took this to work for a co-workers birthday frosted with peanut butter frosting - it was gone in no-time.  My new go-to chocolate cake.  Easily converted to gluten free using my favorite gluten free flour. I also added 2 T of ground flax seed and used buttermilk instead of milk as is my standard practice for converting recipes.  Thanks for posting this Marg.","I forgot the hot water and it was still so moist!!! This cake is the best chocolate cake recipe ive come across!!!! Dark, moist and holds a cupcake well.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt; I usually fill cc 2\/3rds but read somewhere that it would fall a bit, so i filled 3\/4 not doing that again.","Just wanted to let everyone know, I have made this recipe many times and it&#039;s EXCELLENT and  so so easy.  I just made it and forgot the oil all together.  FYI---- it was still absolutely tasty.  I could tell it wasn&#039;t quite as moist, but for those who want to cut the fat a little......it was still good!!!","I have made this cake for years.  The recipe is actually on the Hershey&#039;s can... Hershey&#039;s Deep Dark Chocolate Cake... Its always been my go to chocolate cake.","I found the flavor very good, but I made cupcakes with paper wrappers and they would not peel off. If I make this again I&#039;m making sure to use a non-stick metal pan only.","Okay- This was absolutely amazing!  I made it for my sons birthday two weeks ago and now am making it for my daughter&#039;s birthday because she requested it.  I was tempted to substitute coffee for the water- but it was SO good just as the recipe was written that I did not.  I used the new Hershey&#039;s special dark cocoa- Truly the best chocolate cake recipe out there in my opinion!  5 stars +  Thanks Marg!","Husband followed recipe to a tee, except we didn&#039;t have vegetable oil on hand. We used pureed pumpkin instead. Turned out deliciously moist, but with good firm structure. Thank you for a simple and tasty recipe!","This cake is sooooo good! I&#039;ve made it several times now and it&#039;s always perfect.","This is the best chocolate cake recipe ever.  I made cupcakes and froze them.  The came out of the freezer just as tasty and moist as the went in. (of course I tasted them first)  No other chocolate cake recipe for me from now on.","This is the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made!! It was moist and easy to make. I was a bit thrown off with adding the water to the recipe but it turned out GREAT!!! I baked it for Christmas and I have a household of chocolate lovers. Will be adding to my permanent recipe box.","Made a double batch, thinking I&#039;d need it to make the giant cupcake cake I planned for my daughter&#039;s birthday (which required 6 cups of batter). Well, no need to double - I ended up with the giant cupcake, a dozen regular sized cupcakes, two dozen mini cupcakes, and a 8x8 square cake. Doesn&#039;t bother me a bit - never enough chocolate cake! I made it with Ruddy Red Cocoa which is 24% fat as opposed to regular cocoa (12%). Fabulous. Very moist. TIP: Fill only 2\/3 of the way in your baking pan, whatever shape you choose - it rises beautifully. I filled my large cupcakes too high and they overflowed the cups and sank in the middle. My fault. I added Raspberry Jam Buttercream for a fabulously decadent dessert! http:\/\/www.food.com\/recipe\/raspberry-jam-buttercream-426448","loved it","Cake turned out good!","I would give you 10 stars if I could.  The first time I made this cake I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. The second time I made it somehow I looked at the recipe wrong and added 1 and 3\/4 cups boiling water.  It REALLY  looked thin (LOL). Since I had done everything but bake it, I went ahead and put it in the oven.  Unbelievable but it was as good as the first.  Oh, and did I mention I did it both times with gluten free flour blends.  This cake is awesome!! Easy, delicious, and foolproof.  My non gluten free friends love it as well.","It turned out amazing thank you for the recipe","Worked perfectly by following the recipe exactly as is (one of the easiest recipes too). Made two 9-inch round pans and baked at 350F for 30 min. Used between 2\/3 and 3\/4 of boiling water as suggested. I haven&#039;t tasted it yet but it smells like rich, dark chocolate and it looks very light and moist, not crumbly. I am sure it will taste good!","Won&#039;t lie, i&#039;m rating it because this is my shortcut to getting back to amazing recipes. WOW","This cake is simple and delicious.  Marg&#039;s tip about decreasing the boiling water was very helpful.  The recipe is the same as the one on the back of the Hershey&#039;s cocoa tin, but I really rely on all of the reviews, comments, and tips from everyone!","Wonderful! Used the 3\/4 boiling water as recommended and it was perfect. Hubby wanted chocolate cake for his birthday and I&#039;m anti box mixes. Slathered this in Kittencal&#039;s dark chocolate butter cream frosting off this site. Rich dark chocolate perfection. Thanks for sharing. My husband thanks you as well!","Maybe I&#039;m missing something, but this cake was meh at best. It completely sunk in the middle; the flavor was nothing exciting, and the texture was just ok. I made sure to use high quality dutch cocoa and felt like it was a waste of ingredients. &lt;br\/&gt;A box mix of brownies would have been the same for me.","Was simply delicious.......best chocolate cake ever......loved it...","I used whole wheat organic flower and the cake had an awful taste and the dough stuck to the pan. It also didn&#039;t rise much.  I couldn&#039;t get  the end product out of the pan, it just crumbled and broke apart.   Maybe it was the flour I used.  I will use plain white unbleached flour next time to see if I get different results.","My first review mentioned I used the frosting recipe too, lol. There is no frosting recipe here. Now I don&#039;t remember where I got the frosting recipe from! Either way, this cake was AMAZING!!!!!!!!","This is an excellent quick and easy chocolate cake.  I toned down the sugar slightly to balance out the creamy sweet cream cheese frosting.  The cake came out perfect the first time.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Now village and city folk from Yunnan, China are enjoying your cake as well.","Hi this looks so amazing...but I wanted to know..as you have varied between 2\/3 and 1  cup for the hot water can you give me a little more help...as in what consistency should I be looking for before adding less or more water. Thanks can&#039;t wait to try it!","My first &quot;not from a box&quot; cake!  I made it for my husband&#039;s birthday with peanut butter icing.  It was fabulous!  I am ready for cupcake wars!  Ok, perhaps not yet but this recipe will stay with me forever.   It turned out beautifully and tasted even better.","Just tried this recipe with not much hope as past ones have been pale in colour and taste, but this one OMG Fantastic just perfect in colour and taste, I used green and blacks cocoa powder as that was the closest I could find, a big thank you for sharing this recipe I love it ?","My son wanted chocolate cake for his fifth birthday and this is the one I chose to make.  It was easy to make into cupcakes and tasted great. Thank you!","With the slightest of variations, turned ot into a great gluten-free cake just by substituting an equal volume of g-f all-purpose flour and a mere &frac12; tsp of xanthan gum. I thought I got a hint of bean-flour when trying a tiny bit on a finger, so added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract. My family loved it; they went through the entire 9x13 cake in one day. Since my son &#039;hates&#039; cake generally, and I&#039;m the only one who must eat gluten free, this is quite the accomplishment. It&#039;s my first (and only, so far) g-f cake that was as good as those I used to make with regular (wheat) flour.","Amazing, delicious, and super moist! Wonderful cake. My family loved it.","My cakes fell in the center too but it&#039;s not my first rodeo so it was not an issue, just level with more frosting Yumm. Taste wise I could sit and eat this cake &quot;as is&quot; because it&#039;s flavor is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. I took the advice of another reviewer and used coffee instead of H2O. This is my new go to recipe!!","I can&#039;t wait to make this delicious chocolate cake! check my favorite recipes for healthy desserts here :&nbsp;http:\/\/trk.as\/TOP10","Obviously this doesn&#039;t need another great review, but what the heck...\n\nMade this for my daughters birthday and everyone loved it! I made two batches, one with water and one with coffee, they were both awesome, but will use coffee from now on. \n\nDefinitely putting this one in the recipe box!","Totally yummy and moist.  Used coffee in place of water for that richness.   I am very fussy about cakes.  Once I actually made three cakes in one day for a birthday.  This recipe is a definite winner.  Thank you for sharing.","A lovely rich, moist chocolate cake. I was surprised how easy this was to make and it was certainly decadent! I made 2 9 inch layers and then topped it with chocolate buttercream. This might be my new favourite chocolate cake recipe as it is perfectly soft and delicious!","very rich,  was a big hit with the family","Best chocolate cake recipe ever !","Perfection describes this cake. I've been searching for the perfect chocolate cake over the years and this one became my all time favorite. The rich chocolatey flavor and moist texture makes it an awesome option for all occasions! Ps. I exchanged the 3\/4 cup of hot water for 2\/4 cup of hot strong coffee + 1\/4 cup of hot water to enhanced all flavors and it turned out great!","Halved this recipe, subbed in almond milk, and used half coffee and half water as per other reviewers recommendation. The batter was SUPER thin and adding in boiling water to mix with raw egg in it freaked me out- it went fine, just be sure to go slow! haha! Used a bundt pan as well. Came out of the oven all pretty, glossy, and dark. I let it cool and went to flip it-----NOPE this thing was stuck in there- a pammed out pan. WAY too moist and light for a bundt- my own fault really. BUT WHATEVER I just tried a piece and it was delicious! The texture is excellent, the flavor could be more chocolatey but not a huge deal (even with dutch cocoa). As others said this cake is really sweet- reduce the sugar some and you'll be good and it should help the chocolate flavor pop out more. Overall I would recommend this cake and will make it again.","Wow, I used this recipe to make cupcakes, and they turned out so tasty, soft and moist. I used kittencal's chocolate frosting recipe for the frosting. Perfect! Everyone loved them.","Can't believe I haven't reviewed this before now. This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I've made it several times with &quot;normal&quot; cocoa powder, but today made it with the Special Dark that is recommended. Really a lovely cake. Turned out almost black and I was afraid I'd overcooked it, but no. It was perfect! Topped it with Kittencal's Chocolate Frosting (#89207), also made with Special Dark. Used the lowest amount of cocoa in the frosting and it was a delicious compliment to the cake. Used a cake pan that creates cavities to put goodies inside each piece and filled the cavities with fluffy chocolate and vanilla (alternating) pastry creams. The dark chocolate goodness contrasted with the fluffy light pastry cream was heaven! Just FYI - As the author states, the batter is *very* runny - pretty much liquid. It's weird and seems wrong, but just go with it. Bakes up wonderfully!","I love this cake! I use 3\/4 cup of coffee in mine. This time I did the recipe as a Bundy cake, baked 40 minutes and used bakers joy with flour on the pan. The cake came out perfect. As soon as it cools it will get a chocolate ganache glaze.","This cake is dense, moist, and decadent! I used a dark chocolate icing recipe for the topping and mounds of strawberries;)) My daughter LOVED her birthday cake!!","This is a WONDERFUL recipe! I always get rave reviews on it! Moist and very chocolatey! My son always requests this cake and I make the Chocolate Buttercream Recipe by Mimi (many times medium to dark chocolate frosting). I suggest using a really good cocoa - I usually use Rodelle from Costco (They only have it Holidays so I stock up! I learned my lesson when I ran out.) The Special Dark by Hershey is also a good choice.","I used only 1.5 cups of sugar, 2\/3 cup of water, and I used black cocoa powder. Cake came out very moist. Perfect amount of batter for both my cake tins, which are 8&quot;. Recipe says you shouldn't bake in an 8&quot; but it worked fine for me.","Ok. I was hasty. This is actually pretty yummy. Great with a big ol glob of whipped cream and berries. Tender and light after cooled a bit.","This was the best chocolate cake I EVER ate!! So moist and great flavor. Everyone LOVED it. I made fresh whipped cream frosting. It was a hit!","Use more water!! I used just under a full cup of boiling water and only cooked it for 30 minutes but it came out so dry and undercooked","This is so easy to make and honestly the most moist chocolate cake I\u2019ve ever made! It will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on! I did need to cook a few minutes longer than recipe said, but that could have just been my oven. Cook till toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean or nearly clean..","&quot;Would you please make your yummy chocolate cake?&quot; I always explain that it isn't mine, but thanks for &quot;my chocolate&quot; cake that works every time.

I made it for the first time yesterday and it is almost gone.  I will definitly make it again.","This is just too easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, sadly leaving out the nuts for a few finicky eaters around here.  The buttery flavor was really pronounced and the bottom \"layer\" was similar to a pumpkin custard.  I'm thinking this might need to be the dessert for holiday dinners.  Excellent recipe that we'll make again!  Thanks.","I made this with no changes, very easy to make and I had all the ingredients in my pantry. Excellent! As soon as I tasted this I knew I had found a new family favorite recipe. I shared with a couple of my neighbors and they asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!","This is a lovely dessert.  Simple yet very rich.  I thought that the crunch layer was a little to thick as compared to the pumpkin layer.  I think I will use less cake mix and half of the butter next time.  ","I will never make pumpkin pie again!!! It just can not compete with the taste of this. I do agree with Sisty Gin in the fact that 1\/2 to 3\/4 of the cake mix  would be sufficent. Just a thought; to use the remaining portion of cake mix, use apple filling or cherry pie filling in a 9x9, pour remaining cake mix over the filling, drizzle with butter and bake. Two desserts in the place of one..... yummy.","We LOVED this recipe.  It will be served on Thanksgiving here from now on.  I gave it a test run last week.  Its SOOOOOOO good. ","Wonderful!!!  I took this to a church potluck and it was all gone in no time! DH also loves this one.  I will definately make this again.","Finally a GREAT pumpkin Thanksgiving dessert for us non pie making people!  It has been officialy entered into our traditional Thanksgiving menu.  I only put pecans on one half becuase my DS hates nuts, but he liked it so much that on his THIRD helping, he ate the nuts too! ","Marg.....wow this was teriffic.  Instead of evap. milk, I used fat free half and half, used frozen (I froze it) pumpkin and also used splenda instead of sugar.  Got rave reviews at our family get-to-gether","This is an excellent dessert.  We had is for Thanksgiving  (Canadian) It was such a treat,I don't care for nuts but they are so good with this....I used Andeabell's suggestion to use less cake mix.  I used about one half of cake mix and it turned out well.

Wonderful!!!Exactly the same.Thank you for posting.","This is wonderful! Even my DH, who's not a big fan of pumpkin pie, loved it! Thanks for a keeper, Marg!","This is my new pumpkin dessert.  The taste is great. Creamy pumpkin and crunchy topping.  I used skim evaporated milk, Splenda instead of sugar, omitted the salt and used 1\/4 c of butter.  DH thanks you too!","I loved this recipe....too much I am afraid...I could have eaten the whole pan.  So I took it to work where it was gone in no time.  Numerous requests for recipes.  Thanks!","Marg, I could have easily eaten the whole pan of this.  I made the mistake of trying a small (I mean small) taste so I could give a honest review, and I have to admit I ate another small bite.  And OH, I forgot to say I don't normally care for pumpking pie.  I can see me using this many times to come.","Wow.... What a keeper. The creamy pumpkin layer mixed with the crunchy toppping was delightful. I served this yummy delight to friends last evening. Everyone loved it. I'm thinking if trying butternut squash from my garden next time. Thanks for sharing another keeper. Maryanne","Delicious. I forgot to buy the pecans, but other than that - followed the recipe exactly. Next time I won't forget the pecans!","This was a favorite at our 60-person family Halloween party.  Everyone loved it!  I made three pans, and they were all gone!  It was very simple!","Holee Molee!  This recipe is da bomb!  I doubled everything except the topping.  Only used 1\/2 the cake mix.  Didn't have any punkin pie spice, so I made some using recipe #37298.  How handy is that?  This was very good, Marg.  And you did say it was calorie-free, right?!  ;-)","Yummy! A great new way to serve a classic!","Really yummy!  I used half the amount of cake mix and butter.","This was absolutely wonderful!!!","Because health conscious about food additives, I am not usually a fan of recipes using prepared mixes. HOWEVER,when I ran across this recipe and the rave reviews I HAD to try it.  WOW. It is sensational.  I used half the amount of cake mix and butter, but may try it full force next time because there WILL be a next time, and a next. Thanks Marg for a quick, delicious dessert recipe with lots of Vitamin A!","We started making this about a year ago and it was an instant hit for us. Incredibly simple to make, and a perfect holiday (or average tuesday night) dessert. We cook as-is, but skip the whipped topping.","This was great!  I made it this afternoon in an effort to give the kids a slightly healthier dessert.  I used splenda in place of the sugar (1\/2 c splenda, 1\/2 c splenda brown sugar, ommitted the pecans because I was out of them, and used 1\/3 box cake mix and 1 stick of butter.  I sprinkled the cake mix over the top, then used a frozen stick of butter and a vegetable peeler to peel thin curls of butter off the frozen stick, then laid them on top.  Turned out perfectly!  The kids and I loved it.  Thanks so much for posting!","My sister brought this for Thanksgiving last night....  MMM..  Thanks Marg for a fabulous recipe!","This is fantastic!  I think next time I will use less butter but it was still delicious.  We topped it with butter pecan ice cream even though it didn't need anything else.  Thanks Marg!","Everyone loves this dessert with the buttery, crunchy topping.  After making it a couple times, I decided to lower the fat and calories because we want to enjoy this dessert frequently.  So I used HALF a cake mix and HALF the butter, and the result was still outstanding - and there was plenty of the topping, as you can see in my photo.","This is really delicious and easy to make.  Thank you for the recipe.","Really yummy!! My family is totally addicted to this, and it is easier then making pumpkin pie...woohooo!! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, we will be using it often.","wonderful and easy to make, Made it yesterday and will be making it more and more. Thank you!","This was really good and easy to make. I only used 2 eggs (I misread the recipe) but it worked out fine. I didn't add pecans as my kids don't like them. Next time I would only use half of the cake mix and butter on top as I thought it had too much topping. Other then that we thought it was perfect!","This recipe is a keeper at my house. This recipe is very easy to follow and prepare. Everyone enjoyed it very much. Thanks so much for sharing.","This was a huge hit!!!  Replacing pumpkin pies forever in our house.  I doubled the filling and just used one box of cake and almost all of the butter.","I dislike plain old pumpkin pie, and this was a hit. I used chopped hazelnuts instead of pecans, and it was very good. Next time I will double the filling to make it thicker. This has replaced pumpkin pie at my house!","This was a hit with the family!  We used about half the butter and it was still awesome.","I made this for our Thanksgiving dessert and it was great. It is now a family favorite. After reading all the other reviews I did decide to use a 1\/2 cup of butter and I used 1 small box of Jiffy yellow cake mix. It worked out well and had the perfect texture. Thanks for sharing and I am glad that others have shared such great reviews and tips also.","This recipe is excellent!!! I new family tradition, I believe. Thanks for sharing. Several people asked me for the recipe.","Fantastic flavor and so easy to make! I will be making this again real soon the first went so fast! I used a 15 oz can of Libby's (just add an egg and evaporated milk type) and just noticed I never added the 1-1\/4 cup of sugar, but you would never know it was sweet and yummy just the same!","That recipe was a big hit. I made 2 because I only used half the cake mix for each pie and half a cup of margarine to put on the top but it did not last long because they loved it. I just made another one but I only put half the sugar because I found it too sweet the first time. Thank you for sharing.","Delicious! Awesome! Couldn't stop eating! This taste GREAT with some vanilla ice cream. I made it just the way it was written. But I think i would use less butter next time. It tasted like pecan & pumkpin pie mixed together.","Rave reviews all around!! I threw this together in no time flat for our Bible study last night, and everyone LOVED it! Even my husband (who is not usually a fan of desserts) had 3 or 4  servings! This was exceptionally good with coffee! This is a recipe I will make many, many more times I am sure!","This is really really good and I will be making it for Thxgiving dinner next week.  I made a trial run yesterday but only using half of the mixure and baking it in an 8 x 8 dish.  I was worried the 50 minutes would be too long but it came out just fine!  I will use less sugar next time as it was pretty sweet....but some people like that!","Amazing! Everyone loved it! Served it warm and it was crumbly but delicious.","It was probably somewhat drier than it should have been coz I over-baked it--oven problem. I subbed Splenda for the sugar but that was the only change I made.\nHowever, this was one of the very best desserts I have ever made.  My husband raved about it.  The only reason I made this was becoz of the great reviews.  An over-the-top recipe has to be labor-intensive, right?? and it could NEVER include a *gasp* cake mix..right?? LOL..so easy and so good.\nTry it and you won't be disappointed.\nThanx Marg,  for a super- simple great delicious recipe! Chef Judi Coleman","This is a wonderful cross between a pumpkin pie & a crumb cake.  So very easy & I know for a fact that you can assemble this & pop it in the freezer.  When you are ready for it, just thaw & bake.  Delish!","This was a wonderful alternative to pumpkin pie. Everyone raved about how good it was and the house smelled heavenly while it was baking. This will be going in my files as a keeper! Thanks!","EVERYONE raved about this dessert! I made it on thanksgiving and it was \"gobbled\" right up. The only change I made was sprinkling cinnamon and sugar lightly on the crust after it had cooled to give it a little more of a kick. I will definitely be making this again, thanks!","I made this Thanksgiving Eve. I followed the advice in the reviews and used about half of the cake mix and 1\/2 cup butter. This turned out great and I will be making this many more times, I'm sure. Thanks, Marg!","This is so good!\r\nPrepared exactly as written, came out perfect.  The pecans are wonderful on top.  This  will become a family favorite.  Thanks for the recipe!","This was fantastic! My daughter asks for it almost every other week. Everyone we had try it liked it better than pumpkin pie.\r\n\r\nThank you Marge","Delicious - I have been looking for a new way to make pumpkin pie and this is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!","I love this recipe. I made this for my 1st time this past Easter and my family ate 2 whole pies.  I did however only use 1\/2 of the butter and 1\/2 of the cake mix and put the ingredients into 2 pie shells. It still tastes GREAT and I will make it many more times.","This was definitely a 5.  What a great recipe.  Made it for a party and it was a great success.  I did cut the butter in half and used half of the cake as suggested by other people.  It was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe, it is one I will keep and make many times.","I cannot believe I forgot to rate this last year!  This is so delicious.  I made this for dessert on Christmas Eve and got rave reviews.  A lot of my guests did not like pumpkin pie or pumpkin.  I am an avid lover and was looking for something to win them over.  This did the trick!  It is not too sweet and is so incredible.  Thank you so much for sharing!","I've made this a few times now.  My father will only eat pumpkin pie for dessert at every holiday until I brought this over and he tried it.  Now he won't eat my pies anymore!!!  This was very good!  I've tired it with 1\/2 the cake mix called for and with the full amount.  My mom with the sweet tooth loved the full amount.  I like it better with a little less, about 2\/3rds.  It just depends on the level of sweetness you prefer.  Great recipe!  Thanks for posting it!","I loved this too, but agree that it could use about half of the cake mix for my family's taste... a wee bit too sweet.  \r\nThanks for sharing. We will definitely make this again.","I'm so sorry, but we didn't care for this.  It was just okay for the first few bites, but then it started tasting way too buttery.  My husband even referred to it as \"that butter stuff.\"","WOW!! I made this for my Thanksgiving desert, and this will be served in place of pumpkin pie from now on.  It helps to reduce the cake mix and butter or margarine by half, so it's not overwhelmingly buttery or sweet, and it leaves more of a pumpkin layer instead of a bar type dessert.","I have to agree with using 1\/2 the cake mix and 1\/2 the butter. This is basically a pumpkin pie \"dump\" cake-- and for dump cakes I also use the 1\/2 box cake mix and 1\/2 cup butter. Really tasty and easy enough for my 9 year old DS to make for his contribution to Thanksgiving.","Wonderful dessert! Nobody in my family, myself included, cares much for nuts in dishes such as these; so I left the pecans out. I have given this recipe out to people every time I have made it for a gathering. My mother even had people calling her for the recipe after she took it somewhere! I'm going to start just bringing copies of it with me! I use half the butter and cake mix called for. Good pumpkin dessert!","Very easy to make, and smells delicious! I haven't cut into it yet though :)","This was a smash hit at my Thanksgiving dinner.  The kids went wild over it.  Topped with whipped cream and enjoyed every bite!","REALLY Yummy!!!!  I made 1\/2 with pecans and 1\/2 without!  Whole family loved it!  I will make it around holidays to take to family events","I've never made a \"dump cake\" before and found it very odd to sprinkle the dry cake mix on top and then stick it into the oven. However, it turned out great! I only used half of the cake mix based upon reviews from others that it was too sweet and I think that was a good call. I also only used maybe only 1\/4 of the butter in the recipe. The full amount seemed insane! Even with the alterations it was great. Everyone loved it and raved about it and the entire pan was gone within an hour.","Where is the button for ten stars?  I absolutely love this dessert and I make it every year.  Smooth pumpkin on the bottom with a crunchy nut topping, and creamy whipped topping.  UMM!  Fantastic recipe!  Thanks!","This was absolutely delicious! I read the reviews and decided it was going to be too sweet for me also, so I did change some of the ingredients. I did it differently than most reviewers. I figured cake mix has the right amount of sugar if you like cake so I cut the sugar added to the pumpkin to 3\/4 cup and used 3\/4 of the cake mix and a little over half the butter. It turned out perfect!!","My family has been making variations of this recipe for years. I use spice cake,  about a cup of sugar, a stick of butter (we prefer rich desserts during the holidays), and walnuts. This is indeed a forgiving recipe, so by all means adjust to your own tastes. It&#039;s very good with a dollop of whipped cream or a little ice cream.","Yay, I found a recipe I have been using and which I get requests to make... so glad I don&#039;t have to input it myself.  Thanks for posting!  : )  \n\nThis is delicious and my extended family prefers it to pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.","Very good! Used the alternate amounts recommend for the butter and sugar, but used 1\/2 of the cake mix, next time I will use the 2\/3&#039;s as recommended.","So good! Used 1\/2 cup butter and 2\/3 of the cake batter. It didn&#039;t come out as thick as I had hoped, so I just layered the pieces on top of each other (looks like a layered pie, crust and nuts on the bottom with crust and nuts in the center) and added whipped cream on top.

The pumpkin is listed right there.","I made this tonight and the house smelled wonderful long before it was ready to eat!  DH and I both were told this week we need more potassium and pumpkin was a good way to get it.  This recipe is a delicious way to get it.  I can't wait to make it again, but maybe as cupcakes with cream cheese icing, yummmmm!!","Great recipe! I didn't follow it exactly (I omitted the walnut pieces because I thought it had enough fat with 1 1\/4 cups of oil!), but it turned out SO well. Loved it, and so did my guests. I'll be making this again.","Wow!  So much fat in this!  But very yummy!  I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts because I didn't have any.  I also used all whole wheat flour instead of half whole wheat and half all purpose.  It was very moist (most likely from all that oil!) and delicious!  Next time I'm going to substitute applesauce for half of the oil and make it a bit less fattening.","Perfection. It called for the perfect combination of spices to pumpkin. The batter was so yummy I almost didn't want to bake it!  <br\/><br\/>Instead of 'either\/or\" on the cloves and allspice, I put 1\/16th teaspoon of each together to make the 1\/8 tsp called for. At the last minute I found that the only cinnamon I had was some cinnamon-sugar hubby had put into my cinnamon jar (argh!), so I had to\"guesstimate\" that about a 1\/4 cup of that would make enough cinnamon. It was after I'd added the sugar so my cake ended up with an extra 1\/4 sugar.

So instead of the powdered milk\/water combo I used 3 Tablespoons of milk and 3 Tablespoons of buttermilk.

I actually used a squash that had been recommended to us at the pumpkin patch as having a better pumpkin flavor then pumpkin.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour.  My muffin tins tend to be a little small, but I got 36 regular sized muffins and 12 mini out of this recipe.  I sent 12 to school with my son for class snack and we enjoyed the rest.  So glad I chose these for the photo swap #4!","Absolutely wonderful!!  These are the perfect taste of Autumn...the lovely pumpkin with the bit of chocolate and just the right touch of cinnamon spice...so very nice!! :)  I cut the batch in half and got a dozen regular sized muffins and 1 giant jumbo muffin cake (for extra Fall time FUN!!:)  I used the mini chips as Marg (CaymanDesigns) had suggested in her recipe#3564 & LOVE the effect!!  I also added a bit of vanilla flavor to heighten the yummy factor (also suggested in the other version of her recipe) - Fantastic...my favorite muffin of the moment!!! - Great recipe - THANKS!!","these were very moist and tasty. i used 1 cup sugar and had maybe a half bag of regular size chips left. they came out delicious and baked 20 muffins. i will keep this recipe.","Wow! So good!  I only used one cup of sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used gluten free flour and added 1.5 teaspoons of xanthum gum to mimic wheat flour. \n\nMy husband and I can't stop eating them!  Makes quite a few so I froze some for later.","These are delicious!  I am definitely keeping this recipe!  I also used 1 1\/2 cups sugar and tasted great","I just made these for my daughter's preschool class.  I'm sure they're going to love them! So good!   This made 72 mini muffins, so plenty for us at home too.  :)\r\nThe recipe was so easy to mix up.  I didn't have any mini chips, so I just chopped up some regular size chips in the food processor.  Worked great!  I'll definitely be making these again.","These were the bomb!!!  So delicious and moist!  We used regular size Ghiradelli Semi Sweet Choc. chips and added 2 tsp of Vanilla it was absolutely delicious!   I hope they will freeze well, like the other review said, otherwise we will be eating them all!","These are wonderful muffins.  I made them for an after school snack today, and the boys loved them.  I used the 1 1\/2 cup sugar and regular sized chocolate chips.  I added a dash or two of cloves and a few runs across the microplane with a fresh nutmeg.  I got 21 regular sized muffins from my silicone muffin pans using a large ice cream scoop.  We will definitely be adding these to the regular rotation!  Thank you so much for these wonderful fall treats.","After making the original recipe, I decided to try the lighter version on my next batch. These turned out just as delicious as the full-fat version, and flew out of my kitchen just as fast. Thanks for the recipe!!!","These are so moist and perfectly muffin shaped!  I took them to a function and got many compliments on them.  People were very surprised they were low fat.  This recipe actually made 32 standard muffins for me.  I used 1 1\/2 C. sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I also added 1 t. vanilla and a 1\/2 t. ground ginger.    I used milk chocolate mini chips, which I really liked but I may try semi sweet next time.  I'll be making these often!","I made them the other day, pretty good although I had made a few changes to the recipe to make it healthier. I used 1 1\/2 cups of pastry whole wheat flour (whole wheat flour will also work)  and 1 1\/2 cups of white flour. I also added 1\/4 cup of flax seeds to add more fiber and healthy omega-3 oils, 60% cacao regular size bitter sweet chocolate chips (to incorporate some healthy properties from the pure cacao) instead of the mini chocolate chips and 1 1\/2  cups of sugar instead of 2, also a pitch of nutmeg goes very well with the flavor of the pumpkin. Enjoy :)","These muffins were good. I made half a batch because I had l cup of pumpkin that I needed to use. The half batch made 48 pretty little mini muffins. Thanks!","YUMMY! I have made these muffins twice in the last week (both were 1\/2 batches). They are so moist and delicious. I made a couple of changes to make it fit my gestational diabetic diet: Splenda and Stevia Plus powder in place of sugar, and all whole wheat flour. Normally I only subs. 1\/2 of the flour with whole wheat, but these were so moist that going all out didn't seem to make a big difference. Amazing- and now my new favorite. :)","Great version of a great recipe. I tweaked even further using 3\/4 c splenda and 1\/2 cup sugar. Nice and light and a winner with even my picky kids! Decreased amountt of chocolate to 6 ounces of chocolate chunks, my kids saw the larger chunks as a treat within a treat!\nWendy","These were okay. One of my sons liked them and the other did not....and I just thought they were okay. Made for a decent afternoon snack, but I don't think I will be making them again in the future.","These turned out good...but not great.  I did try to make them healthier by using half baking splenda and half whole wheat flour and maybe that hurt the flavor.  Would make again, but would use more sugar\/splenda and less salt.  Thanks for a good base for light pumpkin muffins.","These were good and I like the fact that it makes 2 dozen muffins.  I did find the chocolate chips overpowered the pumpkin flavour.  But that is no complaint!!!  Who doesn't like some chocolate in a muffin???  Thanks Marg","I made several modifications.\n\nI used one large can of pumpkin instead of a small one and a cup of applesauce.\n\nI substituted 3\/4 cup Splenda brown sugar blend for the 1 1\/2 cups white sugar.\n\nI used 2 cups white flour and one cup whole wheat instead of 3 cups white flour.\n\nI used a cup of chopped pecans instead of chocolate chips.\n\nI also added some nutmeg, cloves and vanilla in addition to the cinnamon.\n\nI made a dozen large muffins, a pan of \"gems\" (mini muffins), and I scooped out the last six dollops (about 2 tablespoons each) onto a cookie sheet - these became \"pumpkin-pecan scones.\"  People liked 'em!\nThey were all good, but the gem size seemed particularly well suited to this recipe.","These are fabulous. I made them exactly to the recipe and got 29 muffins out of it. My kids loved them. I didn't taste the pumpkin flavor that much but at least I'm getting some nutrition!\r\nYou really can't tell this is a lighter version.","I made this recipe exactly with the exception that I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  My family loved it and no one knew that it was a lighter version.  They were delicious and you could not tell that it contained applesauce.  I will begin substituting applesauce in all my muffin recipes.","This is the BEST muffin recipe ever! I modify it to make it even healthier and the muffins always come out light and fully and delicious.  \r\nI use a combination of whole wheat flour, flax meal and oatmeal for the flour and a combo of mashed bananas and maybe only 1 tbps of canola oil.  I add blueberries, walnuts and a small amount of chocolate.  Sometimes I also add shredded zucchini.  My kids, husband and all of our friends love these!  Fail proof!","These were even better than I expected.  Honestly, I was torn between whether I should make these (the healthier version) or the originals...but I'm very glad I went for these because I honestly couldn't tell that they were made to be on the healthier side.  I halved the recipe and the yield was 16 muffins filled approximately 1\/2-3\/4 full.  Bake time for my oven was about 18 minutes.  Very easy and quick to throw together with good results and a nice flavor.  My 3 year old had two of them already this morning.  Thank you for posting, I'll be recommending this one to others and will definitely work it into the rotation again in the future!!!","Yummmmy!  I made them a little healthier by doing half sugar\/half splenda.  Also I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour.   They were still moist and delicious.","Just made these. They smelled wonderful in the oven. Unfortunately, mine didn't cook through on the bottom well and fell apart and stuck to the paper as I unwrapped them. Guess it was all the moisture from the applesauce and pumpkin. I noticed this on the first muffin I tested and extended the cooking time but didn't want the tops to burn. Gonna just slice them open and toast them as I eat them. Will definitely try again.","Best muffins ever!  I used whole wheat pastry flour, and coconut oil for the oil, and they were awesome.  My husband will force me to make these often I fear :-)  They did take closer to 20 minutes to cook fully through.","Very tasty!  My kids love these.\nI use half whole wheat flour for the flour and cut the sugar to 1 cup.\nI used Recipe #78579 for nonstick coating and it works like a dream.  I used the rubber muffin pans and cooked 6 in the microwave for 3 minutes.  It says you shouldn't need non stick coating in the rubber pans but I always have issues so the non stick stuff works better than paper wrappers.  Enjoy!!","Yum!  I used Splenda, and Hershey's cinnamon chips instead of chocolate.  Excellent warm with a glass of milk.  Thanks for posting!","Yum!  I subbed 1 tbsp of flaxseed + 3 tbsp of water for one of the eggs, subbed 1 c of oatmeal, and 2\/3 cup of WW flour, with the remaining 1 1\/3 cup being regular flour, added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of vanilla, and cut the mini chips back to 3\/4 cup.  Just trying to health them up a bit more even.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!","Very yummy muffins.  My modifications were:  egg substitute, no oil (added 1\/2 cup applesauce), 3\/4 cup sugar plus 1\/2 cup splenda, 2.5 cup flour plus 1\/2 cup oat bran and only 10 oz. mini chips.  They were so moist - it's amazing there is so little fat.  Thanks for sharing!","What a muffin!  Made half without chips & half with regular choc chips. (didn't have mini)  I had without first & decided 4\u00c2\u00bd or 5 stars.  Then after the choc chip one, my DIL said 6 stars!  Absolutely delicious!!","Yummy. 5 WW pts per full muffin","Delicious muffins!  Made them exactly as posted and my only complaint is that the muffins stick to the paper cups and so much is lost with the wrapping.  I will either try them without the paper cups, or go for the un-light version.  Wonderful flavor and enjoyed by all.  Thanks!","Excellent recipe.  I made a half recipe since I only had 1\/2 can of pumpkin left.  So, I cut everything in half.  I also added less than half the sugar (only 1\/2 cup).  I used only 1\/2 c of miniature chocolate chips which was more than enough.  Next time I will use 1\/4 cup if I am doing a half recipe.  I also used all whole wheat flour and all applesauce (no oil).  THese were delicious and my kids loved them, too.  I will be making again!!!!","This has been my go to Fall recipe for the past 3 years!! I LOVE that they are low in fat AND ever so moist. I have replaced All the oil for applesauce and they get a bit rubbery in texture, plus they stick to the papers as noted by others. I would recommend adding 1\/2 the oil recommended and grease the inside of the papers. I like more spice, so i add nutmeg. Try substituting Butterscotch chips for an Extra yummy treat!!! I also do agree about the amount of choc chips- although i love chocolate- it does overpower the pumpkin flavor a bit, so for a more \"grown-up\" fall flavor, I would suggest halving the choc chips. I have raved and recommended this recipe to many friends and co-workers!","What a treat! I made these for my grandchildren. They love pumpkin bread, pumpkin muffins, pumpkin bars.... These with the mini chips were a hit.","I used fresh pumpkin.  I first cut it all up, steamed it, and the flattened it all with a fork.  I then measured it out to 16oz, and then put it in a blender with the 1\/2 c of oil.  I live somewhere where it is hot everyday, and lots of humidity, so I did refrigerate the batter before I baked it. It turned out really good. Thanks for the recipe","This is a great recipe. I made both muffins and a loaf of pumpkin bread. The bread turned out better than the muffins. My muffins took longer to bake than stated in the recipe, but other than that everything was perfect. Perfect balance of chocolate and pumpkin. I used half wheat flour and half white in my bread and muffins and half the amount of sugar. I'll make this again! Thanks, Marg.","They were surprisingly GRRRRRREAT!  I was VERY unsure about pumpkin and chocolate chips...  Like other's suggested, I added a little oil with the apple sauce (about 1 tbsp).  I used cinnamon apple sauce & also added in about 1 tsp extra.  I added a little nutmeg and allspice as well.  About 1 tsp. vanilla flavor and 1 tsp. butter flavoring were added-it's what I had on hand.  Like others said, I only added 6 oz. of chocolate chips-i think any more would have overpowered the flavors of the pumpkin.  Oh, and I mashed up half a banana and mixed it in as well...   I experimented with this one and it really paid off.  Please guys...feel free to play around with this recipe-it is super versatile!","I love this recipe, It is so easy and delicious! <br\/>I also add one teaspoon of nutmeg as I find it gives it more flavour.<br\/>The first time I used this recipe I used white chocolate buttons as that was all I had and it really was good, almost better then brown chocolate.<br\/>For cooks outside of the US or where canned pumpkin is unavailable  I have used 1cup of crown pumpkin and one cup of butternut pumpkin diced and heated in the microwave and then stick blended, if you cant find butternut try 1 1\/2 cups of crown and 1\/2 a cup of kumara or sweet potato. Always cook the veges in the microwave or oven rather then boiling them as the extra moisture will give you a (unwanted) thinner puree","Just as good as the full fat version. Made in Wilton silicon cups - made 28. 400 degrees 16 minutes. Mini chips would be better but all I had was the big ones.","Good muffins! Added 2t vanilla and used only 1 cup regular chocolate chips. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","I made these using only 1 cup of sugar.  They were wonderful.  Thanks for posting.","My whole family loves these! We didn&#039;t have any chocolate chips, so I used white and they give it a cream cheesy flavor. :). I doubled it and subbed 2 cups of flour with whole wheat pastry flour. I added a handful of wheat germ and ground golden flax. I added 1\/2 tsp of nutmeg, a few good shakes of cloves, and at least 2 tsps vanilla to the double batch. Thank you - I&#039;ll make these again!","amazing muffins . try addind choped wallnut","I made these muffins last night and my family really enjoyed them.

It was moist, but firm so it was easy to cut into bite sized cubes without getting mushy.  Delicious!","My home smelled delicious when I was preparing this!  I donated 4 loaves to our school bake sale - and they went fast!  Very moist and rose nicely.","One word -- yummmy!  \r\nI made this on a whim because I had extra pumpkin.  My husband took a loaf for his office Thanksgiving luncheon.  I got so many requests for this recipe that I decided to take 4 loaves to our family for Thanksgiving and am making 2 more loaves right now for our lunch guests coming tomorrow.","Delicious. Wonderfully moist, with a great flavor. I've made this a few times now, and it is always a hit. Thanks!!","A wonderful and easy recipe to follow. My friends thought it was delicious and asked for the recipe!","Very good and really easy to make!!","Easy to make.  We were out of ground cloves, but it was good anyway.  Next time we are going to try applesauce instead of oil.","This is awesome. I like it even better than Starbucks. Theirs is a heavier more dense bread and this one is light and fluffy. I cooked mine for about 80 minutes and i think it turned out perfect. Thank you for this awesome recipe. I will be making this for many years to come. It was so simple and easy to bake. A definate winner in my book!!!","This recipe produced fabulous results! The bread was moist and tender, with a wonderful flavor.  I made one loaf and 12 muffins and took them into the office. I received many compliments and was asked to share the recipe, along with a comment that the individual hoped \"I can make them as moist as you did!\"  This is a keeper!","This is an outstanding recipe. My boyfriend who is not a huge quickbread..or pumpkin fan..raved about it. He even asked me to make another batch so he could have some in his lunch everyday. Quite an endorsement from one so picky!","This is almost an exact version of Recipe #195348 (which doesn't have cloves, but I added the same amount that is here), which, to me, is also 5 stars. I made this recipe, without the healthy substitutes, and I added 1 tsp. vanilla to the wet ingredients. This bread makes the house smell so good, and turns out really well. Mine was done in 55 min. I am looking forward to trying the applesauce version, though. Thanks so much for posting that alternative!!","I completely forgot to add the 4 eggs and this bread still turned out wonderfully! I made 1 loaf with diced pecans and 1 loaf without and both are delicious. Thanks for sharing!","I made this for my son's preschool class and it was a big hit.  I used the applesauce substitute, but I can't wait to use the \"sinful\" recipe with all the sugar and oil!","Wonderful!\r\nI love to add a little vanilla, leave out the water b\/c I use fresh pumpkin, add nuts and sometimes even some chocolate chips.  Thank you!","The best pumpkin bread recipe I have tried!  Easy - had everything on hand - and delicious!","This is excellent bread. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, 3\/4 c applesauce, and 1\/4 c oil.  Delicious, and will be made again. Thank you.","My husband does not like pumpkin pie, banana bread, zuccini bread, or carrot cake, yet he gave this recipe his stamp of approval!  I am so relieved to find a festive bread that he actually enjoys.  Thank you, Marg!  \nAs others noted, I added 1 cup golden raisons (per loaf) with great results.","A friend gave me this recipe, and I'm not a pumpkin bread lover.  This recipe is so moist and delicious I was pleasantly surprised.  Thank you!","i loved the recipe.  the only issue i had was there were to many cloves in it so i took out half the cloves and added ginger now the bread tastes just like pumpkin pie.  i have neighbors begging me for it whenever i make it and i have to fight my kids and husband for a single slice   thanks","Delicious!  The bread came out perfectly.  I took it to work, and it was very popular with everyone.  I didn't have any leftovers!\n\nI'm making it for Turkey-Day this week, and I think I'll add walnuts to one of the loaves.  Mmmm.","Wonderful recipe! I made this in three small loaf pans and I'm taking one to my sister tomorrow when we go to her house for Thanksgiving dinner. It will make a great breakfast treat with a good cup of coffee. I used a cream cheese glaze on mine and it complements the bread beautifully. Love this, thanks for sharing the recipe.","This was excellent. First time I have ever made pumpkin bread and everyone loved it. It was nice and moist with a lot of great flavor. I added black walnuts since my boyfriend loves them and I had a bag of them laying around. I am going to make more this weekend. Thank you for this great recipe. Its a keeper, for sure.","This is so good! It is so moist. I substituted 3 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice for the spices listed in the recipe. I baked this in mini loaf pans for Christmas gifts at church. I put 3\/4 cup batter in each pan and it made 8 mini loaves. I baked it at 325 for 45-50 minutes. I will try next time substituting applesauce for some of the oil. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is wonderful!","I've made many recipes of pumpkin bread but this recipe got rave reviews from everyone.  Great job and thanks for sharing.\r\n(I did however add raisins and walnuts)","Very good! It was soft and sweet. I used the applesauce and oil. stayed moist for a long time. I did how ever use pumpkin pie spice + the cinnamon insted of the others because it was what I had on hand. I will be useing this recipe in the future.","Well, this is my Holy Grail of pumpkin bread recipes: easy, delicious, wonderful texture and moist.","It really tasted wonderful! I used the lower fat applesauce version and reduced sugar to a little less than a cup. I added about \u00c2\u00bd cup of raisins and pecans. I substituted 3 Tbsp. of wheat bran (for a bit of a fiber boost) for 3 Tbsp. of flour. I used my own canned pumpkin and weighed it out on a kitchen scale. Added 1 tsp. of vanilla since I canned my pumpkin without any spices.  I made a half recipe so I put all the liquid ingredients in the food processor with the pumpkin chunks. It worked out beautifully. Give this recipe a try. It is simple and will make everyone hungry just smelling it cook. Jim in So. Calif.","Really good texture and flavor.  I made this at work and based on the reviews I made a 4x batch.  \nI ended up adding some pecans and raisins to a few of the loaves,  Great recipe.","I rated this recipe a 4 because when I made this bread it did not rise as it should have- or even at all. It remained very dense. I'd advise that you make sure your baking powder is not old (like mine most likely was) before baking this bread. In addition, even with extra spice added, the bread was not as spice intense as I'd hoped. After a day of trying to let flavors meld deeper it was still not as flavorful as I like it. However, it was still good! Thanks for posting.","I made the low fat version with applesauce and less sugar - and the bread came out fantastic. I made a full size loaf and a dozen muffins (the muffins I baked for about 22 minutes) They turned out extremely moist and very tasty.","Very Good!!  I used pumpkin pie filling as that is what I had on hand and it worked well!","sooooo yummy! i actually added rasins and frosted it with powdered sugar frosting! i know it naughty but so good!","I loved this bread. The only thing that I did different was to use 2-1\/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice but also added the cloves. I made one loaf and 12 muffins. My family just loved them that's why I'm baking another batch as I write this :) Definately a keeper, thank for sharing!","SO yummy!  I also made 12 muffins and 1 loaf of bread.  I had planned on freezing the loaf but the family went through 8 muffins at dinner so I think I better keep the loaf out for breakfasts and snacks tomorrow!  :)","I made the healthy version and it was super moist and scrumptious!! I did double the the spices per the reviews of others and it was PERFECT... absolute perfection. I would give it 10 stars if i could. only other change i did was to add chocolate chips for my husband :-)","I substituted non-fat plain yogurt for the oil and it came out perfect-very moist. I also doubled the cinnamon but left the other spices as written and it was perfect for our tastes. So good when still warm from the oven!","This bread is wonderful!  I substituted fresh pumpkin for the canned and didn't add water.  I also used the healthy version of the recipe.  It is very good and I highly recommend it.  I've passed it on to other people.  Thank you for posting it.","Wow, great bread. I did substitute all spices with 3 teaspoons cinnimon and touch of nutmeg. Thanks for sharing.","Stellar!  I used fresh pumpking and homemade applesauce, which were a little more watery and so I omitted with 1\/2 cup water entirely.  In one loaf I mixed in raisins and dried cranberries, which turned out great.","This is by far one of the best pumpkin breads I have ever made.  It went together so easy and the house was smelling wonderful within minutes.  I made it exactly as written and it turned out beautifully.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!","Very tasty, very moist bread! I used one cup sugar and one cup 100% maple syrup (omitted third cup of sugar), which gave a very nice, subtle maple sweetness. I also used only 3\/4 cups oil and omitted the 1\/2 cup water (to make up for the extra liquid of the maple syrup). Next time I would like to use applesauce and may also add some dark chocolate chips - yum!","Just made this.  It is pretty good, but even 60 minutes was a bit too long.  I think it needs more cinnamon, the cloves seemed fairly strong in contrast with the other spices.  I will make it again with changes.  Oh, I did make it with the applesauce instead of the oil and it was very moist.","YUM, YUM, YUM!  This is fantastic.  I made the bread, but I also made mini-muffins from the recipe (cooked in about 12 minutes).","This was great - I reduced the cloves as I'm not too fond of them, added 1\/4 tsp ground star anise, and a package of Nestle chocolate chips.  Also used 1\/3 bread flour, 1\/3 whole wheat flour, and 1\/3 all purpose flour.  (I wouldn't recommend this unless adding the chocolate chips.)","Made a bunch of changes, nothing too drastic.  Put 1 scant cup brown sugar and 1 scant cup white sugar, used the 'alternatives', doubled the spices and added 1\/2 cup oats instead of the last cup of flour, all of which was whole wheat. Oh, and I sprinkled in some ground flax.\nBut the kicker was when I forgot to add the eggs and baked them into muffins, and they still turned out delicious! A little dense, but I certainly surprised myself!","I did exactly what the recipe called for and it turned out AMAZING!  It's great for a sweet tooth or for breakfast.  It's so moist and delicious. Best pumpkin spice bread EVER!","My family and I are eating this delicious bread as I type! Seriously, look no further if you are looking for \"the\" pumpkin bread recipe. The crust on the bread is nice and crispy, but not tough or thick. The inside is moist and flavorful. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to the wet ingredients, and some ginger to the dry ingredients. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Marg... it's our new family favorite!","I also used my own pumpkin, cooked and blenderized, and it worked out great. Instead of cloves I used cardamom, and I used part whole wheat flour. Overall nice warm taste and good texture. I do not have 2 loaf pans, so I put half the batter in a square cake pan. It worked well, and I could see making it again this way in order to top with a cream cheese icing.","I made these into muffins for my children rather than a loaf.  The only reason for 4 stars is that 1 cup of sugar is enough!  I used butternut squash and mashed it myself.  Flavours are wonderful.  It made 20 large muffins.  I made half plain and half with choc chips.  The plain were great with butter, choc chip ones were great on their own.  Thanks for the recipe - a keeper!!!\r\nElizabeth","Yummy yummy yummy!! Everyone loved. Thanks","Outstanding!  I used fresh pumpkin, just 3 eggs (ran out, but 3 worked fine) and 1\/2 cup oil.  I also added some ginger to the recipe and a cored, skined apple that I used the blender to dice in to small pieces.  The bread was extremely moist and tasted great.  Next time I think I'll add some chocolate chips to one of the loafs.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.","A great bread for the holidays. It is moist, flavorful and makes two large loaves. One to give away and one to have with coffee for us! I used two cups of sugar and loved the spice combination. Thanks for making our holiday season extra yummy! Carole in Orlando","I have been meaning to do this review for almost a year.  This is the BEST pumpkin bread recipe I've found.  I have passed it on to all of my friends.  Folks, before you start making changes to this recipe, try it as Marg posted it.  It's great exactly as it's written.  I love the cloves in the recipe.  Adds just the right touch.","The first time I make a recipe I always make it as it is posted and I am so glad I did that this time because it is perfect!  Great recipe--the only thing I would maybe do differently is add a little more spices (like slightly heaping) as a matter of personal taste and some vanilla but really the recipe is great as is!  It is absolutely a great fall recipe and today was overcast and just felt like a baking kind of day...my house smells wonderful from this bread!","A nice loaf.  I made my own pumpkin, so omitted the water (like another reviewer) and cut the sugar to 2 cups.  Next time I may add a tablespoon or so of molasses.  Looking forward to trying with applesauce!","I made this bread with the applesauce option and 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar. I honestly felt a bit letdown, it just wasn't very \"pumkin-ey\". I made a cream cheese glaze which helped the bread a bit, but my vacuum cleaner hubby was the only one who really ate it.","This exact recipe has been in our family for over 40 years, and we just love it! Our kiddos are disgustingly healthy (thank God!), so I don't worry about the cup of oil...we don't make it every week, and olive oil works perfectly well. <br\/>I do make these changes: I use half regular flour and half white whole wheat flour. It adds a mice nutty texture, and some health benefits. I also tend to bake it in a 9x13 pan, since I have bad luck getting it fully bakes in loaf pans. <br\/>Our recipe calls for 2\/3 cup water. I'll try cutting it to see if loaf pan baking works better- so thanks for that! :)<br\/>This bread is quick and easy to make, and sooo delicious! It's really tasty as a side dish with any poultry dish, and the kids love it for breakfast. Yum!","I pulled the loaves out of the oven 20 minutes ago and just finished my first slice. I am in LOVE with this recipe! I am adding this to my personal recipe collection immediately! I made this just as written with no substituions and it turned out amazing! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!","Very Good! I followed the suggested recipe (subbing applesauce for most of the oil, reducing the sugar - although i used one cup reg sugar and one cup brown, becuase thats all i had). I also added a good cup of reconstituted raisins. The bread came out much darker than the picture shown ( ill figure out how to post the pic i took of my loaf later), But it was still delicious. waiting for the final verdict from my Best friend who is a pumpkin bread fanatic.","So yummy!  I've made this recipe several times and this is what I do:  I use 1 1\/2 c sugar, add a bit of vanilla to the pumpkin mixture, and in addition to the spices listed in the recipe, I add 1 (heaping) teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  This gives it a bit more flavor and a little ginger, too.  And, I find that 60 min is too long--50 minutes and then letting it sit in the pans for another half hour seems to work with my crazy oven.<br\/><br\/>I also add a pkg of milk choc chips and it's so delicious!","I used this recipe to make little pumpkin \"muffins\". You'll need about 3 muffin pans if you plan to do it that way, and they get a bit more of a \"crust\" if you don't put them in the little cupcake liners, which IMO adds a bit of extra depth to the overall taste\/texture of the muffins.<br\/><br\/>While we like the recipe \"as-is\", I'd definitely make some changes. I think I'd add a tad more spice, as it seems rather bland, although, some of this is cured after it fully cools and has time to sit--no eating them warm from the oven!<br\/><br\/>Also, I don't know if anyone else noticed, but mine are a bit sticky to the touch even after being baked...I'm debating on adding a touch more flour next time to help reduce that so that they store a bit better. I also definitely plan to make the the healthier way next time, because I'd bet that really adds to the texture of the bread.<br\/><br\/>Thanks for the recipe Marg!!! My little one is driving me crazy about pumpkin \"cookies\". ;-)","Outstanding recipe! This is the second time I have made this and it has come out great every time. My husband and kids love it, it's great in the morning with a cup of hot tea. I followed the recipe but did use additional spices to pump up the flavor a bit. One thing I really like about this recipe is that all the ingredients (except the pumpkin, possibly) are all staples most people have in their pantry.","I liked it. The recipe was fine as is. It was light and nice. I did take some liberties and tweak it the next time I made it. I did half coconut oil and half applesauce, half the sugar, added vanilla, extra spices, doubled the pumpkin and skipped the water. LOVED it that way! It had the flavor of pumpkin pie but it was still light and fluffy.","Very good recipe! I followed it to the line and liked it a lot. However, next time I'll try using more spices and maybe reduce the sugar a bit, as I found it maybe too sweet. But I suggest following the recipe as it is and make adjustments later according to your personal taste.","A Definite Keeper. I split one loaf and shared it with neighbors.

I did add chocolate chips to the recipe for additional flavour, but they were yummy the way they were.  Thank you.","Try creaming the sugar and butter instead of melting it. Also I added shredded coconut to mixture and melted choc chips on top.

Be sure to use THIN cuts of boneless chicken so it fries up crisp.  Too thick a piece makes the coating soggy and therefore less edible.  This sauce will work best with rendered chicken fat.

At any rate, it did make a nice midweek meal and I will explore other chicken and almond recipes.","I was looking for a recipe for Almond Chicken Soo Guy, and this was very close- I guess that's what we call it in Canada! It was very good, although I didn't have any homemade chicken stock, which would greatly improve the sauce.

Thanks so much for the recipe it is the closest thing we have found to it.We will be useing this in our kitchen regularly.Do you by chance have a good egg drop soup recipe?","I live in Montana and here they call this deep-fried chicken with almond gravy...whatever you call it it's darn good! Thank you!","Being a fellow Michiganian, I thought the sauce was dead on!!!!  Only complaint that was heard this evening was from my DH who actually fried the chicken, was maybe 2 eggs would have worked better.  But we both agreed that when recipes are written, who knows what size of eggs are really used.  And who knows if the same sizes are offered in the areas.  Or, no offense to the momma chicks, but do they always lay the same sized eggs!!!  LOL.  Tonkcats, great recipe and we will be making over and over, well at least until the DS goes off to college!!!!  LOL This is his favorite dish :o)","I grew up in MI where I could get Almond Boneless Chicken at any Chinese restaurant I walked into. When I moved to NC I quickly learned that it was regional since no Chinese restaurant here knew what it was. This came in as a close second to the traditional Almond Boneless Chicken I can get at my favorite Chinese Restaurant. Thank you so much for posting it!","I have been looking for a recipe similar to this for a long time.  I live in Canada just across the river from Detroit, and our Chinese restaurants have served this as far back as I can remember.  I haven't tried the recipe yet, but I am hopeful it is the one I have been looking for.  I will rate and review it properly once I try it, but for now am giving it five stars in anticipation!","I had no idea that this was a regional recipe either. Our whole family just loves it when we go out to eat. I made it last night and it was absolutely fabulous!!! I too left out the sherry and mushrooms. The sauce is dead on, but I can't quite figure out how to fix the batter so it's more like the restaurant version. I was thinking maybe it should have salt in it and omit the baking powder so it crisps up more like a fried chicken batter????","I also grew up in Detroit enjoying this dish. And it is true, you cannot find it out of state. This is a recipe I have been hoping for since I moved away from Ann Arbor. Thanks for taking me home again! Hope Bill Woo's is still open! He would be proud.","This is definitely not something you can get in south Florida where I now live. I used to order this every week at my local Chinese restaurant, and still do whenever I visit Michigan.<br\/>This recipe is good. The sauce is right on but the batter is wrong. First of all, forget the baking powder. Instead of using water, try clubsoda. It will give your chicken a crispier tempura like texture.Make sure the batter is on the thin side so that it dredges off easily. Use peanut oil or don't make this dish! Regular veg or corn oil cannot get hot enough to really crisp the chicken without setting off smoke alarms!<br\/>Also, the sauce does require 1\/4 teaspoon of real Almond Extract to give it the authentic restaurant flavor we Michiganders know and love. Forget the mushrooms. They just water down the gravy. Use Iceberg Lettuce. It is the coldest, crunchiest to offset the warmth of the chicken and gravy.<br\/>I know this works because I experimented with this recipe until it was just like my favorite Chinese haunts in suburban Detroit.<br\/>Also, change out the chicken for duck and make it Wor Su Opp!","dredge ckn in pancake mix .  found that recipe on bob allison site he is a detroiter who worked  at local am radio stations .  he has many old detroit restaurant recipes from back in the day  . the sauce recipe here is better than the one he has listed .   watch the size of ckn pces as it will double or triple in size .","Not 100% like I remember, but wasn't bad. After reading reviews I didn't use the baking powder. Also left out the mushrooms. Also, put 1\/4 teaspoon of Almond Extract in the sauce. I used 2 TBS clubsoda in the batter (1 was not enough). Used peanut oil for frying. The directions didn't mention when to add the dry sherry, so I just included it in the peanut oil. Took about 7 mins each side to cook through. Was easy to put together, but will try other recipes.","Tonkat: just thought I&#039;d let you know that over in Seattle, where I used to live in a suburb called Ravenna\/Lake City, there&#039;s a fantastic blast from the past called Ying&#039;s Chinese Food Drive In. When I lived there, they delivered THE best Almond Chicken with brown gravy you have ever tasted! I crave Ying&#039;s Almond Chicken from here in Honolulu some 20 years later! And more awesome is the fact they&#039;ve not changed a thing since back then: same signage, chairs, menu on the wall and polaroids of each dish, it&#039;s all like a time warp! Check out the picture from yelp: http:\/\/m.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yings-drive-in-seattle?select=jly1qsp2YXJIs70_ds11Ng I know there are some bad reviews there, lol. But that chicken was tender white meat with the lightest dark brown crispy coating, covered with their ruch, saviry","I&#039;m really looking forward to trying this recipe. I&#039;ve been looking for a recipe for wor su gai for a long time. This is also a staple in Ohio. I&#039;ve never been able to duplicate the wonderful brown gravy. Here in northern OH it&#039;s also served with ice cold lettuce to enhance the hot chicken. It&#039;s covered in a brown sauce &amp; topped with chopped peanuts &amp; sliced green onion. Sauce sounds just what I&#039;m looking for, this was always served with fried rice at our restaurants here. Since I&#039;ve moved I&#039;m still finding wor su gai but it&#039;s served over bean sprouts and with a gelatinous yellow sauce that reminds me of lemon pudding. Can&#039;t wait to try this! Thanks Tonkats! Left 4 stars in anticipation!!","The salt and the sherry is a marinade for the chicken. &quot;Sprinkle chicken with salt and sherry and marinate for 15 minutes.&quot;\nI know it&#039;s not much liquid but that&#039;s the deal. It&#039;s explained in a somewhat similar recipe here: http:\/\/www.americanfoodroots.com\/50-states\/abcs-michigan-almond-boneless-chicken\/\nThe best ABC in my city is only 5 minutes away so I don&#039;t have much motivation to make my own. Mean Chef&#039;s, General Tso&#039;s Chicken, on this site is better than what I can buy so I do make that.","Makes a lot of gravy for two chicken breasts. Maybe serve 4 instead.\nDon&#039;t forget chopped scallions, makes all the difference.","I moved from Washington State to California and now Arizona. All of the Chinese dishes are different. Almond chicken here and in Ca. is cubed chicken and vegetables with almonds. BBQ pork in Washington was pork tenderloin sliced thin with Chinese mustard. Here and in Cal. it is a reddish, fatty, ham like texture. I prefer the Chinese American Restaurants in Washington. Red Lotus in Auburn, WA was a family favorite when I was a kid. This is good but, I too, lightened up the batter by leaving out the baking powder and using club soda. More like a tempera batter and clear gravy with chopped almonds, no mushrooms.","I made this several months ago, using duck breast. I followed the directions exactly, and it came out very much like our local restaurant used to fix, bit not quite. I'm going to fix it again this week and follow the &quot;club soda&quot; and peanut oil and almond extract. However, I'll keep the mushrooms, using fresh instead of canned to keep the moisture content low. This is one of my favorite ways to make duck breast.

I actually used half olive oil and half rice bran oil for the oil and the olive oil added a really nice flavor as well.  I think that this might be nice with some spicing added as well- maybe some basil or italian seasoning or onion or even cheese or whatever.  I think  some sunflower seeds would be really nice.  Really lovely as-is.  I did find that the texture was pretty crumbly and it did not slice very well.

There was enough juice to drizzle over the pieces of pie (even though I forgot to add butter to the filling). The apples were cooked to just the right texture:  not crunchy, but not soggy, either.   I used my own crust recipe and  substituted fresh Meyer lemon juice for the rind in the filling. What made it comfort food for my family was a heaping spoonful of my grandmother's vanilla sauce on top, which is basically the recipe on the side of the Argo Cornstarch box.

I can't comment on the taste, since the girl took it home to her family, but I really WISH I could've tasted it...it looked beautiful (we did an egg-water wash with baker's sugar crystals on the top crust); she also was tickled pink to get to use a lemon zester for the very first time in her life!!!.

Thank you, Dancer^, for an outstanding recipe.","Very good pie and I will make it again!Thank you,Dancer","Loved this pie!  Megan","Very easy to make. I didn't have any nutmeg on hand so I had to omit it. Instead of regular butter I used vegan butter, which tends to be a little saltier than regular butter.

I used my easy spelt pie crust on this pie.  I used 1\/2 cup cane sugar and 1\/2 cup Z-Sweet sugar substitute.  I knew this would make the pie less sweet, but thats the way my DH likes it, and I figured low carb is better for me anyway.  I brushed the top with some Nu Laid egg replacer and sprinkled the pie with a little Z-Sweet to give the crust a crunch.  We ate this with a nice dollop of light whipped cream. Thanks for the tasty and simple recipe.  I will make this one again.","Wow, this was my first time making an apple pie and it came out BEAUTIFULLY.  I am hopeless at any sort of baking (to be fair, I bought the crust), but this pie was spectacular.  I used a little less cinnamon (1.5 tsp.) and a little more nutmeg (0.5 tsp). The lemon zest really added something extra, I never would have thought of it.  This recipe is easy and delicious, I will definitely be making this again!","Fantastic. I made it today and everyone like it a lot. Disappear in minutes.\r\nThe filling is like \"McDonalds Apple Pie\"!\r\nI had reduced cinnamon and nutmeg. I'll try next time adding some ground cardamom.\r\nFantastic.","great combination of ingredients.  however, it was just a bit too cinnamony for me, so i plan on using a little less next time.  overall great taste!","I thought there was way too much cinammon so I knocked it down to a tablespoon and still thought the flavor was overpowering. Didn't have a whole lot of time so I bought refrigerated pie crust (kind that's rolled, NOT frozen) Didn't add the lemon either. Pie would have been 5 stars and EXCELLENT if it wasn't for the mucho cinnamon taste.","The other day, our 21 year old son, who's never baked a pie in his life, decided it would be a good day to give it a whirl.  We came home to a house that smelled fabulous and a gorgeous looking apple pie complete with lattice top which tasted as good as it looked.  Very juicy and with a tender crust.

I used this recipe for the apple filling in several pies that I made over our Canadian Thanksgiving week and have had the recipe requested numerous times!  I adjusted the cinnamon to just 1 tbsp and didn't have lemon zest so left it out and everything was delicious!","The best apple pie we've ever had!! The only change we made was slightly cutting back the cinnamon and lemon zest. However, the lemon zest made this recipe amazing... making the flavor of the apples very complex.

The crust came out well, but my rolling job wasn't the best.  It smelled wonderful, next time I'm going to put sugar on the crust.  I dont know if it was the types (used a variety) of apples but it came out watery, maybe add more flour next time. This is good and will make it again.","This is our favorite recipe for apple pie.  I usually use store bought pie crusts,I use one for the crust itself and I roll out the other one and make a lattice decoration out of it to lay across the top.  For the pie I use one extra tablespoon of flour, more cinnamon and also more nutmeg.  I also sprinkle lemon juice all over the sliced apple which makes the spices and flour and sugar stick better.  I haven't tried the lemon zest, I figured I had enough lemon flavor with the juice.  Very easy and delicious!!","Smashing recipe!  The only change I made was I used a bit less than a tablespoon of cinnamon instead of the full 1.5 tablespoons.  It was a hit for Thanksgiving!  Thanks!","I used this for Thanksgiving. I would have given it five stars except that the lemon made the pie more sour than we cared for. However the other flavors were good and I'll definitely try this one again without the lemon. (I'll also try mixing in some sweeter apples. As a new pie baker I'm never quite sure what apples would be best.) Thanks a lot for an excellent recipe!","Super cinnamon-y! We were running out of time, so only made the filling and used a store-bought crust. Nicely filled with apples and juicy. Next time I'd try and drain the apples a bit more, since the bottom got a bit soggy. I'd definitely make it again and make the crust from scratch next time.","This was a wonderful pie!

I especially loved the lemon zest...it gave it that something extra.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe...it will be my standing apple pie recipe from now on!","WHY DOES IT TASTE SO GOOD?!?!\nit's amazing. i messed up horribly with the crust because i kept on not adding enough cold water, and then i added too much cold water **slaps head** BUT IT STILL TURNED OUT GREAT\nas the other reviews stated, i turned down the amount of cinnamon\noh, and i left out the lemon just because i forgot","The perfect apple pie.  I've made this twice now and got rave reviews both times.  The only change I made to the recipe was removing the butter since we eat kosher-style and need dairy-free desserts.  Even without the butter this was still juicy and delicious.  I use a mandolin to slice the apples very thin which makes a nice texture inside the pie.  Thanks for such a great recipe!","We could not believe how wonderful this pie was. I will not have to look for another apple pie recipe again. Perfect every time no matter what apple I choose. Thank You","It was a really good apple pie. I used 3 yellow delicious and 4 granny smiths. When i read the recipe I wondered about the cinnamon it seemed to be a lot so I used only half.

I have another in the oven, made with a different kind of apple, hopefully it turns out less watery\/juicy.","This pie was so perfect & delicious!  The crust was the highlight.  It tasted like a sugar cookie :)  To make the pie less runny, I have read that you can add cornstarch.  I have also heard that it is good to stick with Granny Smith's and (Eastern) Golden Delicious apples.  I took everyone's advice and used only 11\/2 teaspoons of cinnamon & lemon juice instead of zest.","Good base, but way too much cinnamon for our taste.","WOW - What a great recipe. Finally - an apple pie with some flavor. I will be making this again without changing anything.","The pie turned out really good, there was so much sauce though? Did we do something wrong?  \n\nCaution! This is an extremely sweet pie! If you don't like sweet stuff, lower the sugar content to maybe 2\/3 or 1\/2 (depends on you). I loved that the pie was so easy to make, the crust is perfect! will use it again in other pies. I also followed the advice of others and used less cinnamon, barely a tablespoon. We also used less lemon zest, less than 1\/4 teaspoon because others had stated that this pie could get kind of bitter! It was perfect! We also only used five apples, they were big though! We used granny smiths and golden delicious! Perfect with a hint of tartnes and sweetness.  \n\nCan someone explain why my apple pie has so much sauce? It was overfilling and extremely sweet!","This is just about the same recipe I use. I bought 7 Granny Smith apples for the pie & followed the recipe except for the lemon zest, I felt it didn't need it. I added a tiny bit more flour as it was quite soupy, I love cinnamon so I added the whole amount. Very good pie, we had it while it was still barely warm the some vanilla custard ice-cream on it, ummmmm!","i was looking for a new apple pie recipe and i thought i would try this one.  i found the crust was hard to work with.  there just didnt seem to be enough.  the taste of the crust was great though.  there was too much cinnamon for us.  i think if i make it again i wouldnt even use half of it.  we didnt care for the lemon is it either.","Made for DH's birthday, apple pie instead of a cake he wished and was very pleased with this one!!  I used splenda instead of sugar and just used a half cup, also cut back on the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon and  used becel marg for the butter.  The pastry was fine, i used shortening, it made enough to fit easily in a 9 inch aluminum pie plate.  The only problem I had was that my apples were so juicey that when i took it out of the oven it was sitting in juice, so I quickly, while it was hot slipped it onto a plate, surprizingly it landed in one piece!!  It did stick to the plate but did come away ok to lift with a wide spatula.  It was delicious topped with a slice of cheddar cheese.  thanks for posting.","I used a mix of Gala and Granny Smith, they didn't turn out how I liked so I will have to play with the apples and see what suits my taste best, thinking Spartan might be good.   I absolutely loved the flakiness of the crust, it turned out perfect!  Spicing was done extremely well to my likings but if you aren't big on cinnamon I would suggest adding less.  I added a bit of cinnamon sugar to the top crust before baking to add a bit more sweetness.   Thanks for a great recipe.","After reading the reviews I decided to use less cinnamon (reduced to 1 tablespoon). This was still way too much even for cinnamon lovers like us. The apples were \"brown\" from the cinnamon rather than a nice apple color. I think if the cinnamon was reduced to teaspoons instead of tablespoons it would be a great pie but for our tastes, I think I'll keep searching.","This was sooo good!! I but the exact ingredients in it and it was awesome!! Best apple pie ever.  I have also never made an apple pie before.  And after reading the reviews people complained about too much cinnamon, I personally like cinnamon and I didn't think it had too much cinnamon.  I would make this again.","This is the 1st time I'm making an apple pie.  Simple and easy recipe. Nutmeg and cinnamon makes it heavenly ... It was simply delicious.  :-)\r\n\r\nAfter reading the review, I decided to reduce the cinnamon and sugar by half. Skip the lemon zest. Drain the excess liquid from the ingredient after mixing them up.  \r\n\r\nServe the apple pie last evening at a Christmas gathering. Little did I expect it was the men who love it. One of them asked me for the recipe so that his wife could bake it for him, the other friend wanted nothing to be brought home except the apple pie... Thank you Dancer for this wonderful recipe. I'm gonna bake this for many more occasions.","This was yummy! I used a different crust, \"My No Roll Pie Crust\nRecipe #51537\" and I made a strudel topping. Didn't have any lemon zest, so I left it out. It turned out great!","I knew the cinnamon was going to be over the top, so i reduced it to 1.5 tsp. i also used cloves instead of the nutmeg. and at the suggestion of my son i added a bag of dried cranberries to the apples. this was such a hit that it did not last long. i plan on making it many more times in the future.","Delicious! I didn't put the butter in the pie filling, did that by accident, but it still tasted great. This was my very first homemade pie so I was very proud to serve it to my husband and see him light up, he loves pie lol","This may be the best apple pie I have ever eaten, and certainly the best I have ever made!  I used 1 1\/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, as I had read reviews declaring the pie too-cinnamony, and I left out the lemon zest.  I have used this recipe twice, so far, one time using gluten-free flour.  My gluten-sensitive friend raved about it, too!","I was bringing the apple pie for dessert today, but the recipe wasn't where it was supposed to be---on the side of the Pillsbury Ready-Crust Box!!  But, leave it to Zaar and a great chef named Dancer^ to bail me out!  This was the best, the easiest.  Great recipe.  I used Cortland apples and only 1 1\/2 TEAspoons of cinnamon.  Did use the lemon zest, but was careful not to over do.  My pie ranked right up there with the chocolate Easter Bunnies that were running amok at my daughter's.  Thanks, Dancer^, for this wonderful recipe.","To start I should say I've never made a sweet pie before without using store-bought crusts.  This recipe is not only easy but also delicious!  The crust is super easy to make (used about 3 1\/2tbsp of water) and turned out VERY tender and flaky.  The only changes I made was to use 1\/2c brown sugar and 1\/2c white sugar, 1\/3c regular shortening and 1\/3c butter shortening (not actual butter, you can find this at any grocery store).  Other than that I used just 1tbsp of cinnamon and instead of the zest I used about 1tsp of lemon juice.  Thanks a mil for this recipe, it's a keeper :).","I adore this recipe, first of all. I've have never made an apple pie that worked for me, the crust was always either horribly wrong or the filling would be wrong or SOMETHING would always happen and it turned out awful. THIS one, however, THIS finally made me feel awesome because it turned out AMAZING! I used our own apples we grew, they're very, very tart and firm so they are excellent for baking. Everyone has their own tastes, and for me, this pie was not too sweet at all, but it might be because of the apples I used and because I happen to like sweet stuff. Anyway, the crust is awesome and I can believe how simple it is to make!! Tender and flaky and delicious ^_^ I did go on other reviewer's advice in using just 1 1\/2 TSPs of cinnamon, and it turned out fine. Love this, love this, love this! I finally have an apple pie my DH is begging me to make again! Thank you~!","I had some \"old man\" gala apples that needed to be used up and decided to try this recipe.  Oh my!  My DH said it was the best apple pie he had ever tasted and I agree.  It was juicy and the right balance of sweet and tart.  My go to recipe now.  Thanks for sharing.","Loved it.  A perfectly classic apple pie.  I LOVED the touch of lemon.  I did tweak it just a tiny bit.  I used a Trader Joe's pie crust, and they suggested brushing the pie with half-and-half (not water), then sprinkling it with sugar (I used Demara sugar).  It was fabulous!","Outstanding recipe - use brown sugar and it's even bettter.  I make this and give it to friends and relatives all the time.   Soothes even the most profound bout of pathos and despair!  Better than prescription drugs, no kidding.  Just kidding, but this is really a very good recipe.","It was a little too heavy on the cinnamon in our opinion, but I would make it again and just cut that back.","I have never made a pie before so I decided to go with this recipe and it turned out WONDERFUL!!! thank you for posting!!! I did cheat though and use a store bought crust so the next experiment is going to be making the crust :)","Very good! I used my own crust and a couple of more apples. Only change I'd make would be to use 1\/2 T cinnamon. I use Vietnamese cinnamon which is stronger than other types and thought that overwhelmed the pie. Not bad at all, my preference is just more apple flavor. The pie had the perfect amount of syrupy liquid. Lemon zest was a nice touch. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","I cheated and used the refrigerated pie crusts, otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe.  I used fresh lemon juice and a tiny bit less cinnamon.  It was delicious.  I used Granny Smith and a couple of different red apples for my apples.  I made this for my husband's birthday.  He was thrilled.","Great pie filling. I used a different recipe for the crust. I do have to say though, i don't like my apple pies juicy so i added a bit more flour to the filling and instead of lemon zest i just added juice from 1\/2 a lemon. All in all great recipe.","Way, way WAY too much cinnamon!  1-1\/2 TABLESPOONS ruined the pie -- and was inedible.","Made this for 4th of July bbq party- I used only 4 apples, but left the rest the same.  Made &quot;mini pies&quot; by cutting circles in the rolled out crust, and put them in a muffin tin, filled and topped with smaller circles.  Served the individual pies with a dollop of vanilla ice cream, and had rave reviews!  Many said it was the best they had tasted.  Thank you!","Excellent recipe!!!","My first try at making apple pie. Glad I chose this recipe. For my taste, it was perfection. I used Granny Smith apples and the filling was not syrupy sweet, but just right. And the lemon really adds that something special to the flavor. Nailed it. I used premade pie dough and it worked out fine.

Tasted good though.  I made it a second time and only thing I did different (I think, ha) was use alot more than 1 cup of pecans and chopped them up very fine.  Came out perfect.

I put some of the chopped on bottom of crust and put whole pecans and the rest of chopped pecans on the top. It adds a more complex nut flavor by roasting some and caramelizing the ones that rise from the bottom. \n**For those with problems. Make sure the rack is in the center of the oven, use an oven thermometer to make sure oven is correct temp. If it is browning more on one side rotate pie. I had to cook the pie for the full time plus a few more min. Pie is done when a toothpick inserted in the pie one inch from the side comes out clean. Dark brown sugar gives a darker pie. Make sure you use karo syrup that is only corn syrup and vanilla.","Delicious flavor.  I poured the pecans in the crust then poured the filling over it.  Glazed the pecans beautifully.  The baking time in the recipe is definitely off -- I baked closer to 60 - 70 minutes.  Thanks for posting it!","Fantastic pecan pie! Made it for my husbands birthday as he doesn't like cake and requested pecan pie. I think we've started a new tradition! We will be using this recipe from now on.

After I moved to New Orleans their pie was worth the wait for a seat :) And it was the closest pecan pie to the one my grandmother used to make. Not sure why people have mixed results - it's like making a custard pie so timing can vary in the cooking for many reasons. Just check for doneness and give yourself an extra 30 min in case it takes longer. Plus it's better when it is not right out of the oven. BTW at the Grill they would put it on the grill before serving to both warm it and also it makes sure there's no soft crust. Using real butter, real vanilla extract, dark instead of light brown sugar, and free range eggs if you can find (they are darker colored and add more richness). Also my grandma used half light Karo and half dark just to make it more flavorful. (I grew up thinking there was a nut called &quot;karo&quot; since she called this Karo Nut Pie!) My oven is futzy so I usually put a foil rim over the exposed crust toward the end of baking time. And like others posted, personally I prefer to dump the pecans in first and pour mixture over. I am transplanted to California and I noticed the pecans we get here (not local) seem more dry than the ones I would buy in the south. That might cause issues if you are putting the pecans on top if they don't have enough oil in them then they could possibly burn a bit. If that's the case just put them in before the filling and let them rise throughout the cooking - they will be more protected and also glazed at the end."],"vegetarian":"Y","pescetarian":"Y","vegan":"N","lactose intolerant":"N","gluten free":"Y","peanut allergy":"Y","kosher":"Y","halal":"N"},{"id":2586,"name":"bulgarian meatball soup","minutes":0,"ingredient_ids":[4189,5010,2159,2499,3184,6270,590,2683,437,4470,4287,2794],"ingredients":["lean ground beef","onion","dill weed","eggs","garlic","salt","black pepper","flour","beef broth","long grain rice","lemon, juice of","fresh dill"],"steps":["combine beef , onion , dillweed , 1 egg , garlic , salt and pepper in a large bowl","mix to combine ingredients thoroughly","shape into small balls and dredge lightly in the flour","set aside , heat the broth to boiling","drop the meatballs in","add the rice","lower the heat and cook about 35 minutes","add lemon juice and additional dill you can serve with a dollop of yogurt on top if you like",">from the kitchen of ramsgate"],"description":null,"calorie_level":2,"avg_rating":5.0,"review":["This is exactly what I was craving and more!

Both turned out wonderfully, so I will stick with the 0 calorie Pam.","I love tuna fish sandwiches so I thought I would try this.  I didn't add the chilies because we don't like them.  I tried putting the shells in the oven and also I tried frying some in the skillet with Pam.  I felt that the oven was the best way. I halved the amount of sour cream because I thought it was too runny.  I also added cheese in the mix to thicken it up some, plus I added some salt and mustard to give it more flavor.  I think I would have liked it better made with mayo instead of sour cream so it would have had more zing.  My review might not even be fair because we didn't use the chilies, so keep that in mind when reading this.  The chilies would have given it much more flavor.

I have never made lentil soup before, but this was pretty easy to follow, and very tasty.","Absolutely delicious! This soup was just what I was looking for, Carole.  It contains two ingredients I'm fond of, but wouldn't have thought of putting together: lentils and bulgur.  It also allowed me to use up some fresh spinach and parsley that I didn't want to go to waste, as we're going out of town in a few days. I had everything I needed, except the beef broth; so I substituted beef flavored \"Better Than Bouillon\" for it. Your directions mention garlic, but it's not listed with the ingredients.  I put in 1 tsp. of minced garlic.  I always keep a jar of it in the refrigerator. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.  I will be making it often.","My husband is very picky about soup and says this is possibly the best soup he has ever eaten!  It was wonderful.  I had to substitute vegetable broth for beef broth as my daughter is a strict vegetarian and found the lentils were tender after only simmering for about 15 minutes.  Also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic.","This is a great basic lentil soup.I think it would be a great soup to use up other veggies you have on hand.","As a self described soup freak, let me say, YUMMY!!  This was such a different lentil soup than I am used to. The cayenne gave it such an afterthought of a kick, GREAT! I made this vegetarian for my daugther & me and had my non lentil\/onion\/veggie\/soup eating hubby try it.  He came back \"don't tell me what's in it, just give me another bowl!\"  My dad who hates lentils, bowl and a half!  I made as written except used canned chopped tomatoes, dried parsley and veggie broth instead of beef.  This will be a repeat soup in my house.  I will post a photo tomarrow when I reheat for lunch!  Thanks Carole!!","Thought I would try this soup since I had all ingredients on hand to make it and ...... boy, am I glad I did! Wonderful flavor, different from the lentil soup I'm used to. The addition of spinach and bulgur really \"bulk up\" this soup. Filling, nutritious and very easy to make. You didn't specify  the amount of garlic so I used 3 fat cloves sliced very thin. The soup has an odd aroma (must be the bulgur) but you forget all about that once you taste it. So much fun finding a tasty new way to fix an old stand by (lentils). Thanks for posting Carole.","I had spinach and I don't like it raw.  I wanted to make a soup and had no white beans...I did have lentils.  \nSo I made this not at all excited.  \nBut, I should have been.\nThe soup was delicious.  It does need to  be salted heavily though.  My kids looked at it and said they wouldn't eat it so they were allowed to dip their bread in it and all of them decided to eat it.  the most exciting part is I made the soup yesterday and had the leftovers today...and they were even better.  The tastes all became so deep with the rosemary.  I did make this with chicken broth but since there are so many flavors I thought the broth taste would get lost.  Super recipe, doesn't take much time and a beautiful soup.","Very nice and tasty soup.Perfect for cold winter. I have used frozen spinach and vegetarian broth. Thanks.","I doubled the recipe this first time and I am so glad It is relatively easy and delicious! I have a freezer full for future cold evenings.

Thanks so much for posting.\n\nPS you don't mention garlic in the ingredients listing so I guessed about 2 cloves.","this is the best soup ever! love it love it love it. I made a couple of subs this time, vegetable stock instead of beef, tinned tomatoes instead of fresh and a handful of couscous instead of bulghar. Still lovely though, thanks for sharing","This was my first time making a soup with lentils. I was intrigued with the burghul and excited to try it. It was easy to make.  I added sliced carrots and mushrooms to the broth mixture and red, yellow, and orange peppers to the onion mixure to get more veggies in.  Love the flavor! Used 2 cloves garlic as most other users. So healthy and tasty!!! Great recipe!!","This is one of the most delicious soups I've ever had!  \r\n\r\nI did a few minor adjustments here and there, but the basic recipe.  I've saved this one.  \r\n\r\nThanks for such a delicious recipe!","Awesome! We had to substitute vegetable broth, wild rice for bulgur and no tomatoe paste due to our \"21 day cleanse\" requirements - BF added crushed red peppers - turned out perfect! (I thought it was a tad too spicy - will reduce the cayenne to 1\/8 teaspoon next time, but I'm very sensitive to spice) Great recipe! Send us more!! :)","Thank you Carol for a great recipe. As with the other reviewers I substituted vegetable broth and used 3 cloves of garlic crushed. This is the first time I've cooked anything with Bulgur and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and texture. So for those who haven't tried it before-go ahead-I bet you like it!","Very tasty recipe with a wonderful aroma. I used Better than Bouillon vegetable broth (used almost 8 cups total and let simmer longer at the end) and swapped the bulgar for barley. Used 3 cloves of minced garlic and added a generous 1\/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. Will definitely be making this again and again!","This is one of the best soups I have ever had, much less cooked. I substituted chicken stock for beef broth and was a bit heavy handed with the olive oil. Thanks!!!","Healthy and hearty soup.  I reduced the olive oil to cut down on calories, and I used chicken broth instead of beef.  Hubby and I are very happy with the result, though I must admit that I added some cumin to my bowl (cumin+lentils=perfect).  I will be making this again!","NOTE to the posting chef Carole Reu: your list of ingredients is missing the garlic! I added about 3 cloves, minced. Please correct your recipe. This was very delicious. I made it with my DIL and subbed veggie broth cause she is vegetarian. It tasted better after a day or two when the flavors mingled. Next time I might add some lamb and will also garnish with a good yogurt. It's a keeper...thanks for posting.","Deeelicious!!!  I used barley instead of bulgur (didn't have any) and had to add some extra broth.  Used McKays chicken seasoning instead of beef.  Added some garlic.  Yum!!  Definitely will make again.  Thank you for sharing!  :O)","I love this recipe and I make it all the time. Only change I make is Vegetable broth instead of beef.","I make this all the time with chicken or vegetable broth instead of beef broth. I don&#039;t even like lentils, but in this soup they taste good. Everyone I&#039;ve ever served it to has raved about it. One time I made it with buckwheat groats instead of bulgur because that&#039;s what I had. Not as good, but still tasty!

In the past I would drive over an hour to get a biscuit like this.  Thanks for the recipe!","These biscuits are so light and fluffy.  They are so yummy.  I used 2 % milk. My family loved these.  Thanks for posting this great recipe.","I had never tried makin biscuits before......I found this recipe and you would never know it. Even my great aunt (who makes biscuits all the time) commented on how tasty they were. Thanks.","came out wonderful-they are a cross between a soft roll and a biscuit!- no leftovers at all-  thanks for the great recipe","Great recipe!  If you roll it out and slather it with butter and \r\ncinnamon and sugar, then roll into a well-sealed cylinder and cut in slices - viola!  cinnamon buns ------ thank you for your recipe......bb","Came out great for Easter. I'll have to try them as ham biscuits those sound good. This is great thanks!","These biscuits turned out wonderfully which is a first for me.  Mine usually are flat and dry.  Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe!!!  They are easy to make also.  I might add just a tad bit more salt next time to enhance the flavor even more.","These are wonderful! They are so easy. I make them once a week for breakfast. I always make them the night before, letting them sit on the counter overnight. In the morning, it's very quick and easy to finish them up. They smell wonderful and my family absolutely loves them. If there are any leftovers, they are good split with butter, sugar, and cinnamon, then bake in the oven til warm and toasted.","Just tried this recipe after my mom mentioned her mom's backinthedays yeast biscuits.  These are amazing!  ABSOLUTELY amazing!!  The only difference, since i was in a rush... greediness... I set the oven to 200 and let them rise in there... and I dropped tsps of dough onto a flour pile and hand rolled lightly and added to the greased pan.  This way i did not have to knead dough. YUMMY.  The consistency is like, a biscuit with a great cake texture that holds together.  Hard to explain but delicious!!!  Just wish I had someone to share this with tonight to prove how good they are.  I only wanted a pie pan full, so I halved the recipe.  So good!!","These biscuits were a hit. Easy, EASY, EASY, and Oh so GOOD! \r\nI made Chicken Ala King and served it over the biscuitsand dinner was excellent!","I made these exactly as instructed, using soured milk.  Delicious light, layered biscuits!  I placed them about an inch apart on a very well-greased cookie sheet.  Very delicious with roast, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Made about 18 biscuits, looking forward to having leftovers for breakfasts this week!  Thanks for posting!  :~)","Foolproof, quicky, easy, light, fluffy, tender, delicious biscuits!!! This is the best recipe we have ever tried for biscuits. Everyone loves them and I have made them twice in the past two weeks. \r\nI used quick-rise yeast, and thus for the first rise only let them rise 10 minutes. Second rise, though, was a full 30. They bake up higher in the oven, too, due to the leavening agents. \r\nButtermilk makes these the best! \r\nPerfect!","So good...sometimes I don't even do the first rise.  I just fold them straight into biscuits and let them rise once before baking.","These were almost too easy to make. The dough was very easy to work with and my family loved them. Next time I may add an extra tablespoon of sugar as we do like our biscuits a bit on the sweet side. Thanks for the recipe.","I made baked about 20 of these tonight and there's only 3 left...haha! They were soo good. I didn't have regular milk so I used Almond Milk and it worked just fine. I think next time I'll roll them out to 1\" because I rolled them to about 1\/4\" and it wasn't that tall\/big, if that makes sense. They were flatter than normal biscuits. So, I think it'd be nice to state how thick to roll out otherwise newbies such as myself won't know otherwise. Overall, thanks for sharing the recipe. It's fantastic! I'll definitely be making these again.","5 stars!","I love the texture of these biscuits. So light and fluffy! Tastewise it's a tiny bit too salty for me, so I may reduce the amount of salt next time.\n\nBtw, another key to get it to rise big is to knead it VERY lightly and not overdo it. I got the tip from Alton Brown's biscuit episode. It works wonderfully!","Been looking for a good biscuit recipe. Found it! Thanks, Windchime!","At last!  No more will I bother trying to make biscuits with biscuit mix, which turns out dry crumbly rocks.  These are so easy to put together, easy to cut out and handle, and taste amazing.  I used butter because I didn't have any shortening on hand, and then brushed the tops with a little butter mixed with garlic powder and parmesan before baking, since I was serving them with spaghetti.  DD2 took one bite and said \"MMMMMMMM!!!!\"  Will definitely be making these again SOON!  Thanks!","Finally found \"The Biscuit Recipe\"!!!  They look just like the picture - light, flakey, and so delicious.  I used butter and as recommended, left sit out on the counter overnight covered by a towel.  Made the mistake of rolling some of the dough too thin, from now on, will roll about 3\/4 inch thick, because we like tall, flakey biscuits. I am going to try freezing some pre-cut dough so I can take out a few, let thaw and then cook as needed. Hopefully that should turn out really good too.","tried this recipe twice they were excellent ,tried freezing extra cut out dough turned out fine except they did not rise quite as high, however flavor and texture were spot on.anyone else who has tried freezing, let me know how they turned out for you","These are, without a doubt, the absolute best biscuits I have ever had! I don't use shortening (hydrogenated fat is evil), so I used butter. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used kefir. After cutting out the biscuits, I cut the remaining dough scraps into 1\/4\" pieces and tossed them into a pot of chicken soup. They made excellent dumplings.","Wonderful! These were easy to make and tasted great. I used butter and the milk\/vinegar option. I got 16 large fluffy biscuits that baked up perfectly. Thanks for sharing.","Loved these.","these are the best homemade yeast biscuits that I made so far, I will make sure to keep this fantastic recipe :) they are really easy and quick to make as well as sooo tasty! Thanks a lot Windchime!","This is one of the best biscuit recipes I have used.  I substituted butter for the shortening.  I used a half cup of milk, a half cup of half &amp; half, and a tablespoon of vinegar in place of buttermilk.","These biscuits do not rise at all for me! I am an accomplished baker so I know how to bake. I must be missing SOMETHING!!!","Delicious, and very easy. Set the yeast to rising, and by the time I had the shortening cut in, the yeast was ready. It is a very shaggy dough, but with the addition of about 1\/3 cup flour while kneading, it became perfectly soft and pliable. The biscuits were soft and tender. My new favorite recipe for biscuits!","These are the best yeast biscuits!  Fairly easy to make.  Messy, but they all are.  They warm up great in the oven.  They are not real bready and even warm up soft and delicious.  I cut the sugar back to 1 tbsp and they are perfect with any fillings.","I just made these today.........AND, I used my bread machine.  They came out perfect.......golden, fluffy and delicious.   I used half the amount of salt called for and didn&#039;t have shortening so I used unsalted butter slightly softened......  I set the machine on the dough setting and took out at the 50 minute mark right before the second rise........rolled the dough, cut them out, let rise for 30 minutes, brushed the tops with melted butter, baked for the 12 minutes and brushed the tops with melted butter again when they came out of the oven ........DELISH!!!!!!!!!!!    Had to have one immediately with unsalted butter and marmalade!!! Yummy :)","One of the best and easiest biscuit recipes ever! The biscuits turned out so light and fluffy. Living in a high altitude, no changes had to be made. Will be my biscuit recipe from now on.","Oh my these were good! Light and incredably flavorful. Thank you so much for a great biscuit recipe","Amazing!!! These are so good! Everyone in my family and my inlaws can't belive I made these, since they taste better than the store bought kind. It's now my go to recipe. I do recommend rolling these thick, so then they are bigger biscuits.","OMG so good I can't believe I made yeast biscuits! I should have took the pic before I ate one lol smell so good too!","Great recipe. My biscuits usually be hard, tasteless &amp; dry. These were soft, tasty&amp; beautifully tanned in color. Thanks. I may get married again.","SO EASY TO VEGANIZE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used 1 cup soy milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar in lieu of the buttermilk and they were SO FLUFFY AND tasty!! Sometimes texture comes at the cost of taste, but these have BOTH the desired texture and taste. I was also making sweet potato fries so I allowed the dough to rise for about 2 hours the first time and then probably an hour after being cut. I always heat my oven to 40 degrees above the cooking temperature and then turn it to the baking temperature when I insert the baked goods because an oven will lose 30-40 degrees when we open the oven. So I do not know how any of these impacted the biscuits but these knocked the socks off my family and will now be the cholesterol free family favorite!! Thanks for sharing!","I halved the recipe easily! Really easy and great recipe!","I love these! So easy to make and so good to eat. I make these all the time. I know it's not heart healthy but I like to use lard when I have it. Makes them turn out just like those Grand Biscuits.","Here I am at 4 a.m. making biscuits. I mean, did you forget that it's Sunday or something? Come for breakfast...","I was a little worried when these biscuits didn't rise as much to my liking prior to baking, but they came out perfect, and the flavor was divine. So homey....so old school. Had them slathered with butter and with chicken pot pie, in the crock pot without the crust. I will definitely keep this recipe and use it often.

I added extra jalepenos to give it a little more kick.","Good stuff!! We have made several batches and I gave the recipe to my parents who love it also. I didn't skim much before jarring, I wanted as many of the peppers in the jelly as possible. I turned the jars occassionally as they cooled to help distribute the peppers throughout the jar. What a wonderful sweet\/hot flavor on toast! Thank you so much.","This is so beautiful - will be making more for gifts, and more for me!  This is actually the first jelly I've ever made and it came out wonderfully.  I used serrano peppers instead of jalapeno, and cranberry-raspberry juice instead of just cranberry juice (it's what I had on-hand), and will probably use more peppers next time.  Hoping this will become a family favorite - can't wait 'til this Thursday (Thanksgiving) to share it with the kids.  Thanks!","Looks like you may have been one of the first members on Zaar, but it seems you aren't here anymore. Anyway this was something a little different from your ordinary hot pepper jelly. Love the colour using the cranberry juice- I used cran-raspberry as that was what I had. Also added a couple of cloves of garlic when I was processing the peppers, and added a couple of red chili peppers from the garden for added colour. I don't bother putting jellies in a water bath and they sealed just fine. Just remember to rotate the jars as they're cooling to distribute the solids. A lovely addition to my store of preserves- thanks!","This is a great recipe, love the color and taste.  I added more peppers and some garlic after the first batch(it was a little mild for my taste). Turned out great and I am planning on sharing this recipe with a great many others!!!","This is my favorite hot pepper jelly! (so far)\r\n\r\nI add 3 habeneros to heat it up to where I like it.  I've used Ocean Spray cranberry juice cocktail a couple times and don't get as nice a color as when I've used store brand juice.

I think I need to buy some more peppers and make more.  Thanks for a great new jelly.","Followed directions but found there was not enough zip (hot pepper) flavor throughout. Was dissappointed because it sure sounded great. I think I would add alot more chopped jalapeno, 1 to 1 1\/2 C,  next time. This was very mild jelly.","OMG!!! TEN stars for the directions alone.  I've tried to make jelly numerous times with no luck - just did not set up even after weeks of sitting on the shelves.  I followed these directions to the letter right down to timing the minutes for boiling and it came out perfect.  I think the flavor will develop more bite as it sits so I'm eager to see that.  After reading other reviewers I did add some of the seeds to the mixture to get that extra bite that my family loves.  Served over cream cheese with crackers on the side and so yummy.  I'm addicted to, but think it'll be even better with age.  If i can find some small jelly jars I think this will be perfect in my gift baskets this year.  Thinking of even putting names on the jar and using them as place cards around my Thanksgiving table.  Thanks Carole for one great jelly recipe.  Made for Tagging Pink -09","This was very good jelly, the cranberry juice adds a little tang to the sweet and heat, I also added garlic. I love garlic in everything and it made it awesome good. I recommend that you use 2 pectins instead of one. It is very runny, not jelly like at all. It will be ok for marinades and mixing with things but to put on toast, crackers or cream cheese it is like water. So try this recipe it really is good just use two pectins and you will love it.","Beautiful and absolutely stunning.  Yes, two packs of pectin is recommended.  My first batch I made exactly to the recipe, everyone loved it and I had to give my first batch away.  Second batch I kicked up the heat with more peppers, but that overpowered the cranberry flavor that makes this so special.  Hotter was not necessarily better.  I will stick to the original recipe but use 2 pectins.","Have to give this a 5 just for the easy part alone. I added 2 pouches of liquid pectin like others recommended and I added extra jalapeno's. Oh and I also added a few drops red food coloring because the juice didn't quite make it red enough. I used Ocean Spray cranberry juice. It looks beautiful. I maybe only used 1 extra jalapeno over half cup so I hope it tastes great as I didn't taste test if while making it.","This is great everyone loves it!!! I'm making two more batches..I did use two packets of the liquid fruit pectin, after reading the reviews, and also used 1-1\/2 cups of jalapenos and left the seeds in 10 of them, it has a bite but I think I would like it a little hotter. Thank you for sharing this recipe its great:)Judy","I also use two packets of pectin; this stuff is awesome. We've used it in place of grape jelly in the standard coctail weiner recipe - cranberry jalapeno jelly, cocktail sauce and lil' smokies. It's super easy and always goes over very well.  Thanks for the recipe!","This is a terrific recipe. I'll admit I added to it a little. First off I increased the Jalapenos to a cup and added 3\/4 cup of whole fresh frozen cranberries and the juice of one lemon with a teaspoon of zest. I chopped the cranberries up with the chili's in the food processor. The rest of the recipe stayed the same. I did a double batch it turned out great. Everyone loves it and it is deffinately a do over. Thanks for all the hints, they did help.","Fabulous!! I have made this twice this week with fresh jalapenos from the garden. It was so good the first time that I decided to make more as gifts. I used 2 packages of pectin the second time and found that it set too fast to even get in the jars. This recipe is a keeper but I will be making it with the amount of pectin called for and a few extra jalapenos.","Made some a couple of days ago and it turned out great. I did use two packs of pectin, I also added some red chili peppers, and used a half cup of cider vineger and a half cup of white instead of 1 whole cup of white and I thought the color was a little to pink for me too so I added red food coloring.","This was easy and good. What more could you want. I doubled the peppers and still found the jelly to be mild enough for my friends to eat. Thank You for posting!","Easy to make and tastes great!","Awesome! Being from New Orleans, I like things SPICY! I&#039;ve tried several other Pepper Jelly recipes and have always been disappointed because it&#039;s always been runny and lacking in flavor (even the Tabasco brand is a bit bland). I used 2 cups chopped jalapenos, generic cranberry juice, 2 pouches of Certo, and 3 drops red food coloring. Beautiful color, flavor that is outta this world! While it did set fast (I wish I could use 1 1\/2 pouches instead of 2) it is a nice &quot;jelly&quot; consistency - other recipes have always been too runny.

Thanks for sharing!","I had a package of lemon supreme cake mix that I needed to use up, so I replaced the lemon jello with unflavored.  I also had an 8-oz. carton of soymilk that was about to expire, so I used that instead of the water, and cut back a bit on the oil.  I had more liquid in there than the recipe called for, so I thought it should have mixed up easily, but it didn't really; I had quite a few \"chunks\" of cake mix left in the batter bowl!  It didn't affect the taste or texture, though; it had a subtle lemon flavor.  I skipped the icing, because I went to the supermarket to buy lemons... and forgot to buy lemons!  But this was a lovely and simple cake, nonetheless.  Thanks for posting.","Yummy! Calorie deadly.\nThanks for posting it!","Can't believe how delicious this cake turned out with so little effort.

His classmates came up to me a few days later when I was there to help with something and told me how much they loved it. One even asked for the recipe for her mom. I'm here today because that son is about to have his 30th birthday and I needed to find a copy of the recipe. So glad it's here and looks exactly like I remember it. Side note though--I tried to decorate the cake a little for his birthday one year. I tinted the glaze with blue food coloring. Big mistake! Blue food coloring on a yellow cake looks green.

I did leave out the olives, but made everything else the same and got a guacamole that was praised by all that tried it.","I have made this a few times and always get great reviews. My avocado picking skills need some honing though;) I omit the black olives, and instead of the fresh tomatoes, I just add another tablespoon of Salsa. This recipe definately makes me look like a great cook:) thanks!!","This was a delicious guacamole recipe.  I used my blender to help mush up the avocado and sour cream together, then placed in a bowl with the diced avocado and folded in the rest of the ingredients with a rubber spatula.  \r\nI served this with Mini Tacos <a href=\"\/74301\">Mini Tacos<\/a> and we ate every drop!  Thanks for the easy recipe.","Excellent recipe, easy, quick and very versatile, not to mention very tasty! Can be made vegan by taking out the sour cream.","Made this with Nimrod Cook's Mexican Snack Stacks #182091. This very easy. I omitted the cilantro. I didn't have any, otherwise I follow the recipe to a T. I also used lemon juice. Thanks maenad for sharing you recipe.","YUM!!! Thank you for sharing this simply, yet delicious recipe. \r\n\r\nMy son, who unlike my other 3 kids usually thoroughly dislikes avocado, ate this without a second thought and even asked if he can help make it next time.","I love this recipe!!! I have made it 2x in one week. I left out parsley and didnt have olives, but other than that I followed recipe exactly. My picky 2yr old and mother who hates quacamole ate it all up. Thanks for a great recipe!","Really enjoyed this recipe. It went over very well at the Christmas Party. Thanks","This is GREAT!  I love it and make it often!  I have always stayed away from guacamole, I though that it would be nasty b\/c of the color.  Boy was I wrong!  My very pregnant sister in law craves this, so I made her some for her baby shower.  It was a hit, I had to run to the store when it was over to make some more for her to bring home.  My batch was adjusted to serve 12 people and it still was the first thing to go.  Thanks a lot!","Oh my goodness!!! This is by far the best Guacamole I have ever eaten in my life. I quadrupuled the recipe and am glad that I did because one would just not have been enough know my bottomless pit of a stomach. :) Thank you sooo much for this wonderful recipe. It doesn't get much better then that.","Thanks! Great recipe. Very yummy!","This was very tasty but we added a few drops of Chilli oil to give it a bit of a kick.","This recipe was easy to do.  5 stars might be a bit much, maybe 4-1\/2 would be better.  It lacked a bit of flavor for me.  I'm used to a guacamole with zest.  I didn't use the olives, but did use fresh lime.  I will keep this recipe for the basics, but think next time to use a spicy salsa to kick it up.","Really enjoyed this. Very quick, very simple. I used some red pesto instead of salsa and creme fraiche instead of our cream. Turned out really nice. Black olives are definitely essential to the taste.\n\nHad it with spicy home made sweet potato wedges and some Baklava Salmon (salmon with honey, mustard and walnuts)\n\nReally went down a treat :)","I used this recipe last night but felt it needed something so I added a little sugar and chili powder and its great now!  I also added medium salsa which kicked it up a notch!!!  I did not add the black olives though.","This was the best guacamole we've ever had!  Thank you for the recipe - we'll be making it again and again!","loved it ... yummy!! It's a good thing that we had guests over to share it with us or else me and the hubby would have eaten all of it!!!  MMMMMMMMM","This was my first time making guac...and it was a huge hit at our bbq!!!  I left out the olives (my DH and I don't eat them) and forgot to put in the onion.  I also used \"light\" sour cream as well...and it was still delicious.  I could eat this stuff all day long!!!  Yum.","Loved this recipe!  I used cilantro and lime juice and left out the olives.  I used about 1\/2 tsp salt for one avocado.  The flavor was perfect with our fajitas.  Thanks!","awesome recipe, i loved the overall flavor and will make this again.  Thank you!","I make guacamole all the time and this is the best yet!","Great! I left out the olives and added lemon pepper. It was a nice creamy consistency and a hit with the party!","Lovely!","Yummy!! The only thing I did different is I added roasted garlic to the recipe.  Delicious!!","Woohoo!  Finally found one that I like.  Maybe even too much because I ate the whole thing.  I didn't have black olives, but everything else was perfect.  This will be the only one I make from now on.  Thank!","Without a doubt the best I've ever tried!Ileft out the black olive, used low fat sour cream and dried parsley.Sinfull!!!!!","This was good.  DD and I made this for us when we were having tacos for dinner.  I left out the cilantro as DD doesn't care for it otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Thank you for a good guac recipe.....Stephanie","Yet another 5 Star review.  I made it without the cilantro or parsley, for no other reason than you said it might be vile.  I don't want vile guacamole.  :-)","Great recipe. I brought it to work and everyone loved it!","Wow! I served this for Christmas and everyone asked for the recipe. What a delicious guacamole!","Good basic dip.  Followed the directions, except for the black olives and lemon juice.  Test tasted it and found that the flavor needed to be kicked up a few notches.  I added some chili powder, more onions and tomatoes and more sour cream to give a creamer texture.  I also added some salt.  The flavors really need to blend and the best way to keep the guacamole from turning brown is to add the pit into the dip. You won't need to add the lemon juice or lime juice if you add the pit and then remove it before serving.","I doubled this recipe, I know it will disappear. I made this for our t.v. night at home.  I added some sun dried tomato spread and black olive tapenade.  I divided the lemon and lime juice and balsamic vinegar and used all three.  I didn't put any salt in this at all, don't think I needed it because there was some in the sun dried tomato spread and the olive tapenade.  The flavour of this is really good.  I can't wait until later and scoop it onto my tortilla chip.  Thanks for a great post.","VERY EASY to make. Works great in a large batch also. I tripled the recipe and left out the sour cream and olives because I didn't have them on hand. I also used minced garlic instead of pressed.\r\nI will definately use this recipe again and never again will I buy guacamole!!!","We loved this! I didn't have any black olives and would only have been able to put them on mine anyway. Also I didn't have any fresh cilantro or parsley. I can't find fresh cilantro in my area, so used dried and it worked fine. This was just about the right amount for dinner. Thanks for a great recipe! I will make this again (I have another avocado in the fridge)!","Fantastic guacamole recipe!  I doubled the lime juice and added quite a bit more cilantro.  This was devoured!  Thanks maenad!","This was my first time making guac. I added 6 jalapeno slices, finely chopped and a bit more cilantro. I'm going to keep looking for my favorite guac recipe, but this was an good first start.","I amalgamated this recipe with another on Zaar by adding 1\/8 tsp cumin and 1\/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  The result- all time best guac recipe!!","I made this last night and I love it!! I didnt use olives but the rest was great!!!","This deserves 10 stars if it could!  My first time making guacamole and it was delish!  I had three med avocados so adjusted the ingredients accordingly, also did not have olives on hand.  Thank you SO much for posting :)","SOOOO GOOD!!  I love it!! I didn't add any cilantro (I am one of those people that find it vile)  I added my own home made salsa and this came out delicious.  This is a keeper! The sour cream just makes it so nice and smooth.  Thanks","This was very good!! Will make it again. I too left out the cilantro.","Really good.  Very similar to my own recipe but I wanted some measurements to go by.  I didn't add cilantro (find it vile.) or the black olives (also vile.) and instead of the tomato and salsa, I added 2 tbsp of tomatoes with green chilies which gave it a nice heat.  Very tasty, and it yields quite a bit (nice to stretch out those expensive avocados). Thank you!","great recipe- free form is the best when it comes to guacamole! We served this in our fajitas and it was delicious!","Terrific- Dh and I are loving it.  I left out the salsa and olives.  I used white onion.  I used lemon juice and 1\/2 tsp. of salt .  YUM!","My fiance and I have made this several times now. This is the best guacamole we have ever had! We will never buy the pre-packaged again. Even our favorite mexican restaraunt doesn't compare to this. Thanks :)","Made this for a family golf tournament. Omitted the onions as I did not have any on hand. It was a big hit. Made 5 times the amount for 14 & it disappeared quickly before dinner was served. Thank You.","Very good, my new favorite guac. I omitted the cilantro because there are many of my guests that feel it is vile, and I omitted the olives, because I think that might be weird in a guacamole. Otherwise...very tasty. Thanks for posting.","Wonderful!! I made ours without the onion and olives bcuz we don't like that here. But it was EXCELLENT! Thank you.","I'm not a fan of guac, but my BF is and he really raved about this guacamole.  I omitted the sour cream.  Glad to know that whenever I have some extra avocado this recipe can put it to good use.  (UPDATE: I am converted.  I love this stuff and it is a must whenever we have tacos.  The canned guac they serve at restaurants is toxic waste by comparison.)","This is fantastic! I would have never thought to add black olives to guacamole, but it really gives it pizazz. The only thing I changed was to substitute sour cream with plain non-fat yogurt for a healthier option.    I also used both lime and lemon juice instead of one or the other.","made this heaps of times, keep forgetting to review! here it is, a review! its brilliant, try it!","This was excellent!\r\nMade it last night with hubby. I love the addition of the sour cream.  We were a little bit more generous with the tomatoe, onion and salsa... it's very hard to do just 1Tablespoon of those items.  Also we used FRESH salsa.  You could smell the yummy freshness of it all! Hubby added a couple dashes of Old Bay and it was tasty!","This is so good, I have made it weekly this summer! The sour cream makes it smooth and the salsa gives it a little zip. I prefer mine with added salt.","This is an absolutely wonderful recipe.  Even those in my household that don't like guacamole love it!  I make this recipe at least once a week and even doubling it, there are no leftovers.  Yummylicious!","This the best guacamole I've ever made!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  I doubled the recipe, and there was not one little bit left.  Fabulous!  Thank you maenad!","I loved the sour cream.  I followed the chef's advice and let my guacamole be free-form.  I added extra garlic and omitted the black olives, just because I didn't want to open a whole can for a couple of olives.  Great recipe.  I will definitely be buying more avocados for this FANTASTIC recipe.  THANK YOU!!","absolutely delish. love the addition of black olives. i add a touch of sweet chili sauce too, the second time i made this. so versatile!","Didn't make this exactly as written - free-form and all.  It seemed to be a little bland as we made it, but as the avocados we had (the great big huge ones) pretty tasteless, so that probably didn't help.  Next time we'll use a different kind.  I don't care for black olives, so skipped that - but might use green next time.  We used some fresh pico de gallo that we'd made, which was nice.  Also will definitely use some extra garlic.  The sour cream adds a different dimension to it - great for a spread on BLTs or for homemade chips.  Thanks!","Very good guacamole.  I didn't have olives but added salsa verde.  Great with our Mexican Cobb Salad.","Delicious! I didn't add olives because I am the only in my family that likes them.  Will be making this often!","Awesome recipe! I minced the garlic, instead of pressing and was only estimating quantities, and it was fabulous! I also omitted black olives, just because I don't like them. Really easy and quick, too!","This guacamole is so good.  A lot of ingredients but so worth it.  Thanks maenad :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game","Ding Ding Ding Ding..we have a winner folks!  DH loved it (think the sour cream won him over!)  I didn&#039;t have everything on the list, so i subbed mild taco sauce for salsa, left out olives, cilantro because i had none on hand...as well as the onion (cos DH doesn&#039;t like raw onion).  He has already requested I make it again.  Thank you!","I've used a similar recipe for a long time, learned it in Albuquerque, but I add about half a can of diced green chiles and leave out the olives.","This is the best Guacamole I have ever had. I used 3 avocados instead of 1. Here is a way to make it healthier! I used 2 tablespoons of key lime Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Also saved time and used 3 spoons of chunky fresh sweet onion salsa. Added garlic salt and a few drops of concentrated lemon juice. You can alter yogurt\/salsa and garlic to your taste.

After rinsing the berries, I ran them through my juicer (without cooking them).  I then followed the recipe using the three cups of juice. I was told by a county extension agent that I would still have to strain the juice through a jelly bag.  I did for part of the batches, but got lazy for the rest and used the juice straight from the juicer.  They both set up perfectly and I couldn't tell the difference in taste.  I put some in pint jars. Those jars took about two weeks to completely set up. The smaller jars set up more quickly.  The bottle of liquid pectin is equal to two pouches if you buy it that way.","Easy & yummy recipe. I didn't have liquid pectin so I ended up using powdered with only 4 1\/2 cups sugar (per the package), but super yummy anyway! With all the mulberry trees we have, I'm sure I'll be making lots of this in the future.","Wow!  Delicious!   I used Ball Low or No Sugar needed pectin which converts to 6 tbsp for this recipe.  Also just used the whole berry (did not strain).  My berries were on the small side and ranged from ripe to pink.  All used together makes for a very pleasing jam.  Thanks for sharing.","This is very tasty, but it is not a jam recipe, it is a jelly recipe.  Jams are made with the crushed fruit and jellies are made with just the strained juice.  If it had been posted as a jelly recipe, I would have given it five stars.","Lovely Jelly! I did not get enough Mulberries from my very young and small tree this summer, so I used some Black Raspberries and Red Currents to make up the difference. It is a beautiful deep burgundy-purple and set up perfectly overnight. I used two packets of liquid pectin as another reviewer suggested. Ended up with 7 half pints and one quarter pint. Wonderful way to showcase all the local berries that grow around here! I will definitely make this every year, but hopefully just with Mulberries next time, to get a real taste of them on their own.","Without even trying the recipe, I see two problems with it.  One, straining the berries and using the juice makes it a jelly not a jam.  Two, open kettle method of making jam and jelly is outdated and dangerous.  You should always process the jars after canning.","Made this with powdered pectin (added pectin first to juice, then boiled, then added sugar\/lemon juice and boiled the 1 minute). Soooo good! Moved to a home with a mulberry tree last year, and now have a way to use them all. First batch I made is small, but if I make a big batch, will be canning the proper way.","I did exactly was written and the same thing happened as last year it didn't set","This is good proportions the only problem is this is far from a jam you're reducing the fruit from the mixture and using just the juice and calling this a jam so I can't write this as a good mulberry jam because it's not really a jam"],"vegetarian":"Y","pescetarian":"Y","vegan":"Y","lactose intolerant":"Y","gluten free":"Y","peanut allergy":"Y","kosher":"Y","halal":"Y"},{"id":2772,"name":"mushroom pot roast","minutes":95,"ingredient_ids":[626,2683,5006,5010,7655,4053,2451,3184,2430,4585,6183,7168,7812,2847,7917],"ingredients":["blade pot roast","flour","olive oil","onions","water","ketchup","dry sherry","garlic","dry mustard","marjoram","rosemary","thyme","whole bay leaf","fresh mushrooms","wide egg noodles"],"steps":["coat meat with flour","in a dutch oven , brown meat on both sides in 2 tablespoons olive oil","season with salt and pepper","add 2 cups of sliced onion","combine 1 \/ 4 cup each of water and ketchup , 1 \/ 3 cup dry sherry , 1 large clove garlic , minced , 1 \/ 4 teaspoon each of dry mustard , marjoram , crushed rosemary , thyme and 1 medium whole bay leaf","add to pot , simmer covered for 2 hours or until tender","remove meat to platter","discard bay leaf","add 1 \/ 4 lb","fresh mushrooms","blend 1 \/ 4 cup cold water with 2 tablespoons flour","stir into juices","cook and stir until thickened and bubbly","pour gravy over roast and use the rest for wide egg noodles you have cooked and drained","i usually double the gravy"],"description":"a delicious and simple roast recipe with a very tasty gravy.","calorie_level":0,"avg_rating":4.4285714286,"review":["This was the best roast I have ever eaten.

The gravy is really incredible, and like another person posted doubling the gravy is recommended.  The gravy is a HUGE hit!  Next time I would use the smallest mushrooms I could find, or add a few more, but we're mushroom fiends.  I did do a variation though.

The gravy is very tasty and the meat nice and tender, however, the gravy was too sweet for our tastes.  I should have realized that when adding the ketchup and sherry.  I would still recommend this recipe.","This was very tasty.  My hubby loved it!  I \"cheated\" and used a packet of dried onion soup instead of the fresh onions.  I omited the ketchup and used white wine since I didn't have any sherry.  Delicious gravy! I made this in my crock-pot and added a few peeled carrots toward the end.  I served it over mashed potatoes. Thank you, Julesong, for a great dinner!","Absolutely delicious! I used sliced mushrooms and didn't bother to thicken the gravy, it was more of a thick mushroom-onion sauce that was wonderful served over the roast. Tender, flavorful and easy. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!","We LOVED this. I was worried about it being too sweet so I added 2 Cups of Beef Broth while it cooked. + Amazing +","I got this recipe out of one of my junior league cookbooks and I am so glad to see it posted here.  The flavor of the pot roast is just wonderful!  I used a boneless chuck roast.  I didn't thicken up the gravy as it was plenty thick on its own.  The recipe is easy to make and one that I will be making often.  Thanks for posting!","This was outstanding! Being a cheap Bohemian, I used canned mushrooms and it was great.

I made baked potatoes to go with it and we ended up putting the gravy on the potatoes too. Which was even more awesome. This is my new pot roast recipe.","WOW! This is the first time I've ever made pot roast, and I am glad to have found this recipe. I followed the instructions precisely and it was great!   I served this with egg noodles, and corn on the side.  Even the kids loved it. Thank you for sharing.  This one will be added on our bi-weekly plan.","A great way to fix pot roast!   The gravy was everything you said it was.   I added about 1\/2 of a 14 oz can of beef broth to give it more liquid to simmer in.  this made plenty of broth for gravy.  We'll be making this again.","Absolutely delicious and great for the whole family! The meat was soo tender and the gravy was seasoned to perfection. \nI followed the recipe except for three tasty diversions:\n1. Used beef stew meat (cubed)\n2. Whole peeled pearl onions + a shallot instead of 2 c onion, and\n3. Mashed potatoes for starch instead of egg noodles. \nEveryone said to double the gravy, so I did, and the extra liquid helped carry it through the two hour cook time nicely. Also, made enough gravy for the potatoes. \nIdea! Try adding baby potatoes and carrots to the beef & onions to make a savory stew.","This was my first Roast (I'm learning how to cook!). I made it in a crockpot and did not use the Marjoram or Rosemary becuse I didn't have any. MY DH loved it and that says alot becuse he is picky. Super easy recipe for first timers!","I haven't finished cooking this one, but the aroma alone is soooo yummy that I know that it'll be fantastic!","Very nice flavors... I used a white whine didn't have Sherry.","This was SO good!  My entire family loved it...even the 4 year old.  I did make more of the gravy for use on our mashed potatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  I highly recommend this recipe!","This is a fantastic recipe.  The flavors are rich and very good.  The meat comes out incredibly tender.  I used a 4 pound chuck roast and it was absolutely lovely.

Crockpots are a life saver!","I was SO looking forward to using this recipe for weeks and I'm sorry, I've never given anything such a low rating, and hate doing it, but this did not turn out the way I expected it to.  I followed the directions to a \"T,\" and the chicken came out dry with no liquid to make a \"gravy\" out of.  Why I'm giving it two stars as opposed to one, is that I was able to salvage some of the chicken breasts adding teryaki sauce and \"steaming\" in the microwave with a few TBs of water, used the rice I had made and served chicken tacos AND the fact that I live in Arizona and the hot weather we're having may have played into it drying out.  I don't know... maybe as recipes for crock pots are posted, the fact that an oval or round crock pot is being used would be beneficial.","This tasted bland to us. We also discovered that we are not big fans of chicken breasts in the crock pot. They dry out and fall apart.","I substituted skinned and boned thighs, as I do with all crock pot recipes, because they come out much more moist than do breasts. I also reduced the cooking time to five hours which helped to keep the meat moist.","My family loved this chicken, I used thighs instead, quite moist.  We made rice bowls instead, and I didn't add the oranges and coconut at the end...enjoy","I feel bad giving this such a low rating, but I want to warn others considering it.  Chicken that has cooked for hours in orange juice concentrate is not only dried out but just does not taste good.  The combination of flavors in the ingredients sounds good, but there needs to be a lot of alterations to get the final dish to taste good.","We thought this dish was very tasty and very easy to put together.  It also looked beautiful when plated - I wish we had taken a picture - I will the next time I make this.  I think the problem some others may have had was the size of the pieces of chicken.  I used very large boneless, skinless breasts (11 ozs each) and bone-in thighs.  If you use the small 6-8 oz breast, they will definitely be dried out.

I haven't had it at Outback -- but I would now after making it at home!  This recipe has been given to a few friends also.","Molly, what a fantastic soup! I made this for dinner tonight for DH and DS, they both raved over it. I doubled the recipe, used homemade chicken broth, and only used 3 cups onions instead of 4 cups. I did not double the white sauce, only the soup ingredients. Served it with crusty buns. This soup is a meal in itself, very filling and very delicious! thanks for posting Molly, we enjoyed it very much!...Kittencal:)","This is wonderful!","I must've tried 4 or 5 recipes trying to duplicate the Outback Aussie Cheese soup and FINALLY....your's was the charm.  Absolutely love it..great taste, easy prep...couldn't ask for more!","I made this for my parents when they came to visit and my dad, an onion soup afficianado said, \"It wasn't bad.\" (high praise) I made one change out of necessity -- I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth and I left out most of the salt.  I did double batch  but it wasn't enough for everyone.  Next time I make this for more than two people I'll have to quadruple the recipe.","This soup was so good.  I'm not a fan of onions but i loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Will make again and again","I was looking for something a little different and thought I'd give this a try as I actually had some velveeta cheese on hand. This was a smooth and delightful soup- very cheesy. I used a sweet vidalia onion. Thanks Molly for a great addition to my soup cookbook :-).","I've tried making this soup from another site, but I was very disappointed from how it turned out. I made it tonight and it's already gone!! I also could not believe how impossibly easy it was to make!! My family LOVED it!!!!","Everyone love the taste but I made it twice making the last time with less salt and I still got complaints on too salty. Any suguestions please?..my husband loves this soup.Thank you.","My son and I liked the soup, but it tasted somewhat different from Outback's and we were looking for more of an exact match. It is quite good though.","After finding about 3 different popular recipes for Outback's delicious Creamy Onion Soup (a.k.a. Walkabout Onion Soup), I decided to go with this one.  Am I'm glad I did!  \n\nI made this for my wife and me, and we both loved it.  Taste-wise, it is pretty much identical, best I could tell (and I've eaten this soup at Outback quite a bit).  Texture-wise, it was slightly thinner, and slightly greasier -- but not enough to make a difference.  I was more concerned with taste than texture, and in that regard, it exceeded expectations.\n\nAnother note, I added a bit of sage, per comments from another review of another recipe (by an ex-Outback employee).  I think this made a difference, and possibly made it more like the original.  I also added a third oz. of Velveeta.  Lastly, while the ingredients call for 2 tbsp. of butter, the instructions call for 3 -- I went with 3, which may have been why it was a tad greasier.\n\nThanks, Molly, for the great recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again, and for a bigger party!","Great soup! Don't think I've ever had the Outback version, but we enjoyed this. I had to sub regular cheese for Velveeta since what we had in the fridge was hard and dry! But delicious nonetheless! I also left out all the salt since I thought it would be too much with the bouillon cubes. (I subbed cubes with water for the broth.) Also used skim milk since that's all we keep around here! Edited to add: Wow, guess I underestimated how much DH loved this soup...he just finished the leftovers and wanted me to make it again yesterday!","The first time I made this is was WAYYY too salty, and I didn't add the salt due to previous reviews stating it was too salty.  This recipe is delicious and so close to outbacks besides the fact that outbacks was much creamier than this.  I used low sodium chicken broth(safeway brand's has less sodium than Swanson's low sodium), and a lower sodium chicken boullion that came in a packet..I can't remember what it's called it has the word herbal in it.  That didn't make a too delicious flavor though so I added one chicken boullion cube without any water to match it.   I have made this recipe twice in the last week, it is delicious!  Everyone loves it and can't have just one bowl.  For more than 3 full bowls, I recommend doubling the recipe.","This soup is delicious and tastes alot like the real thing.  My husband really loved it!  I doubled the recipe, but followed the ingredients exactly.  So yummy!  Thanks!","This was an excellent recipe.   We thought it tasted the same as the original.  Based on several other reviews I did not add the salt to the soup or the white sauce and it was perfect.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!","I was looking around for an Onion Soup recipe....and wound up with this one...\n\nGreat find!  Wonderful recipe.","This soup is very close to Outbacks! They have not been serving it lately at the location closest to me so I decided to try myself. This recipe is quick, delicious, and EASY. Thank you!!!!!","This soup is wonderful, it was quick and easy to prepare and all my dinner guests enjoyed it. I served it with Beer Bread #73440 and it went wonderfully together. I made it just as written and I wouldn't change a thing","Very good onion soup. It was a pleasent change from the traditional onion soup. Will make this again.","Wow!  The Outback in my area stopped offering this on their menu :(  I was so bummed, as this was one of my absolute favorite soups.  Thank you so much for your submission of this recipe!!!  It was AWESOME!  I will be making this again and again.  The only thing I didn't do was add salt.  I thought the bouillon would take care of that for me, and it did!  Thanks again for the post!!","really good soup.  read reviews before i made it so i used a little extra flour in the roux and cut back on the salt and the soup was perfect.  also gently rewarmed white sauce and melted cheese in it before adding to onion\/broth mixture.","This is one of my MOST favorite soup recipes.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls and sometimes it comes out thicker than others, but it is ALWAYS so tasty.  This one will stay in my book forever!","I reduced the salt by using fewer bouillon cubes and not adding the salt.  I also reduced the liquid a bit to make a slightly thicker soup.  The taste was amazing and will definitely be something I make again. Thanks for a great recipe!","My favorite soup on the face of the planet! My Dad makes this for my family and we LOVE IT! I follow the recipe to the T and it comes out perfect every time. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the original from Outback. Honestly, I believe this recipe is more flavorful than the original. Thanks a million for the recipe! My life is now complete! :)","Thank you for this recipe, my family absolutely loved it!!  I ended up using thick shredded chedder as a sub for the velveeta and dropped in some caesar croutons at the end instead of the bread for the kids and it was a major hit!  I will make this for years to come... thanks! I must say this is one of the best soups I've ever made","LOVED IT!!!! \nI substituted the velveeta cheese with a slice of american cheese and a slice of swiss cheese... \ninstead of whole milk I used evaporated milk, it made it sooooo creamy!\nI also used low sodium beef broth instead of chicken broth.\nI also skipped the bouillon cubes, didn't feel the need for them. And I'm really glad I didn't, it was perfect and creamy with out them. \nWith these adjustments, It was not too salty at all!","I used stephtrosclair's tip and used evaporated milk. I threw in three thin slices of american cheese in addition to the Velveeta. and steemed three ears of fresh sweetcorn, sliced off the kernels, and threw them in too. It was increadible. My new favorite soup. (I guess, technically, it has become a chowder).","Oooooh YUM!  This is really delicious.  I am so glad to be able to satisfy the craving for the Outback soup in my own kitchen!  I followed the recipe exactly and was thrilled with the results!  Total happiness!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.","This is EXACTLY the soup the Outback used to serve.  Be careful with the salt, though.  Because of the broth and bullion, you'll want to taste it before adding more salt.","Very tasty soup!  I've never had this at Outback but am sooo glad I found it here.  I lightened it up by using 1% milk and just two slices of Velveeta and a slice of butter cheese.  I didn't add salt and didn't miss it.  I'll make this again and again!","We just had Walkabout Soup at Outback 2 days ago. I wanted to make this recipe soon after, so the taste would be fresh in my mind. This IS it! It was exactly right. I followed the recipe exactly, making no changes. It was very easy to do, even on a weeknight after work. Next time I will not add any extra salt - it wasn't too salty, but it was close. I might add a little white wine or sherry. Thanks for a great recipe that I will make often.","WOW- this is it.  I loooooove the Walkabout Soup and this is it.   I made it exactly as directed, except I used 2% milk.  Don't give up on your white sauce, it took mine just a bit to thicken.  I can't rave enough about this recipe.  Can't wait to make it with Vidalia onions.","THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!  When we go to Outback Steakhouse, I always order this soup. It's the best I've had ever. I never thought I would find a recipe to make it!! We just finished making t is EXACTLLY the same as the walkabout soup at Outback! I would like to say to anyone making this, follow the directions when it comes to the white sauce. I raised the recipe up to 6 servings. After adding the whole milk slowly, it took about 10 minutes to become a pudding consistency. So don't get impatient with it, it WILL thicken :) We are just ecstatic right now on how great this turned out! Again, Thank you Thank you Thank you!!","Made this for my sick wife who said Walkabout Soup sounded really good. She Loved It! She wants me to make it for the next dinner party we have. I used yellow American slices instead of Velvieta because I didn't have any. I think it worked well.","Couldn't get any closer... WONDERFUL.....","Awesome soup!  Tastes just like Outback's!","While this was quite tasty it is nothing like the French Onion soup that is served at Outback! It is more like a creamy potato soup of sorts!","Two words: TOO SALTY! Other than that, this recipe was the closest recipe I've seen to the actual soup. The first time I made it, I did exactly what the recipe said. It was way too salty for my boyfriend and my taste and had too many onions. The second time around, I added less than one tsp of the chicken bubillion and no salt until after I had tasted the final product. I'm not a big onion fan, but I do appreciate the flavor they can give a dish. I chopped up only about a 1\/4-1\/2 a cup of onion and that was muuuch better. Also, I boiled some bite sized pieces of potato and threw those in too because the Outback in my area has potatoes in there. <br\/><br\/>Overall, the recipe was great and I will definitely be using it for years :)","This is unbelievable!!!!!! Velveeta is the key!! Thank you!!!","I have never made a creamy onion soup, but I thoroughly enjoyed this Outback Creamy Soup.<br\/>The flavor of the soup was delightful.  The only thing I found, was it was just a bit too thick for my liking, so added and additional cup of chicken broth.<br\/>The Velveeta cheese really made a big difference.<br\/>Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.<br\/>Regards,<br\/>\"Uncle Bill\"","Can make the white sauce in a large pyrex measuring cup in the microwave.  It will thicken faster that way and you don't have to worry about it sticking.  You do need to make sure it doesn't boil over though.  Will make the recipe even easier!","We order this every time we go to Outback if it's available. Since we have to drive at least 1 1\/2 hours to the nearest Outback we don't get there too often so I was very happy to find this recipe. I recently fixed it for my wife's family and we all agree that it tastes exactly like the original. The only thing I did different was to let it cook at least an hour longer on low heat. Also, I don't really think it's possible to use too many onions since they cook into the soup. I use about 4-5 medium sized onions for this recipe. The sad thing is it's always gone by the end of the day.","I have not had the Walkabout soup in years so I can't really state how close it is.  However, as a creamy onion soup, it is very good.<br\/><br\/>I followed the directions with three minor changes.  Normally I advocate following the recipe exactly as it is or else I don't review it but these were small changes.  I omitted the first 1\/4 teaspoon of salt, used Knorr reduced stock (1 tub) in place of the bouillon and used Velveeta Queso Blanco rather than regular.  Those substitutions were due to what I had on hand.<br\/><br\/>The directions were very clear and I ended up with a creamy, oniony soup that was delicious just as it was and I'm sure I will make it again.  <br\/><br\/>If I were to serve it as a main dish for more than just myself, I would serve it with bowls of croutons, cooked potato cubes, diced ham, cooked corn, shredded cheese, etc...  so that people could dress it up themselves.  But as a starter, it would be great as it is.","This soup was awesome!!!! I doubled the recipe and it was perfect. My husband loved it too!! I added some cornstarch mixed with a little bit of water at the end because it wasn't as thick as I'm use to at Outback, but a delicious soup.","Warming rich & delicious on a cold night. This soup followed a chopped salad & was accompanied by toasted ciabatta bread.  Made for a wonderful supper - to be repeated here. Thanks Molly53 for posting","Love it! Perfect! Absolutely a reply. Tried several times and never fails!","This is the exact copy of outbacks soup!! This is my favorite soup, now I dont have to travel 30 minutes for it!! Thanks for posting!!","I don&#039;t know what I did wrong but my soup didn&#039;t turn out looking very good.The milk in the white sauce curdled after putting on warm for 30 minutes. The flour for the white sauce got lumpy but the taste was really good. I refuse to let this great tasting soup defeat me so I made it again the next night and I think I conquered it.  LOL! This time I used cornstarch in the white sauce like I usually do when I make a white sauce. Yea no lumps!  Great tasting soup. Maybe next time I will add a little white cooking wine to the soup as it cooks.Thanks Molly for posting. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup","Very tasty, although I don&#039;t know how much I can compare to Outback&#039;s version, which blew me away first taste.  Great recipe, and i never, ever made soup from scratch before.  However, feel I must have done something wrong - maybe too much milk, because I had to add more pepper and cheese to boost flavor.  Didn&#039;t use the bouillon cubes, and maybe that&#039;s it.  Next time, I will try to prepare exactly to directions.  Even still, it&#039;s a flavorful soup that&#039;s very satisfying.  Also, threw some frozen corn in the microwave and added to mixture.  Yum.","This recipe was pretty good except I think it called for too much salt. The velveeta cheese is salty enough. But pretty darn close to the actual soup! I ended up adding mkre milk because it was way too salty for me and a little too thick.","Just wondering how do you get the nice brown top on the soup like on the picture as the recipe doesn&#039;t say to place in the oven to brown. If you do what temp. And For How long.","Great recipe. Husband said better than Outback. Did make one addition. I added 1\/4 packet peppered gravy mix blended with some cold milk, as seemed like it would be right. Soup was perfect. Will def make again.","Can not say enough about this soup. Doubled up on everything in the recipe and followed to a T. Awesome! Just as good if not better than Outback's. Thank You!","RE: The White Sauce. You do NOT need to do anything special with the &quot;white sauce&quot; - I know the other recipes you find on YouTube go into some detail about thickening the white sauce in another pot, but you DON&quot;T need to. I just put all the white sauce ingredients in a blender (flour, butter, whole milk) and blend until it is totally incorporated and actually foamy. This method completely eliminates the &quot;chunky&quot; uneven mix you get if the white sauce doesn't like the temperature of the chicken broth. Try it, it'll save you some time and cleanup.","This soup is so awesome. I followed directions to a t but think next time I am going to use a little less butter.

I had some plain bagels to cut up and dip. I did use jarred pasta sauce instead of the pizza sauce-but I would have used the same to make pizzas. This was easy to make and I will make it again!","Good, basic recipe, but a little bland. Would suggest flavoring it with basil and oregano to start.","This was a real fun meal for the kids. It was our first attempt at fondue with the kids and they loved every minute of it. I used \"Papa John's Pizza\" Pizza Sauce #108447 for the sauce. I think next time I will leave out the fennel as it gave a different flavour to the sauce that I did not really like. I have added this recipe to my \"recipes to use ground beef mix\" because that is what I used for the ground beef.","Made it for my kids they loved it.  Had leftover so I took a pizza crust spread the rest over and baked in the oven.  Awesome.  I also added my seasonings to the hamburg and onion mix while it was cooking, just habit, taste comes out better","I didn't follow much on this recipe, but it inspired me to my own version. I took jar'd spagehtti sauce and put it in an electric fondue pot and dipped prepared meatballs (thought meatballs would be more fun since we could use the dipping stick more often) and garlic breadsticks in it. Very yummy and a big hit. Not sure how to rate this, since I didn't use many of the ingredients, but wanted to give you the credit because if I wouldn't have seen this recipe, I would have never thought to do a Italian\/pizza fondue. Thanks!!! :-)","I didn't add any of the spices since I thought my pizza sauce was pretty good already (forgot which recipe I used for it).  I only used mozzarella cheese, but it still came out very good.  The leftovers were just as tasty, although they didn't look very nice.  I served this with breadsticks, thanks!","We like to try new fondues.  And this one is amazing.  It tastes like pizza.  I didn't use fennel seeds.  I used oregano and basil.","Inspired by this recipe, I created my own vegan version.  I used about 8 oz. of Smart Grounds (ground beef alternative), about 1\/2 cup leftover spaghetti sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, 10 oz. of Vegan Gourmet brand mozzarella \"cheese\" (cubed), onion powder, garlic powder, basil, and oregano.  Since Smart Grounds are already cooked, I just plopped all the ingredients in the fondue pot, covered it with foil, and stirred frequently until the \"cheese\" melted.  It was absolutely delicious and my meat-eating husband agreed!  It was almost fat-free and 100% cholesterol-free and I don't think anyone would guess it was vegan without knowing.  Thanks for posting this; it's a great springboard of a recipe!","This was a great meal for my family.  My kids hovered over the fondue pot and were getting upset with whoever was dipping in because they were \"taking too much\".  LOL  I will be making this again!  Thank you so much for a crowd pleaser!  I also didnt use fennel seeds because I didnt have any, and I wil remember next time to add it!","I don't know why but this seemed a little bland to my husband and I.  We thought next time, we'll add small diced pepperoni, and more mozzerella and less cheddar.","Although, I didn't use all the ingredients...I thought this was a great idea!  I just had pizza sauce (with spices and sausage in it) and added some cheese.  Thanks for the idea! It turned out great!","This was great! I did leave out the fennel seeds (personally dislike) and I didn't have any cornstarch but it still turned out delicious. We've made this several times since. My children LOVE it!","This was a delicious recipe!!! For Valentine's Day, 2009, we had a big fondue party over at our house! We invited our friends to come over at 5:30 in the evening dressed as people from the 70s for an awesome dinner of fondue. We had fun with some 70s trivia,  and then sat down for \"The Muppet Show\" and \"The Electric Company\". We had an absolute blast!!!","We had so much fun with this!  We served it with cubes of focaccia bread and toasted raviolis.  I wanted something fun for the kids to introduce them to fondue and this was a great hit.  Thank you.","We decided to have a fondue night so I made a half recipe. Served with cheese filled tortellini, toasted garlic bread and Italian bread. I did add some diced pepperoni to up the pizza flavour.  It was excellent, and my son just loved it. Thx Lainie!","This was a big hit at Euchre....Great dip, I did change the meat though, I used Turkey Italian sausage and some mini pepperoni in it instead of beef...it turned out fabulous....","I am not a fondue person but, my kids loved this recipe!  I did not use fennel seeds for my kids taste>I cook everynight for my family and usually gourmet but this really is fun.  My hubby needed pasta and let the kids have the fondue.  Try it!","Didn't like the sound of the fennel at all, but included it anyway.  Wow, am I glad that I did!  This really came out very good.  I might have gone a little cheese crazy, but it was very yummy.  It was very good and very thick, going perfectly with the home made garlic bread.  Great idea; thank you for posting!","We do fondue every New Years Eve. The kids were wanting it again a few days later. I found this recipe and made it tonight. They loved it! I left out the meat and cut the recipe in 1\/2. They thought it was the greatest thing.

A perfect substitution for those pizza cravings.  I use a melon baller to scrape out the gills from the mushrooms.  That is a neat and quick way to get rid of them, as they aren't too pretty cooked.\r\n\r\nI made this dish as you directed, but I did add one seeded, deveined jalapeno with the other peppers.  It wasn't that noticible.  Maybe next time I will add some pepper flakes instead of the jalapeno.\r\n\r\nI will definately keep this on my list of zaar \"best finds\".  Thanks for sharing.","I've made this a couple of times and my DH and I love them.   Some portobellos can be so thick they don't get cooked all the way through,  so I found that if I grill them first (about 2-3 minutes a side) before stuffing them, they are cooked better. I add fresh chopped hot peppers from our garden to spice things up because that's what we like.  We eat 2 each as a main meal with a salad and we're completely satisfied.  I added fresh garlic but only after the mix is sauted.  The flavour of garlic comes through much stronger when it's not cooked.  We LOVE garlic!  I also added salt & pepper.  This is a real nice and easy meal.","While I thought these were pretty good, the rest of the family wasn&#039;t as impressed.  A couple of things I would do differently next time: Pre-grill the mushroom before stuffing so that it cooks all the way.  Add some more seasoning, at the very least garlic, salt and pepper. Cut back on the oil, you just need enough to keep the peppers from sticking to the pan.  I guess I should have read the other reviews before making these, most of them mention these points.

Will probably make again and add about an eighth cup of oil, which will raise the fat to only 4g per slice per 8-slice loaf.","I made this recipe two days ago.  Didn't want to open a jar of applesauce, so instead I used 1\/2 cup of vegetable oil. Was deliscious!!!","Nice texture, but it came out too sweet even with using splenda. Might be good to reduce it to 2\/3 cup.","i made this banana bread and added chopped pecans instead of almonds.  i added chocolate chips to the batter and it turned out really good!  i also omitted the lemon zest. thank you for this versitile recipe. very yummy!","One important thing is missing from this recipe: Salt! Never bake sweets without salt. One teaspoon was the right amount for this recipe. \n\nNow that that's out of the way: This is terrific! Mine came out a little dry; after just 45 minutes it was almost overdone. I substituted yogurt for the applesauce since the best (fattening) recipe I know calls for sour cream. Also cut the sugar by 1\/3, added whole wheat flour to the mix, used two whole eggs, and mixed in some chopped toasted walnuts. Next time, when I'm not making this for my Splenda-phobic family, I'll use brown sugar blend.","I used cinnamon applesauce with this and it was delicious!!!! It is the first time for me making home made bread thank you for the recipe!","Good for butter free quick bread.  More chewy (stretchy?) than my regular banana bread.  Good flavor and easy to make.  Liked the applesauce and egg whites instead of oil and whole eggs.  Added a cup of chocolate chips to one batch and that was good.  Thanks.  ~Messy44","I would have given it 5 stars, but I found it to be quite dry when I followed the recipe to a T. Here are the changes that made this bread even better (for me): Wheat flour instead of white; a pinch of nutmeg; brown sugar instead of white; one whole egg and two egg whites; and about 2 tsp of olive oil. This combination yielded a moist, delicious loaf that is still pretty low on fat and bursting with flavour.","Really good. didnt have apple sauce so I replaced with a cooked apple and pear mashed up. Threw all the ingredients into a mixer.","I cut a little of the sugar, added a bit more cinnamon and some chocolate chips to this recipe.  It took forever to bake though.  I had to leave the house so I finally turned the oven off and left it in the oven, so I'm not sure how long I had to bake it.  Second time I made it though it baked in the normal amount of time.

The result was a bread that was yummy, though a bit mushy.  We don't mind, but for guests I would have adherred more closely to the recipe, which is fantastically simple and delicious.","I have been searching for a good banana bread recipe for over a year and I finally found it!  What a super simple recipe with excellent results!!!  Try it - You'll LOVE it!!","I have tried many many banana bread recipes over the years - and this is the absolute best.","Yes, this really is the BEST BANANA BREAD!","Tried this recipe and the Grandchildren love it.Now I'm asked all the time to make this bread for them. I love it too.","5 stars baby!!! Bam!!! This is the bomb banana bread!!\r\nthe term bomb is a good thing :) Kids like it. Neighbor\r\nlikes it. Husband likes it. I like it.

I added walnuts to mine.  Would recommend this to anyone.  A winner for sure!","LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!  I only used 3 med. to large bananas and used 1\/2 c. turbinado sugar and 1\/2 c. white sugar, still turned out great.  Of course, flavor is even richer after a day or so.","Nice moist banana bread.  My husband was especially impressed with the nice way the banana flavor comes through.  I think I will add chopped walnuts next time.","My 10-year old daughter was looking for something to make and found this recipe.  She made it all by herself and it was wonderful!","This bread is great!!!  Added pecans and could have eaten the whole loaf myself. Quick to mix and taste is supreme!!!","I made this recipe twice, both times it was delicious! the first time following the recipe exactly with choc. chips. the second, i substituted whole-wheat flour and applesauce, due to lack of ingreidents and added walnuts and cranberries.  the result was a very moist tasty bread.  this one's a keeper!","Very ncie recipe","This is very tasty and moist. The only thing I would be able to tell anyone is that if you use a non stick pan.....I would decrease the cooking time by at least 5 minutes. It was still VERY good but the bottom crust was a little too done for my taste. This recipe is a keeper!","This turned out really well.\r\nI used 3\/4 cup sugar and 1 1\/4 cup flour.\r\nThe bread was dense, but had a wonderful flavor.\r\nI sprayed the pan with cooking spray just to be sure it came out in one piece.","Nice, moist texture. Had it for breakfast and it has a great flavor. Added an extra banana and thought it tasted great. ","This recipe has been a family favorite for a long time. I make mini-loaves so I can freeze some. When making the smaller loaves you don't have to cook them as long. This recipe doubles well also.","Awesome recipe! Thanks. My family loved it.","This is awesome. So simple to make in no time at all. I stuck to exactly this recipe and made muffins (about 20 min). These are incredible, perfect, Nice and moist. Most definitely a keeper and will be used often. Thank you so much.","This recipe is the best i've come across, it is so easy...the banana bread is so moist and flavorful...this is a thumbs up recipe!","Incredible! I would give up chocolate for this stuff.  It is SO EASY to make and a great thing to give to friends and neighbors. ","In spite of many mini-disasters (dropped the egg on the floor and threw it in anyway- shh...don't tell anyone, and then dropped the whole salt\/pepper shaker in the batter) this turned out gorgeously.  I only had three large bananas and it was perfect.  I made a tray of mini-muffins and one loaf that was a little on the small side.  \r\nOne thing to watch- I used a no-stick pan and it browned really quickly, I thought I was burning it.  I took it out at least ten minutes early and it was perfect and very moist.  The muffins stayed nice and light and were ready after 15 minutes (and hubby literally inhaled about 6 of them in one sitting, I've never seen him do that...).  Excellent recipe, this will be the new one to use!","Mmmmmm...this is got to be the best banana bread recipe ever! I had found one previously that was pretty good...but I didn't have any creme de freshe that the recipe called for. So I can online to look for a good recipe...and I think I've found it!! Uses all the basic ingredients, but the results are incredible! The only thinkthat I did differently was use brown sugar instead of white sugar. But just remeber that if you are using overly ripe bananas...like I did, minimize the amount of sugar because it was a bit too sweet. Other than that, theres no complaints from me! Tomorrow I am going to be making four loaves. Two to keep at home and two to bring to a party\/potluck thing I am going to!! Definately a keeper! :)","This recipe is great.  My 6 year old loves it.  I made it for my secretaries one day and they loved it too.  Great recipe!!!!!","I've used many banana bread recipes over the years and this is the one I'm keeping in the front of my recipe folder from now on. It was simple, baked through the center evenly and delicious. It was all gone in one day. Doubled the recipe this week and made muffins out of it too. Baked the muffins for about 25 mins and I'm sure they'll be singing for more tomorrow.","This was the best!  I didn't use a loaf pan but an 8x8 disposable cake pan.  I had enough left over to also use 2 small round tin pans (the ones the size of chicken pot pie pans).  I added about 1\/4 Cup walnuts which was just enough so it didn't taste nutty.  I think the 4 bananas and the vanilla made it taste just right.  Also creaming the butter and sugar rather than just stirring made a major difference from other banana breads I have tried.  I will definitely be making this recipe again and will pass onto my friends.  Thanks!","WONDERFUL banana bread from a super easy recipe.  A++","This is the best banana bread we've ever had. I did have to increase the baking time about 20 minutes to get it done in the middle. The bananas I used were huge! Thanks for sharing this very good recipe.","Terrific bread! Made this this morning to use up LOTS of old bananas I bought on sale. I made three mini-loaves, so I only baked them for about 35-40 minutes. They were so gorgeous and brown! Thanks for posting!","I was looking for a banana bread recipe to use up 4 over-ripe bananas and this fit the bill for all the ingredients I had on hand.  I was nervous, as it was baking, as I did the dishes because I discovered that I only put in 1\/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup as directed.  The bread's taste and texture turned out great, however, and I look forward to making it again with the right amount of sugar!","Even better the next day!  It was even more moist the next day and it really does keep well in the fridge.  I will be using your recipe for the holidays.  Thanks!!","This is an excellent banana bread. I don't know how well it would last in the fridge because none was left over!  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe.","Best banana bread I have ever had.

It was really easy to make and turned out perfect.  Very moist and delicious!","This was very good.  I added 1\/2 tsp of ginger (ground), 1\/4 tsp of ground allspice and ground nutmeg.  It did cook faster than stated and turned a dark brown on the outside, but it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing!","Easy and delicious. Thanks.","Lovely taste. The best I've tried and I've been experimenting a lot lately.  I may try reducing the butter to 1\/3 of a cup, as it was a teeny bit greasy, but absolutely delicious.\r\n\r\nThanks","Very moist and great flavor.  Followed the recipe to a \"T\".  I'll probably bake the bread less than an hour next time...the edges were slightly overdone.  (My gas oven may be a little warmer).  Overall great recipe!","This was a fabulous banana bread recipe.  So many of them use too few bananas and too much butter or oil.  I made one batch with the butter and one batch substituting 1\/2 cup of apple sauce for the butter and both turned out wonderfully.","the name says it all 'the best banana bread ever'!! my family loved this bread!! thanks for a winner lkadlec! ","After baking for 60 minutes at 325 bread was burnt on outside and undercooked inside. Not the best recipe I have tried :(","This banana bread was the best that i have had, the family loved it nice and moist . Will make this many times again ..........","yummy, yummy, I have made this banana bread twice in one week. It's sooo good, I keep telling my husband to try some but my kids and I eat it all before he gets a chance!","This is the 2nd time i baked these delicious banana bread.  But this time, i put it in muffin tins, and i was disappointed coz it didn't domed.  Even if putting batter upto the rim, they formed a \"saucer\" top.  But they still tastes fabulous with black \"lines\" that i am looking for in a banana bread. I use 6 (5-6\") very black\/ripe bananas and added only 3\/4 c sugar, and 1\/3 c margarine.  Next time i'll reduce the sugar more if i am using a VERy ripe bannas coz they turned out too sweet for us.","This is a great recipe. Worth all 5 stars. Add a cup of chopped walnuts for a nice variation.","This was the best banana bread we have tried! I doubled the repice and made one loaf as the recipe states and the other with chocolate chips.  The most moist banana bread ever! Thanks for posting!","Excellent flavor and texture.  My daughter likes her banana bread dark (go figure) so I leave the mashed bananas out for a bit.","sooooooo good!\r\nI think next time I will add halved pecans on the top and maybe some chopped ones inside.\r\nThis was reallly delicious =)\r\nThanks!","This really is the best banana bread.  My 3 year old loved helping and everyone loved eating","This was good bread. It may have been the really overripe bananas I used but I had to bake mine for much longer than the time given. When I took it out it was still a little underdone but was gobbled up all the same. I think I'll attempt this again in the future with regular bananas to be on the safe side! Thanks for sharing.","Very easy to make recipe - banana bread was fantastic and gobbled up fast - will be a firm family favourite - even my 2yo loved it!","I made muffins using this recipe and they were awesome!  I added walnuts and got 12 muffins.  My search for the perfect banana bread is over.  Thanks!","This is a great recipe - the bread has a great flavor, and it is extremely easy to make. I often add a handful of chopped walnuts to give the bread a little something extra, and it comes out delicious! The reason why I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 has nothing to do with taste. It has to do with cooking time. At 350 degrees for one hour, the loaves have come out dark brown and dry around the edges and completely uncooked (not just undercooked) in the middle. I have a brand new oven with very precise temperature settings, so I'm confident that my oven is not causing the problem. I'm still working on a way to make this bread bake evenly, and I think it's worth the time spent experimenting. If you do make this recipe, you might want to check it several times during the cooking process and\/or check out the cooking times and temperatures listed for some comparable banana bread recipes on this site for better results.","I also made muffins using this recipe and added some walnuts.  It was so simple to make using 'cups' and my son loved helping me.  Definately the best my muffins have ever turned out!","This is truely the best banana bread ever!!!

Easy, moist and delicious, and I don't even LIKE bananas!  The only change I made was to add a half-cup of applesauce because I only had three bananas.  Thanks for a keeper!","Hint when making banana bread:  After pouring the batter into the pan, let it sit about 20 minutes before baking to get the full banana flavor !!","Awesome banana bread. It was super simple, moist and delicious. Its a keeper. My search for a great banana bread recipe stops here!!!","This was my husbands favorite of any loaf I have made yet.  I left the bananas a little chunky and loved them that way.","Awsome, easy and really great to give to family.","Perfect recipe, thank you! I didn\u00c2\u00b4t have regular flour on hand so I used self rising flour and omitted the baking soda and salt. I also added 1\/2 cup thinly sliced almonds and reduced the sugar to 3\/4 cup.

Thanks again for sharing this, an uncomplicated recipe with great results!","Easy and Delish.  I got 14 muffins out of these and only baked for 30 minutes.  My husband who isn't a big banana bread fan loved these, he ate 3 last night and took 3 more to work!","I wish I could give this recipe more stars. After years of searching for the perfect banana bread recipe, I think this is it!!\n\nI doubled the recipe and baked for 20 minutes, using silicone muffin pans. In total, I ended up with 30 muffins.\n\nI only hope they last long enough in this house to freeze some for later.\n\nThey are moist, luscious and really  taste like banana.\n\nI will use this again and again.","This is a keeper!  I added some chocolate chips and it was delicious.  Very moist and had a lot of banana flavour.","The moistest banana bread ever! Though I had trouble getting the bread to rise and I followed the recipe exactly...it seemed to deflate after i left it to cool. This seems to happen with other banana bread recipes that I've tried also. Wonder if anyone had the same problem?","I added 1 cup of sour cream and an extra 1\/4 cup of flour to the doubled recipe and it was awesome.

I actually thought I had made it before but can't find a review so if I reviewed it and this one is different I hope the better of the two shows up.  :) I found it to be a little on the dry side, and my father, well he didn't like it at all, but he has become a very picky eater lately.  Followed recipe exactly.","This is a nice recipe which is very easy. I find that I can add extra \"stuff\" like apples, walnuts, blue berries and a bit of sour cream or yogurt to it and it still comes out tasty! Thank you.","Simple recipe with excellent results.  I have used this recipe many times and everyone has loved it.","This wasssssssssssss the best Banana bread I have ever made .\r\n Mine always fell after baking I was going to give up BUT GLAD I found this one.

Melody","WOW!!!!\nThis simple recipe is outstanding!! \n\nI used 2 HUGE bananas , I can only imagine the taste with 4! \n\nI also didn't have a loaf pan, so I greased and floured an 8x8 square pan , set the timer for 20 minutes and kept checking after the 20 minutes was up. It took about 40 minutes to be done. \n\nMOIST!\n\nOh , I also used Almond flavoring instead of vanilla, only because it's my new \"thing\"  LOL\n\nGreat recipe and I thank you very much for posting! :D","Very good bread. Nice and dense, the way we like it. Thanks!","Perfect, five star banana bread!!  I am so delighted to have found this one!  Delicious, moist, just perfect in every way!  I also added walnuts as personal preference - but WOW!","I'd give this recipe 10 stars!!!! Ive made it 3 times already this week!  The girls at work all loved it. I follow recipe exactly. Last time I made it I added 8 oz of chopped pecans. Absolutey The BEST banana braed!  Thanks!","just baked this and it is very moist...not too moist like pudding but like banana bread should be.\nThis is a keeper!","Made into muffins, it makes 18 if you use 1\/4c to pour into pan. Added 1tsp of mixed spice b\/c i just think banana bread should have some spice...fab by the way.  Topped with a quick butter frosting glaze...life is good. thanks!","I forgot the vanilla and it was still delicious!  I too had some trouble with my oven - my bread got really brown but didn't cook all the way in the middle.  I had 10 minutes of baking time left but it was getting so brown I was afraid I would burn it!  Next time I guess I will have to let it go at least 5 more minutes and see if that works.","These were so good!! I doubled the recipe and after making two trays of muffins and popped them in the oven, I realized that I forgot to add Vanilla. So I added some vanilla to the rest of the batch. The ones with Vanilla were just as good as the ones without vanilla. I made muffins and and they baked for about 25-30 minutes!! This is a keeper!! Thanks!!","This was delicious and so easy to make.  Took no time.  Definitely a keeper.  Very moist!  My friend made a loaf of banana bread from a different recipe, and we both prefered this one:D  So thank you soo much!","This is delicious!  And simple!  I live in Japan and don't have an oven so I mixed this up and put it in my rice cooker and steam cooked it.  Delish!!!  If anyone does this, I steamed it twice in the rice cooker just to be sure it was cooked all the way through (I'm not sure if this was necessary but it certainly had no negative effects).","This was the best banana bread I have ever made my family and office all went crazy for it I now have requests to make it again on a daily basis!!!","I wish I could give more stars! SO tasty. I only had 3 bananas so I pureed one mango I had and added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1\/4 tsp of allspice, 1\/4 tsp of nutmeg to the flour mixture. Then I mixed a little brown sugar and coconut in a seperate dish and sprinkled over top before baking. It came out so moist with a sweet crispy crust. Will Definitely make again...and again.","This recipe is so simple and the results are awesome.  I took some to work and was told by others that this banana bread is \"Banging.\"","great recipe!!!!","Best recipe for banana bread I have found.

Easy to follow recipe, great hot with butter on top.","Very good and moist.  Even without nuts.  Thanks for the recipe.","Soooooo good!  I am always afraid to try new banana bread recipes, but there is nothing to be afraid of with this one. My bananas were large so I used only 3 instead of 4. The result: perfect, delicious banana bread!","My goodness, this bread is good. Moist, flavorful and soft. Wow, is all I can say. I made muffins out of these and it took 35 minutes. Thank you for sharing your recipe.","Easy and delicious","So easy even I could do it without messing up!! I agree with some other reviewers that the baking time was off for me, but I just kept it in a bit longer and it came out fine. Everyone loved it :) Next time I think I will add crushed walnuts and try it as muffins! Thanks for the recipe","This was VERY good, only problem I ran into was that the 60 minutes at 350 degrees wasn't nearly long enough to cook the bread throughout. I had to put it in another 15-30 minutes. Another thing I will try next time is to add some walnuts for a bit crunch.. it just seemed a little too... soft for my tastes. I will absolulty be making this again... and hopefully it will last our family more than two days this time. :)","I don't know what went wrong because after reading the reviews, I was expecting an extraordinary banana bread but this didn't turn out very well. The texture was great (the way a banana bread\/cake should be to me, not pudding like or too dense) but taste-wise, it wasn't the best.","I have never baked breads or cakes before and was most impressed with myself for the way it turned out. The recipe was excellent in directions and proportion. I just wasn't certain about the size of loaf tray to use but bought a small since it was cheaper - it turned out to be the right size. However I did make a few minor changes to the recipe. \nI only had 3 bananas so I put in roughly crushed walnuts with the bananas and garnished with walnut halves on top after pouring into the loaf tray for a good texture. And I didn't have baking soda so I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead.","Delicious!!!  Basic recipe is perfect.  My bananas were big, so I used almost 2 cups of flour.  Came out perfect - baked in 1 hr and 8 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!","Very good and simple to make.  DS loved it!","This was very good and moist. I only had 3 bananas so I added about 1\/4 c. milk to the mix for more moisture. Very easy to make. Thank you for the recipe!","Only had 3 bananas, so added a grated apple and used 3\/4 cup of agave syrup (low GI sugar that comes from cactii) in place of the sugar.  Yummo!  Hubby and I rated it as a definite winner.","PERFECT banana bread!  Thanks!","I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I was looking for good banana bread recipe that could be just as good as my mom's, and it is BETTER!!This banana bread is the moist banana bread I have ever tasted! I have never had so many compliments on a recipe!","The taste was outstanding, problem I had was with the \"Crust\" on the top and bottom got really brown before the rest was done (only after 45min) but other wise the taste was outstanding after I picked off the bottom layer LOL","I liked this bread and the texture was nice. If I were to make this again I would cut down the butter, it seemed a bit oily. But over all not bad.","It was ok, I used corn oil, and i baked it in a cake pan for 50 min, then iced w\/ cream cheese icing.","Very good banana bread! I did stir in a cup of chopped pecans, but otherwise followed the recipe, and we all enjoyed this sweet, moist treat! Thanks!","The name of this banana bread is all wrong..This is SCRUMPTIOUS BEST EASY BANANA BREAD!\r\nI added some cinnamon,nutmeg,and allspice too. Also, I used real butter and I used SPLENDA instead of the sugar..also used increased the pure vanilla extract to 3\/4 teaspoon..I used about 3\/4 cup finely chopped walnuts.Didn't have a loaf pan so I used an 8x8 glass pan.  I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top. Did I mention this is scrumptious! YUM..thx Ikadlec! Chef Judi Coleman","Added chocolate chips, put in muffin tins and baked for 22 minutes and they are wonderful!  A new favorite in a several year hunt for good banana muffins!  Hurray!","Made this bread yesterday and but into it this morning. Amazing!!!! I kept it out overnight and did not see a reason to stick it in the frig. I was just fine at room temp. I did add walnuts to mine and it added a little extra.","So simple and yet so good.  A very moist, delicious banana bread.  We made cupcakes and they turned out wonderful.  Thank you!","This sure doesn't need another review, but it's getting one any way.\r\n\r\nThis was absolutely delicious.  I did add a can of blueberries, because I had them.  I doubt that made much difference.  It's a really \"banana\" flavor.  I took the hint from another poster, and let it sit on the counter (in the pan and before I put it in the pan) for about 20 min.  \r\n\r\nI think this would work nicely in muffins, and just check them a while before the hour is up.  An absolute keeper.\r\n\r\nI forgot to time it, and I believe I took it out early, because after cutting a few slices (hot from the oven), the center was oozing.  I hope I don't forget to get the remainder out before it's burned, but at least I got two slices.","All I have to say about this recipe is Yummm!  This is so good yet simple. The only thing I changed was to increase the sugar from 1 cup to 1 and 1\/2 cups.","MMMMM MMMMM good, made it exactly as stated and it turned out soooo yummy!","great recipe!","This was wonderful!!!! It turned out moist, and perfect. I followed the directions exactly...thanks for the great recipe. This is a keeper. :)","Thought this was great! I made 2 loaves last night. I finished baking close to midnight & there was only one piece left before going to bed. I guess you can say the family loves it! It is easy to make. I only had 7 bananas to make the double batch, but it still turned out great. I do tent foil over it about 45 minutes into baking because it starts to get dark. Other than that, no change necessary. Thanks!","WOW WOW WOW!!  This was the BEST banana bread I have ever eaten!!  I just about ate the whole loaf!!  The butter is what makes this bread.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.  I'm sharing this one with my family and friends.","I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1\/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and it was great!!!","Loved it! I used 1\/3 less fat margarine, and added chopped walnuts, cinnamon and nutmeg. I don't think the extra spices made much difference though. This is a great, easy bread!","Delicious!  Thanks.  My kids loved it.","Tried this recipe but was disappointed. Not as flavorful or as moist as Sour Cream Banana Bread (Recipe #9351).","the flavor was very good, however i found it a little too greasy,i will cut down on the butter a little and add a tsp of baking powder to give it a little lift.  All in all it does taste very good and will be using butter instead of shortening that called for in my other recipe.","I should have waited a little longer before cutting into the loaf, because it was still kinda mushy. Next day it had set up really well and was delicious topped with crunchy peanut butter. I might reduce the banana ever so slightly next time, maybe to 3 1\/2. Great recipe. I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor.","i have gone thru many banana bread recipes that were a huge letdown...either too mushy in the middle or too tough, etc.  this one is simple and delicious and it comes out PERFECT every time!!  to keep the edges from getting overdone i cover the bread in foil and then cut an opening in the center of the foil so that the middle of the bread gets fully cooked.  i have played around and added\/substituted  to this recipe like using plantains instead of bananas, adding shredded coconut, and using almond extract instead of vanilla...it had a very 'Caribbean' flavor and was a big hit!!  but, you really cant go wrong with this great basic recipe-awesome job ikadlec!!","Normally I make a low-fat moist banana bread. This recipe was more of a bread. We enjoyed in our home but will probably go back to substituting applesauce for butter. It also was much sweeter than we were use to... that being said, it will not last long in the house!","This was wonderful!  The last ten minutes of baking I turned it down to 300, bc my oven runs hot.  Also, I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter (personal taste).  Great recipe, my boyfriend loved it!  Tahnks!","This is my husband's new favorite banana bread recipe. I make it once a week! Sometimes we add 1\/2 cup walnuts or pecans but it is delicious either way. Thanks for another great recipe!","I really like this recipe. It is very easy to follow and easy to make! I only changed a few things. I used whole wheat flour, added Chocolate Chips and a little extra vanilla and cinnamon. It is so awesome. Thank you for posting it.","I've baked this yummy bread several times now.  It is so good you can add to it and it will always come out wonderful!  I've added walnuts and hazelnuts on different occasions; both were great.  My family loves when I add apple and hazelnut to this recipe.  Give it a try, you wont be sorry.  It is one of my favorites!!!","Great recipe - easy to make moist, light and fluffy.  My kids and I love it!  I make the recipe with walnuts and as muffins - bake 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  Yummy!","Excellant!","Just finished making this. It turned out beautiful. It tastes wonderful and is moist. I followed the recipe exactly and actually was skeptical that it wouldn't have enough flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised. Easy to make. I baked my loaf at 350 degrees in my convection oven. I believe I took it out after 45 minutes.","Great recipe! My husband is really picky with his banana bread, but loved the way this turned out!","This was GREAT! We only had extra large eggs so I used 1 egg and 1 egg white. I also added pecans to the mix. My boyfriend and I are eating it up as I type. Thanks for the post!","Thank you for this easy recipe! I have made it several times and every time it has come out plerfect, eventhough I like to \"health it up\" a little. I add about 1\/4 cup ground flax seed and use coconut oil instead of the butter.  Today I replaced some of the oil with apple sauce... Yum!  No matter what I have done it comes out very moist every time!","Great recipe, will use again.  Simple ingredients and instructions make a delicious bread.   Followed suggestion to leave out for 20min, can definitely taste the banana! Be careful not to overmix.","Fantastic recipe!! Thank you! Easy to make, simple ingredients, very moist and delicious.","This is indeed the Best banana bread.  The real key to this recipe and any banana bread recipe is black almost rotten bananas.  Sounds gross but it is absolutely necessary, at least for me to guarantee rave results.  I baked these in small loaf tins giving me two small loaves.  I cooked each one for only 40 mins.  I also added a little cinnamon in my batter, my little secret.  Well, I guess not anymore :)  Fab recipe, thanks!  Pooh Bear","Absolutely the correct name for this recipe!  I have made banana bread using other recipes and have not been terribly impressed.  This one is definitely the best I have ever made.  Made it once in a 13 x 9 pan and baked for 30 min.  Excellent!  Am making it again today and adding pecans.  Just writing about it has be salivating!","Wow.  I am a banana\/nut person and I loved this.  My husband and kids enjoyed it too.  It is so moist, even the next day.  I added half a cup of chopped walnuts, but not necessary.  Great recipe, thank you.","This is a super easy recipe but SO good.  The day I baked it, it was very light and almost delicate.  But after a day in the fridge, it became much more dense and heavier.  I only had three bananas, so I imagine it would be even better with all four.","This was my first time making banana bread and it turned out really well. I took it out of the oven about 7 minutes early because I noticed it getting pretty dark on the top. It turned out really well...It is definitely moist! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!","Very delicious bread. Made it because my DH has been asking me to make banana bread and he doesn't go for my \"health doctored\" ones. This came out moist and very banana-y tasting. His only complaint now is how come I only made one loaf, lol. Apparently we need more of this bread!","Absolutely the best banana bread I have ever made. I will never use another recipe.","It is the best banana bread that I have made. I gave my friend a piece and she love it.  So I am now making her, her owe loaf.","brilliant. might cut down the sugar a tiny bit next time, but otherwise everyone loved it.","YUM! I used 3, very ripe, bananas and wound up adding extra sugar by accident.  It didn't matter because it was lovely.  I am sharing it with my son and his tutor and we are having it warm!  No time to wait!  Thanks!","On a lazy Sunday afternoon, I made this banana bread. The recipe was easy to follow and the overall taste, devine! I added chopped walnuts and two teaspoons cinnamon! Thanks for this recipe.","Very good!  I cut down the sugar just a tad as suggested.  Was enjoyed by all.  Thank you for sharing this easy recipe, easy enough that my three year old helped make this.","This recipe is great! The first time I made it my family loved it! Try it i guarentee it is the best!","Really quick, easy and great results. Best banana bread recipe I have tried so far. As some of the others suggested I added some cinnamon (1tsp) and nutmeg (1\/4 -1\/2 tsp) and also some roughly chopped pecan nuts which worked well. Kept really well and moist in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe!","Yum-me! Yummy!!!\r\n\r\nI was in search of a banana bread to sneak in fruit for my 15 month old.  Next time I'm going to do some substitutions to bring the sugar down.\r\n\r\nI did follow one reviews suggestion to let the batter sit for 20 minutes.  I have no idea if that helped or why it would help.\r\n\r\nI also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1\/4 tsp of nutmeg.\r\n\r\nI love that thi recipe is so basic and the ingrediants are all pantry staples.  I can see making this weekly.  Walnuts would make it even better.  But, we are holding off on nuts until my son is a litle older\r\n\r\nI was worried about the time being too long from other reviews.  I think that it was about 40 minutes when I took it out of the oven.  I for sure suggest checking on it at 40 minutes.","My first attempt at banana bread...have to say, it turned out great.  I had to bake it about 15 mins longer than original recipe (not sure why, but it might be my oven or the fact that I added chocolate chips), but the end result was still perfect!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for posting.","The easiest I ever made and the best.  What a wonderful banana filled bread.  You must try.","So yummy and so easy! I added  a tsp of cinnamon but otherwise followed your recipe exactly. Thanks for such a great recipe!!","This recipe was simple to throw together with a fantastic result! My whole family woofed it down quickly, even the pickiest 2 y.o. Thanks so much for the perfect flavor and texture bread!","I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I have never made a banana bread that turned out. This banana bread is fabulous. I made 2 loaves, 1 with chocolate chips and 1 exactly as the recipe is. They both turned out really good. I brought them to a family gathering, everyone loved it.","I LOVE this recipe... I make it at least once a month from any over-ripe bananas we have laying around.  It's so easy and delicious!  I do change it up a little to (try) to make it a little healthier-- I use whole wheat flour,  reduce sugar to 3\/4 cup, and add 3 TBS of flax seeds, and sometimes I sub apple sauce for half the butter.  It's also to-die-for sprinkled with chocolate chips!!","This is a very good recipe, I probly will make this again. \r\nThanks for the recipe.\r\n~Chris~","Hi! ( tried your recipe today, and all I had was buckwheat flour, no vanilla either. So I subbed buckwheat, threw in all six frozen bananas, added another 1\/4 cup of buckwheat, and used oh my chai tea powder for flavoring. I threw in a handful of raisins, and the taste was to die for. I used your recipe because it was the most like Mom's recipe, and prayed. It turned out fabulous! Thank you... :)","I had a craving for banana bread so I made this. It's so simple and tasty! Absolutely delicious heated up and spread with butter! I added some allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon for some extra flavor the 2nd time I made this and it worked great. It was a little too sweet the first time I made it, but I think it was because I used extra-ripe bananas so if you use very ripe bananas, use less sugar (like 1\/4 cup less).","I love making this banana bread. I even save bananas just for this recipe. My family just loves this banana bread. Oh so good!!!!!","This is very good! I made 4 mini-loaves and it took about 45 minutes. I thought they were too brown because they looked darker than the pictures here. However, they were perfect! Now my room mates think I'm an awesome baker. Thanks for the great recipe.","My family really enjoyed this banana bread.  I made it last night and it is almost gone.","This was super yummy!  I added 1\/2 cup of mini chocolate chips and let the batter stand for 1\/2 hour before cooking to give it FULL banana flavor.  Will make it a staple at my home!!!  Thanks!","Not that this recipe needs another sterling review, but here's mine...\nThis bread is incredibly moist with a great banana flavor and a nice crust. I've tried other recipes and the part that touches the pan is a little too thick and overcooked tasting. The crust was as good as the rest of the loaf with this recipe! Mine stuck to the bottom of the pan, even after sitting for 10 minutes to cool initially. Next time I'll use butter and flour rather than spray and flour to grease the pan. \nI also was out of all-purpose flour, but had whole wheat and cake flour. So, I used 1 cup + 2 T cake flour and 1\/2 cup whole wheat flour. I think the whole wheat flour gave it a nice deep flavor, and it didn't make it too dense or dry at all.  \nThis is definitely something I will make regularly, and a great recipe to fiddle around with!","I have many recipes  of banana bread\/muffins. This one my kids will be very happy to wake up to!!! I have a 4week old that has been taking up much of mommies baking time, this one was quick and delicious!!! So thankyou a very busy momy of 5, from my hubby who has devoured three in about 5 minutes, and my 2 and 4 year old when they wake in the morn!","This banana bread is wonderful - really  moist and flavorful.  My family inhaled it and sent me out to buy more bananas!  I  added 1 cup of chocolate chips and dusted the top of the loaf with granulated sugar before baking.","This banana bread is delicious! My family devours it.  I've made it with regular sugar as well as with baking Splenda and we could not tell the difference.  Also, I just made muffins - which only took 25 minutes to cook (in a non-stick muffin pan).","going to try this one cause you don't have to use yeast. Love that.","I love banana bread and had to try this recipe that has been so highly rated.  I made it for guests and they raved about it!  Everyone wanted more - even their 2 year old!","This recipe was really great! Yhe only thing I did different was add 1 tsp. vanilla not 1\/2 cuz I like vanilla and I added some cinnamon cuz I like that too.  This recipe was quick and easy and I really needed that with 3 small children.  I did let the batter sit in the pan for 20 minutes, but not on purpose.  I cannot say it tasted more banana-ish or not since I have made banana bread in the past and have not done that.  Anyway, Thank You for a great recipe I will be using from now on!!!","These turned out great and were super simple!! I actually made mini- muffins and a mini-loaf. The muffins were done in about 20 minutes and the loaf took about 35 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!\nETA: I have made this dozens more times now and it still always comes out great!!","Look no further, this banana bread rocks!!","THE BEST EVER!!! I was so impressed with this recipe. To die for! I always add chocolate chips to my banana breads, too, but this one could even stand alone. THANK YOU!","this was great!  i have made it three time now, and it has turned out wonderful every time.  i always add the 1\/2 cup mini chocolate chips, and let it sit for about 20 minutes before baking.  delicious, and so easy!","Thanks for a lovely recipe, I like that you put heaps of bananas in, I also added some white chocolate chips and some dark chips, probably overkill but it is chocolate afterall. thanks, chris","Very good bread with a cake like texture. I used pumpkin pie spice and it was very good. I like that the ingredients are what I have on hand. I don't ususally have sour cream and buttermilk sitting around.","Thank You for this recipe. It is absolutely delicious, and the ingredient list is short and consists of things you probably already have on hand.The bread is moist,and tender, and unlike other recipes I have tried, is no greasy at all. The simplicity of the recipe allows for tweaking to fit individual tastes. I used brown sugar instead of white and added a little pumpkin pie spice( as recommended  by other reviewers) Next, I want to try using pumpkin instead of bananas. This is a great basic recipe.","Fabulous! My kids loved it as an afterschool snack. So did my husband. I am making it again tomorrow!","Great banana bread. We enjoy warming slices in a skillet with butter. Yummy!","super moist and yummy! i would definitely suggest cutting back on the sugar though. I added a around 3\/4s of a cup and because of the bananas it was still very sweet.","This is a pretty good recipe, not the best I've had.  I thought it tasted a little buttery other than than it was great!","Loved the banana bread.  Added some ground walnuts and chocolate chips too :-)","I made two different recipes and this one got the majority vote for the Best Banana Bread.","This bread was awesome and so easy to make. My husband loved it. We will be making this again.","If you are looking for a banana bread recipe, try this one! I had 3 spotty bananas and needed to use them up quickly. This recipe called for 4, but my 3 worked out just fine. Although I have followed this recipe precisely before, this time I had to use what was available. I replaced real butter with Blue Bonnet (it claims to cook like butter). I substituted all-purpose flour with self-rising and eliminated the salt and baking soda. Even with all of the changes, it turned out just as well as before. So, if you don't have all of the ingredients, don't be afraid to subsitute!","good","This bread was amazing.  It is easy to make and my family loved it.  You can taste the butter in every bite.  It was easily the best banana bread I have eaten.","My house smells so good right now!!  I made 6 batches of this wonderful banana bread so I now have: 3 full size loaves, 4 mini-loaves, 1 bundt cake and 18 muffins.   I found 2 bags of overripe bananas at the store for only 99 cents, so I used them all up this evening with this recipe.  This is the perfect banana bread recipe - great banana taste, very moist and not spongy like some other banana breads that I've tried.   I covered the full sized loaves with aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes of bake time so that the tops wouldn't be too browned.  I also substituted butter flavored Crisco for the butter because I found I didn't have any butter on hand.  This is now the only recipe I'll use.","I just made this and I followed the recipe exactly, apart from adding 1\/4 cup pecan chips.  My only complaint is that the outside of the bread is a bit overdone for my taste.  However, the center is perfect!  \r\n\r\nI covered it with foil for the last 10 minutes like another reviewer suggested, but that didn't seem to do the trick for me.  I don't bake often, so I have a feeling that this is my error and I'll have to see what I need to do differently next time.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the recipe!","This was an excellent base recipe that would work for lots of breads.  I used baby food for the bananas since I had some stage 1 bananas (my son likes the more flavorful stage 2).  I also tossed in a jar of carrots and apples because I am an undercover healthy food freak.  I doubled the recipe and used half wheat flour.  I resisted the urge to use splenda for the sugar, but I did use Smart Balance for the butter and you couldn't tell the difference.  I thought about adding some walnuts or craisins, but I didn't have any in my cupboard.  The carrots and apples are not noticable flavors in the finished product.","This bread is my new favorite base for any fruit quick bread. I used bananas and cranberries, pumpkin, etc and my family raves about it every time. This is easy and delicious. Thanks!","Perfect! It was so easy to make and it was delicious. I didn't crush the bananas first. I just squeezed them while they were still in the peel to soften them up, then I added them to the bowl and used the electric mixer. I will definitely be making this again. It's a great way to get rid of the bananas that are about to go bad. Thanks for the recipe!","This recipe is pretty close to my Mom's Yummy Banana Bread recipe.  The changes are 3 bananas, 2 cups flour (we use whole wheat), 1\/2 teaspoon baking soda.  I also make mine into 4 mini loaf pans baking at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes.  My girls love this for a snack.  We usually eat one loaf at a time and freeze the rest, so it is fresh.  We also toast our banana bread, so it is like just out of the oven.  Thanks for the idea on that one Uncle Pat.  Excellent recipe!!!  Thanks for posting.","I have tried many recipes for Banana Bread, and by far this was the yummiest!! :-)  Super easy and the texture was perfect. I put it in 2 mini loaf pans.  baked at 350 for 40 mins.  Thanks for sharing!","Spectacluar recipe! Adding one and half tablespoon of brown sugar and letting the batter sit for about 20 mins (thanks chef 307501) took the recipe over the top. Since I got this recipe, I have making this bread every week. Thanks for posting.","For some reason, I thought it was too sweet. Maybe I will bring it down to 3\/4 cup sugar next time. Other than that, it was delicious!!","I agree with the title, it is by far the best banana bread I have ever had! I substituted whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips, and it came out just perfect.  I think next time I will try adding some brown sugar as some are suggesting...","Great recipe!  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg for a little spice.  Turned out wonderful and very moist.","This recipe is great!  I added the cinnamon and nutmeg as Lizzie Lou suggested, I also added 1\/4 C of chopped walnuts, a 1\/4 C raisins, and about a 1\/2 C of Appletons Dark Jamaican Rum... I added a little more flour and a tsp of baking powder to compensate.  MMMMMMM  and I baked it in a bundt pan. It turned out super moist and absolutly wonderful!","I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup of bran plus added a 1.5 cups of chocolate chips.  It is an excellent recipe, definately a keeper!","What a wonderful banana bread. It was exactly what i was looking for. My bananas could have been more black but it still had great flavor i waited the twenty minutes like suggested. I also added some walnuts to it . wonderful","I had extra bananas in the house and decided to give this recipe a try since my kids don't like nuts.  It was easy & quick.  I thought it made enough for 2 small loaf pans, and I was right. I made one, which is great, and froze the other for Thanksgiving.\n\nThanks to lkadlec for sharing:)","Very good.  This is the first bread I ever made, and it turned out great.  it would have been even better if I had used softer bananas and added some chocolate chips.","Awesome bread!  Great Texture, Flavor.  Took 2 loaves to a women's retreat and they could not get enough!  I finally tried it myself to see what all the fuss was about and WOW!  Remeniscent of what Grandma used to make!  Thank You for your easy, flavorful recipe.  A definate keeper.","This was so good! I only had 3 bananas and I added crushed walnuts. 60 minutes was to long in my oven, so I will cut to 50 min. next time I make this. Rich flavor, easy recipe. Loved it! Thanks.","Yummy! These were perfect, not gummy and sticky like some other recipes I've tried.\nI made 12 muffins and baked them for 18 minutes.  Here are some changes I made:\n- only used 3 bananas\n- added 1\/2 tsp of cinnamon\n- substituted Splenda for 1\/3 of the sugar\n- added about 5 very finely crushed walnuts\n- spinkled a cinnamon sugar topping on before baking.","Outstanding. Easy, quick, and most of all...delicious. I doubled it and made two loaves, (because I had a lot of bananas) and it's a good thing I did. Thank you.","Wow- so amazing!  My husband even said that he never had banana bread this good! I will never use another recipe again!\nI did everything as directed, but I did add cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.\nSensational and absolutely delicious! THANK YOU!!","This is a simple, sure-fire recipe for banana bread. What great flavor! For extra flavor and texture, I added a topping to the crust:  crushed pecans (walnuts would be good, too) and brown sugar.  No need to measure for the topping.  Just sprinkle it evenly over the top of the batter and bake as usual.","Wow!!!  Easy & the tastiest banana bread I have ever had!  I threw everything into my big mixer including the sliced banana.  It mashed it up very well.  And threw in the whole eggs.  I followed someone else's recommendation & let the mixure sit in the pan for about 20 before putting it in the oven.  Yummy!!!!   I will be making again, and again!","I triple loves this one just like it is.  The second time I made it I put in 1Tbl. Cinnimon and 3\/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  The family liked it even better!","Oh MY!  I used up my stock of old bananas I had in the freezer and mmmm mmmm mmmmm this was fantastic.\n\nHow I altered this recipe:  \nFirst, I doubled it.  \nI split the sugar:  half turbinado, half granulated.  \nI split the flour:  half whole wheat, half unbleached all-purpose. \nI didn't pre-beat the eggs or pre-crush the bananas.  It all went in the mixer together.\nI added chopped walnuts.\n\nBaked for an hour and turned out beautifully!  Thanks Ikadlec!","I made this for a scrapbooking event and everyone loved it!  I'd never made banana bread before and this was so simple to make.  The bread was very moist.  My kids sampled it and have been bugging me all day to make more!  I added a tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg and also took the advice of another reviewer and left the batter sit for 20 minutes before putting it in the oven.  Heavenly!!","I've tried many banana breads, well over 30 different recipes.  So far this is the VERY best one!  I add a little banana extract to it though if the bananas are not black enough yet.  I have 3 batches baking right now so we have some for breakfast and the rest will go in the freezer to be used later.  Thanks for posting.","What an easy recipe and tastes great too!  I made it lower fat by only using 6 T of butter and added 2 T of applesauce.  My family could not tell the difference!","delicious and buttery! thanks!","I thought this was okay, nothing special. The oven temp and length of time is either too hot or too long. You need to keep an eye on the loaf or it will burn. I added walnuts. My husband ate and he liked it alright.","I thought this was good, but not the best. There is another recipe on this site for Crumb Topped Banana Muffins (#43509) that is much better than the \"best banana bread\" recipe. Obviously, you would just want to take recipe #43509 and put it in a loaf pan instead of muffin tins.","I am surpised to see a few low ratings.  I think this is an AWESOME banana bread recipe and I consider myself a bit of an epicurean especially when it comes to baking.  The flavor is awesome and it's the perfect density.  I would like to try that Crumb topped one suggested below though.  Thanks for this recipe.","i substituted cinnamon for vanilla and cake flour for regular flour, to use what i had on hand. i also used less sugar than called for and super-ripe bananas. even baked in the toaster oven, this turned out awesome! it really tasted like bananas, unlike most other banana breads i've had. recommended ...","This is the best basic banana bread!  I have been searching for a great recipe like this for years.  I add 1\/2 tsp of cinnamon to add a little spice.  I sometimes fold in some dark chocolate chips too.","This is the best and I have tried lots of banana bread recipes.  I have made this twice in 2 days because I didn't get a piece the first time.  DELICIOUS... Thanks for a real keeper.","This bread smelled wonderful cooking and it was so easy to make. I did have one problem though, it browned real fast. I think it might be because I used a dark loaf pan, I will try a different pan next time I make this and believe me I will make it again. It is so delicious I want to eat the whole loaf myself. Thanks for sharing!!","wow!!! This is the best!!! Thanks!","This is the best banana bread I have had!!!  This is one of the first recipes I tried when I found recipezaar and have been making it almost every month!!  I chose this one to try because there were HUNDREDS of positive reviews!!  I have not tried making loaves but can make 2 doz mini muffins in 14 mins or 18 regular sized muffins in 17 mins; I am able to make a batch in the morning befor DH goes to work.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!","this delicious i tried it,\nits very tasty but i think\nyou could use bread flour\ninstead, btw very goood","tasty and very moist.  i will sometimes add walnuts and\/or chocolate chips.","Great Recipe!!!\nNot only did it take 5 min (which is very important for someone like me ,being that i have a 3yr old and 18mth old) to make but it was delicious!!!Came out super moist. The other reviews were right about it not cooking all the way in the middle,for me not a big deal. I just turned off the oven and left it in there untill the oven cooled down.came out perfect. Good Luck!!","This is an awesome banana bread recipe. I made it into muffins and they were so moist and they cooked up great!! No complaints here, thanks for the great recipe!!","good but nothing special.  this recipe is cool because it doesn't require buttermilk which i rarely have on hand.  i think i'll try out the other banana bread recipes after this.  i baked two 3 by 6 loaves and they were toothpick test done in 30 minutes.  UPDATE:  I've decided to downgrade this recipe from a 3 to a 2 because I realized the following few days that I really don't like this banana bread and instead of eating a piece here and there I let it sit and get moldy.  This recipe is really really bla.","It is plain (ie, no nuts, chocolate chips, etc.), but things can be added easily. BUT, it was very moist and yummy....I really enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting!","I really liked this banana bread!\r\nI was worried by some of the reviews so I added recipe #127724 and it was fabulous!\r\nSometimes something simple is a welcome change from all the extras.\r\nSincerely, Jelly :)","I have been trying to find a banana bread recipe that I liked forever and FINALLY found this one.  I love it.  great texture and taste, its perfect!","This bread was good! I was a little skeptical I have to admit because of the lack of spices, but  it was surprisingly simple to put together. But I have to come clean my mom and I added about 1\/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon, a pinch of ground ginger, and about a half a cup of  walnuts. It tastes great... Thanks!","This was my first attempt at making banana bread (banana muffins, actually) and it is THE BEST banana bread\/muffin I've ever tasted - INCREDIBLE!  I chose this recipe because it used 4 bananas, and I had 4 way-over-ripe bananas sitting on my counter after I returned from vacation over the Memorial Day long weekend.  Plus, it had some great reviews.  I made the recipe exactly as directed, except I poured the batter into a muffin tin rather than a loaf pan.  This made 18 muffins for me.  I baked them for 23 minutes at 375*F.  Just delicious!  Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe - one that I will use again and again!","Absolutely, bar none, THE BEST banana bread I have ever had.  Thank you for posting.","This is the best banana bread I ever made.  My 2yr and 5yr old kept asking for more.  I only had 3 bananas but they were a nice size, but the outcome was still good, thanks for a gret recipe, I will definately be making this again, in fact I'm not going to use any other banana bread recipe.  If it isn't broke don't fix it.","Kudos to lkadlec! I'm a banana bread addict and this is by far the best banana bread recipe I've tried! My husband is constantly adking for me to make it again and again now! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!","So, sooooo tasty!  I am definitely filing this away!","I have been making this recipe many times and I haven't got the chance to write a review till now. Everyone who tasted this banana cake loved it. My brother-in-law even calls it The Best Banana Cake Ever Period! I followed what others said and added walnuts and it turned even better! Thanks for sharing this Ikadlec!","This was so awesome!  Will definitly make again!","This is a great recipe.  Very moist and very easy.  I added chocolate chips to mine.","This is a gread banana bread recipe...my husband said he couldn't stop eating it!  I changed the recipe a bit...I replaced the 1 cup of white sugar called for with 1\/2 cup white sugar and 1\/2 cup brown sugar, also I added 1\/2 cup raisins and 1\/2 cup chopped walnuts.  It was delicious!!","This really is the best banana bread that I've made in a long while : ) It has a nice, moist texture and is loaded with banana flavor! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough of it! Next time I will definitely double the recipe and perhaps add some chocolate chips for fun.","Very good. the whole family like it.","Pure heaven is all I can say!  It is very similar to a recipe I have called Bermuda banana bread shown on a decorative cutting board I purchased there over 30 years ago.  This version is better.  My very slight alterations are that I used \"brownulated\" light brown sugar and doubled the vanilla measurement to 1 full teaspoon.  Another reviewer mentioned covering the pan with foil & cutting a slit all the way down the middle to prevent the edges from over-browning - a very good tip which worked!","Awesome! I made some for myself and shared it with my co-workers and they were gone in less than an hour. I should've made more.","Wow! What a great recipe. I think I finaly found the perfect banana bread.\r\nThank you!","Awesome.  Great recipe.  I modified it to be Banana Nut Bread.  I added 1\/2 tsp nutmeg, 1\/2 tsp cinnamon & 4 oz. chopped walnuts.  It's great either way.  Thanks for posting.","I cooked this the first time for a little over an hour in a loaf pan and the edges all came out great but the middle was still a little mushy, so I tried it again because the part that was cooked was soooo good only I made muffins and they turned out awesome, best banana recipe I've ever tried.","This is the easiest banana bread recipe.  My daughter made it for a 4H project and got 2nd place.","I can't believe I have not rated this yet-AWESOME!!!  My Grandma used to make the BEST banana bread, unfortunately, she's past but the memory of the bread still lives on, and this recipe is a very very close running to tasting the same.  My mom and I have been searching for years to find one that compares and finally we found it in this recipe-thank you.  The only difference I make, which my Grandma did, is put black walnuts in it.  Thanks again-you've brought back some great memories!","A lovely recipe. I made it exactly as specified except I lined the pan in cooking paper AND, most importantly, I cooked it for 30 minutes and then covered the bread pan with foil and continued cooking. Perfect!","Very good! I add nutmeg, cinnimon and walnuts. Like another reviewer I tent the bread with foil after the first 30 min.","I tried this with chocolate chips, yummm! It was pretty rich, but very delicious.","This is \"THE\" recipe for banana bread. You can add some nuts to it or some chocolate chips and it still comes out perfect! YUMMY!","Good, moist. I love the 4 bananas idea. Cooked for 60 minutes, it still wasn't done in the middle. I will make it again.","Yum! Just ate it fresh from the oven, and my 2 yr old is also devouring it! This si what I did different- I used nonfat yogurt instead of butter,  3\/4 cups sugar, only had 3 bananas but they were well over ripe, I used half whole wheat flour and half white and that worked out great! They loaf seemed a little dense but once I tasted it, it was great! Ive never made BB and this turned out really good! I think with the whole wheat flour, it helped alot that I sprinkled some brown sugar and cinnamon on top before baking- SO GOOD with that topping! Yum. 50 minutes did it in my oven and left it nice and moist! Next time I'll probably cut down on the sugar as it was very sweet and hopefully I can get away with less sugar. Thanks !","EXCELLENT!! Turns out great every time. The whole family loves it. Top seller at bake sales too! Followed the recipe exactly.","This was a crowd pleaser!  I accidently used baking powder instead of soda and it still turned out ok.  Thank you!  It was super yummy!","these are sooo good! I made them with my nieces and they had a blast making them.. The only things I changed were the bananas, instead of 4 I used 3; and i also baked these in a muffin tin. it made 12 muffins and I baked them at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes (until a toothpick comes out clean).","Simple yet delish.  My 4 and 5 years old daughters enjoyed helping out with this treat.  We used margarine in place of butter and baked it 15 to 20 minutes less than the time given in the recipe for that cake-like softness.  Thank you so much for sharing.","I love this recipe for bana bread it is very moist and yummy. I don't make mine with nuts as I'm not a fan but I'm sure if you added about 1\/2 cup it would work well!","This was super simple. After putting it in the loaf pan I let it sit for a while and rest before putting it in the oven.","Yummy.  I just made this (had to half it because I only had 2 bananas), and it was an instant hit.  I couldn't wait until it cooled down, and ended up squashing the top =(","I took one look at the too full pan and the sloppy wet batter, and thought oh, man...this is going to be very soggy in the center.  Too much banana, I thought.  (My 4 bananas were pretty big).  Not enough flour, I thought.   Let me tell you... I was wrong!  Perfect.  Moist, excellent texture throughout.  Delicious!","excellent! moist and tasty. I had 5 ripe bananas left so I added one more and an equivalent amount of flour to compensate a little. The pan was filled to the brim, a little soft in the center when it was done, but I let it sit and it settled up and was the BEST banana bread I've ever had! I could actually taste the banana!","WOW! \nI made muffins using this recipe and they were DELICIOUS!\nI used big bananas and baked the muffins for just over 25 minutes. Despite my expired baking soda, they were perfect!","so good!!!","I just made this bread yesterday.  It is delicious!!!  My pregnant daughter couldn't stay out of it.  Super easy recipe.  I think I'll add walnuts next time.","I really liked the consistency of the bread, not as oily as some other banana breads I've had, but next time I make this, I'll be adding chopped walnuts or some cinnamon, but this is a great basic banana bread recipe. Thanks!","this banana bread is super moist! and easy to make. by far the best banana bread ive ever made! thanks for sharing this recipe!","Got several thumbs up for this bread!  I am not usually any good at making banana bread - this was easy enough for even me to not mess up.  Thanks for posting!","This was DEELICIOUS! We absolutely devoured the thing--51 minutes at 350 in a convection oven was perfect.  I used 3 ripe bananas and 6 super ripe mini bananas--I think the mini bananas added a bit of sweetness that was excellent! I also added a few shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg, and used brown sugar instead of white....we'll be making this weekly! (or, daily at this rate!) Thanks for the awesome recipe, lkadlec!","I have made this bread on numerous occasions, my b\/f went for a fishing trip with the guyz, I made 2 loaves, (easily done, doubling the recipe) they arrived Friday afternoon and the bread was gone Saturday morning!!!! Was definately a hit, my Son just came home from B.C. and the recipe is on the fridge he said \"Best Banana Bread?\", well I made it and he is a believer!!!  I tend to cut the sugar to about 1\/2 cup and have added raisins and even up to 6 bananas and the results are always amazing.  Truly is THE BEST BANANA BREAD very forgiving and easily adaptable.  Thanks again for a Keeper!!!","Very good bread. It was much better than my wife's recipe. Of course she wouldn't admit it. The kids and I ate it all in one sitting. Will definetly make it again!!","I give this a 4 out of 5 because although it tasted great, the texture was a bit oily for us. It seemed almost too moist. If I try this again, I'll be sure to use either 3\/4 or 1\/2 the amount of butter. I did add some walnuts and that could have made it oilier due to the oil that seeps from the nuts. So, to be fair I'll have to try this without nuts next time. But, overall the taste was great!","I've made at least a dozen different recipes before, and this really is the best I've ever made. My husband thought so too. He normally wants to put butter on it, but after his first piece, he decided it didn't need any! I put in 1 cup white flour and 1\/2 cup whole wheat.","Absolutely fantastic!!!! Best banana bread I've ever tasted (and I've tasted quite a lot!) Thank you sooooooo much for sharing!","Very moise and delicious.  I used very ripe bananas and added a handful of walnuts.  This made three nice sized mini loaves.  Yummy.  Thanks for posting.","We've baked this recipe several times and each time it's perfect. So easy and for some reason tastes better than any other recipe we've ever tried. Now a fixture in out cookbook.","i made this today, and everyone in my family loved it! even though i was a banana short it still came out really good. i put chocolate chips in it too :)","This banana bread is absolutely deliscious!!!  The first time I made it as stated but now I switch out the flour for 3\/4 c rye flour & 3\/4 c whole wheat flour, splenda for the sugar and added chopped pecans.  What a wonderful recipe...and so easy.  Thanks for sharing.","I could NOT get to the computer fast enough to review this mouth-watering and delicious banana bread recipe! Hands down, for a simple\/basic recipe, it is hands & shoulders above ANY banana bread recipe that I've ever made...and that is saying A LOT! I collect b.b. recipes like other women collect shoes and for the most part, they are very good. But, this weekend, I refused to go to the store to pick up \"sour cream, chocolate chips, nuts, blahblahblah\" that so many other recipes require. I wanted a BASIC no-frills recipe that turned out a stunning loaf: that's not asking too much, is it?  So, How.Good.Was.It??? The 1st batch was gone in 22 minutes: some of the kids even had to blow on them to cool them down! The 2nd batch, the little scamps will have to wait until after supper! The 1st time I made it per the recipe; the 2nd time I upped the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and 1\/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I will be making THIS recipe as my default banana bread recipe from now on!!!! Thank you for sharing this with us; it's stellar! :)","I am not leaving any stars until I try this again. I also used a nonstick pan and watched it very carefully. I could see it was getting too brown but a toothpick inserted in the center showed it was still gooey. I took it out 5 minutes early, but by then the bottom and sides were more done than I wanted.  Not sure how to solve this unless I make mini loaves.","This was gone before I knew it.  My family loved this.  Very  moist and I got 2 loaves out of it and one of the loaves had mini chocolate chips in there and it was really good.  I will be making this again today and trying to freeze a little of it.  Thanks for the great recipe.","This is now my go-to banana bread recipe. I've made it a few times now and it always turns out yummy and moist.","I have tried a number of banana bread recipes and this one is the best! I made this exactly as directed-all in the kitchenaid.\r\nI uses a williams and sonoma harvest loaf pansprayed with \"non-stick spray for baking\"\r\nIt came out awesome!!!\r\nThanks Ikadlec","This banana bread recipe is superb!  Very moist and delicious!  I made banana bread muffins and baked them for 20 minutes and that was perfect!  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1\/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1 cup walnuts.  My husband said it is the best that he's ever eaten.  I also took some to co-workers and they were amazed at how good these are.  I will definitely be making these again and again......","Wow - absolutely delicious! Definitely one of the best banana breads I've tasted. I also liked how quick it was to throw together. This is a definite keeper - thanks for sharing!","This was a VERY simple recipe and I didn't have to go buy anything for it. Don't be fooled by it simplicity. This banana bread is one of the best I've had and VERY moist. It was a HUGE hit both at home & the office!","This is a Great Recipe!","Very easy, very good!  I make muffins and put them in for 20 minutes and my 19 month old devours them.  Just a sprinkle of cinnamon and a little extra vanilla for me...","I am very good at screwing up baking but this recipe was to good to be true and verrry easy! 5 stars for everything! Thanks for your help!!","outside was perfect inside was completely doughey.  Should be covered with foil!!","Awesome.  SO MOIST! Baked for 60 minutes and cooked to perfection! Thank you!","Unbelievably yummy bread for not having any fancy ingredients like heavy whipping cream or buttermilk or whatnot.  Simple and great!","This is really great banana bread.  The recipe is really easy, and it came out really well, lovely dark brown crust, moist inside and great banana flavour.  I was worried that it wouldn't come out because my oven can have problems with bigger baked goods like bread and cakes but it was perfect.  Will make again for sure!  There is a reason that this has so many great reviews!","Great recipe1 Although with 4 bananas it was really wet when done, I may try with less banana next time. All in all great tasting!","This is a terrific recipe!  I usually only add 3 banana's and I really liked the taste and moister texture change the 4th banana added.  Thx. for posting!","Made this around the holidays and it has excellent moist flavor.  I even tried a lowfat version of this with the egg substitute and light margarine and it still came out tasting wonderful.  I am adding this to my collection.  Thanks for posting it!","Half way through baking time, I realized I had forgotten the vanilla ;(\r\nBut, it was still really yummy! Great recipe. Thanks for sharing :)","Soooooo good! I set my timer for 55 minutes and was glad I did. Not sure if it's my stupid oven's fault, but I fear that if I left it another 5 minutes, burning results would follow. Such a simple recipe provided the yummiest banana bread I've ever consumed. BRILLIANT!","Very good. I only had 3 bananas and I didn't have vanilla. I added a little nutmeg and some chopped pecans. I checked it after 55 minutes and it was done. Hubby said it was good. Recipe seems to be adaptable to what you have and still come out good.","Fantastic recipe!  The bread was very moist and flavorful.  I also added walnuts to mine.  Thank you for posting!","This is the best banana bread recipe that I have ever tried.  The whole family just loved it.  Thank you for sharing!!!","I don't even like bananas but I love this! The whole family like it and I've got another batch (doubled!) in the oven at the moment!\r\nThank you for a great recipe.","I really loved I am not sure the difference in 4 stars or 5. It was moist, flavorful, done in 50 minutes. I added Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Walnuts and decreased butter to 1\/3 cup as another review said it was too greasy and used 1\/2 sugar & 1\/2 brown sugar. Nice to have a basic recipe in which I don't need to go to the store to buy an ingredient","I only had three (very ripe) bananas. turned out perfect.","Outstanding recipe...I added 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips to the final mixture. Friends all want this recipe.","Not as if it needs another review. I sprinkled chopped walnuts on before baking and it came out perfect.","The bread was awesome! My family loved it. Followed the recipe, didn't change anything. Thanks so much!","I like this recipe very much. It was very moist and the kids absolutely wanted more. I added walnuts and that made it all the better. Thank you!","This was a very good and easy banana bread recipe.  I used a glass loaf dish, which may have contributed to it being a little more well done (bottom 1\/2\" was browner than rest of loaf). Very tasty - thanks!","Seems to burn in my gas oven if I bake for the full sixty minutes. I go about 45. Best banana bread I have ever had and I have tried many varieties. This recipe is used over and over. It keeps well for several days as well.","i made it with 1\/4 cup butter, 1\/4 cup vegetable oil, and 2 TB of milk--cut back on saturated fats a bit. worked just fine!","Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  I have made it many times now. I usually double the recipe and add 2-3 cups of chopped walnuts.   It always comes out moist and delicious.","I'm dubious that letting the batter stand before baking (Chef #307501) increases the banana flavor; when the bananas are pureed to begin with and then baked for an hour, all their flavor is going to permeate the bread anyway.  (Moreover, letting a baking-powder-based batter stand before baking can dissipate the rising power.)  There are better ways of getting more banana flavor.  One is to use overripe bananas: their skins should be black all over, past the speckled stage, and the flesh inside should be soft, sticky, and somewhat golden.  Or, simply use more bananas: the standard proportions are 4 medium bananas to 2 cups of flour, but the bananas can be increased by 50% without throwing off the other ingredients.  And competing flavors should be avoided; vanilla tends to tone down fruitiness, and lemon rind (as in \"Joy of Cooking\") is ridiculous.","I had 3 overripe bananas that I need to use so I looked here and found this recipe.  I only used the 3 bananas I had and it still worked fine.  I also added chopped pecans to mine (since that is what I had in the pantry).  My husband and I LOVED it!  I will make this one again and agian!  Thanks!!!","I'm not sure WHY this recipe is so good... but it really is. Maybe because it calls for 4 banana's instead of only 2-3? Try it... you won't be sorry.","This bread turns out great, it's a simple and easy recipe to follow.  I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar and it was still moist and delicious.  I will probably use less sugar next time as it was already so sweet from the bananas.","I made this last night and it wasn't until I was taking it out of the oven that I realized I forgot to add the eggs.  I went ahead and tasted it anyhow.  Between my husband and I, we demolished that loaf.  I baked 2 more loaves today, this time WITH the eggs.  After tasting both batches, my husband decided he liked it better withOUT the eggs.  It left the inside with a doughier texture yet it was thoroughly cooked.  (It did take longer to bake though.)  This recipe is a keeper!","This banana bread is excellent.  In case you are short on bananas, I've used it with 3 bananas with no problems.  I find that I usually have to bake it for an extra 10 minutes (i.e., 70 minutes total) to make sure it is cooked all the way through -- but then again, I usually add one cup of chocolate chips to the recipe :)  Highly recommended, you can't go wrong with this recipe.","Plain and simple - DELISH!!!!","I've made this several times following the recipe exactly and it is really moist and delicious!","SOOO easy, tasted wonderful too! thanks, i usually hate making banana brea cause it is too complicated and time consuming. \n\nThanks for sharing!","My hubby is the household banana-bread-making-expert. He thinks this is awesome, and will make no other banana bread.  I agree that it is tasty.","This was my first time making banana bread and it is the bomb!!! it came out great!! thanx recipezaar!!!","This makes great banana bread.  I made these in 5 mini loaf pans.  It only took 30 minutes to bake and they turned out wonderful.  Thank you for posting.","I am now the banana bread pro in my family! All because of this recipe! Sooo delicious and so easy!","Currently making this again.  I am so happy to find a recipe that didn't require buttermilk!  It turned out fluffy and not heavy like most recipes I've used.  Thanks!","This recipe is AMAZING! It came out so moist and had the perfect crust.  My husband loved it and has requested more! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!","I used three bananas and two jars of banana baby food was only gonna use one jar but my 5 year insisted we had to put both jars in. also realized halfway through i didn't have baking soda since we just moved and everything that was in the fridge at old house got thrown away. So I substituted 1tsp baking soda for 3 tsp baking powder since that's what my cookbook says under substitutes. Also I did muffins. Which they were still really good even with all the stuff i did.","I made this in accordance with the recipe with the exception that I used 3 bananas instead of 4. I received A TON of compliments on the moistness and taste. I made 1\/2 the batch with walnuts and the other 1\/2 without nuts. I made muffins to take to the office (instead of a loaf). Anytime a banana is in risk of going bad, I stick it in the freezer for this recipe! The recipe is definitely a keeper!","WHOLY BANANAS! This is the BEST banana bread I have EVER made and I have made banana bread many times. I doubled the batch and used I cup ww flour and 2 cups white flour. I also cut out 1 cup of sugar and it was SUPER moist. So glad I chose this recipe over the top one.","This was my first attempt at making banana bread. THIS WAS REALLY GOOD! I'll be adding nuts next time only because I like them. but other than that, I wouldn't change anything. ITS GREAT!","I really loved this banana bread the best, I have tried the other recipes but this one was absolutely the best, I added more bananas in it and loved it, it had such a great taste, this is my tenth time making it since my friends all love it! Thank you!","So far this is the \"Best Banana Bread\".  I have made others and my husband doesn't like it as much as this recipe.  Easy to make and EVERYONE loves this bread..even my picky eater friends.","I am not a big fan of bananas but I had some lying around that I wasnt sure what to do with. Im so happy I found and used this recipe bc it rocks! I only had 3 bananas but the bread was still really moist and really great tasting. Definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing!","EXCELLENT--truly the \"BEST\".  30 years of searching for the best taste, moistness, and easy recipe is finally over.  This is in my personal cook book for ever.  I did add some coconut, fresh grated nutmeg and some cinnamon for an added kick that pleased by personal food critic, hubby.  Thanks so much for sharing.","The texture was okay, not quite as moist as I would have liked. Maybe an extra banana would have helped. The flavor was so so, didn't really have that banana bread taste for me.","Yummy, simple, and perfect. I followed all of the directions except I accidentally added 1\/2 tsp too much salt (oops!). It still turned out amazing. I baked four mini loafs for 35-40 minutes. One of the loafs was gone about 10 minutes after they finished baking...","Let's just say that I will never use another banana bread recipe again. This is sooo yummy. I love it!","I added one more banana, and toasted walnuts.  Other than that, a really good bread.  Also try honey-eyed butter for dipping!","This was by far the BEST banana bread recipe I ever made!  I was lazy and didn't sift the dry ingredients and it had no adverse effect on the outcome. I also added 1\/2 t. cinnamon and swirled some walnuts in on top as an afterthought. The result was super moist and extremely flavorful. I have now replaced my \"favorite\" recipe with this one for sure! Thank you!","My fiance loves this banana bread. And it is super easy to make.","This really is the best banana bread I have tried. I find myself buying extra bananas now just so I have extras to make this recipe. YUMMY!!!!","This is one of the best banana bread I made.  It's very moist and the taste is amazing.  I used only 1\/2 cup of sugar.  I baked it 20 minutes more.  Thanks ikadlec :)  Made for I Recommend tag game","I'm trying to get the recipe to try it.  Can't say how good it is.","This was a very tasty banana bread. It was easy to make. I didn't find it to be anything exceptional- it was very good, just not anything better than any other banana bread that I've made. Would I make it again? Yes. Though I would probably add some choppsed walnuts for texture.","This was so easy! Good, too. Kids like this better than banana banana bread, which is my favorite. Used 2 frozen, 2 overripe and microwaved to make them really mushy. Should have floured the pan in addition to the Pam.","This is a no fail recipe for banana bread.  It is excellent.  What I did to make it a little healthier was I substituted applesauce for the butter and it came out really moist.  If you want a great snack I would definately recommend this recipe.  Thanks lkadle","I loved how high this banana bread rose. It was very moist and the banana flavor was nice and strong. I would probably eliminate one banana next time so the bread wouldn't be as moist. I like mine a little bit drier (personal preference). Thanks!","This is fantastic!  I used applesauce instead of butter, whole wheat flour instead of white, cut the sugar in half, and doubled the recipe.  I made muffins instead of a loaf (couldn't find my loaf pan!) and they still turned out great.  I cooked the muffins for about 25 minutes, and sprayed the papers with Pam (otherwise, the crust sticks to the paper).  Even with all those changes, they came out dense but moist, with a wonderful not-too-sweet banana flavor.  Great recipe!","Oh my goodness, this may be the best banana bread I've ever made or eaten!  I did use 1\/4 cup applesauce in place of half the butter and I used half white and half brown sugar and added 1\/2 tsp cinnamon.  I baked it in two aluminum bread pans for 50 min.  I let them rest for 10 min. after removing them from the oven, then got them out of the pans and cooled on a rack.  I then ate half a loaf and am thinking about going back for more.  It is SO Good!!!!","I will never try another banana bread recipe because this one is the BEST!  I used four very ripe bananas (many freckles) and added a 1\/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  I divided the batter into two smaller foil pans and baked for about 35-40 minutes.  It is very moist and cake like with great banana flavor.  Thanks!","I am new to making banana breads.  I baked it like directed and it got dry and didn't raise hardly at all.   The flavor was great tho.  Next time I will watch it and take it out of the oven sooner.","I have made numerous versions of banana bread and I really like this one! I like to add a sprinkle of brown sugar on the top before baking...really adds a little extra without being too sweet...thanks so much for the recipe. I actually make these as muffins.","Easy and delectable.  What more could you ask for in a recipe.  We always add walnuts as that what my kids and husband prefer.  One bowl kitchen aid boom done!!!","I love it!!! It's so moist and yummy. I'm definately NOT a baker but found this recipe to be simple and very easy taking only a few minutes to throw everything together. I added a 1 tsp of Cinnamon and replaced the regular sugar with brown sugar and it was so flavourful.  My husband loves it and Thank you so much for sharing this recipe I give it 5 stars!!!","This made a very nice bread.  To cut back on the fat and calories by just a little bit, I reduced the sugar to 3\/4 cups and I substituted 3 tbsp of butter with apple sauce.  Because my bananas were on the small side, I got a fluffy bread.  It wasn't overly moist (though it wasn't dry either).  I would say it had the consistency of cake.  I will likely be turning to this one again.","I was looking for a banana bread recipe like my Mom and I've found it! It's very simple and so easy to make. I love that have a good recipe to use when I've got bananas to use up!","I fixed it exactly as written.  I was AMAZING!","Simple recipe, excellent banana bread.  By far a favorite in our house.  I've started making them into muffins instead - makes about 16. I cook them for about 20-25 minutes. And I put in about a half cup of wheat flour (the rest, white flour).","Delicious! Great texture and just enough sweet. I may add another banana and I did add cinnamon. Yum!","I thought this recipe was very good - but not perfect enough for 5 stars.  It seemed to be missing something, but I am not sure what.  I ended up checking the bread with a toothpick at one hour of cooking and it was very runny in the center, so I added 5 minutes to the cook time.  I took it out then (65 minutes) and the bottom and edges were a little too done for me (very dark brown).  I will be making this again and will definitely take it out at 60 minutes even if the center does not seem done, as it will continue to cook once it's out of the oven.","I have made this bread 3 times an I love it.  I substitute margarine and Splenda and it only needs to cook 45 minutes (at sea level).  Make sure to spray the top of the dough with cooking spray before placing in the oven when using Splenda to make sure it browns.","This is a great recipe. I just made a double batch last night. The couple things I tweaked were, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I added a half cup of sour cream. Very yummy!!","I found this recipe about 2 years ago and have made it countless times.  Everywhere I bring it I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  The best was when my 7 year old nephew says to me \"This is the best banana bread I've ever had!\"  I usually use 5 bananas instead of 4 because I love dense, moist breads.  And the key to a really good banana bread is using black bananas.  So when bananas go bad I stick them in my freezer and wait til I have enough to make a loaf.  I even made a gluten free loaf once with rice flour and it was still delicious and moist.  I will never use another banana bread recipe!","My Gramma would slap me for posting this...but when I didn't have brown sugar to make her recipe, I looked on here for one that didn't call for brown sugar. Found this one and made it. FABULOUS! <br\/>(shhh... I liked it better than the old family one)","For me, a good recipe has got to have good flavor and all, but for my lifestyle, it's got to also be quick and easy. This banana bread is excellent. It also kept very well in the refrigerator for a week.","This is really good bread.","This Banana Bread is the most delicious banana bread i ever had.Only thing i did different was added 1\/2 teaspoon of each cinnamon,allspice and nutmeg.It is so moist and delicious.","Its easy to make and it tastes great. Super moist and tons of banana flavor.","Wonderful recipe, have made it several times and always a hit! Needs to bake for about 5 more mins for me, also much better if don't melt the butter before creaming (although I guess this is a general rule.) Added chopped dried apricots.","Perfect banana bread!  I made small changes by using 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 1\/2 tsp and added walnuts. I have used several recipes in the past and they do not compare to this recipe. Very moist and full of banana flavor!  We will definitely use this recipe from now on.","I made 7 small loaves with this recipe for a bake sale.  I replace the butter with canola and added cinnamon, allspice and cloves.  Good texture, good bread.","Very good! Toothsome with a great slightly-chewy texture. I made as is, only adding a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger to pep things up a bit. <br\/><br\/>Next time I think I'll use olive oil instead of butter, split the sugar half white and half brown and maybe replace 1\/2 cup of the flour with toasted ground almond meal.<br\/><br\/>Thanks Ikadlec for such a great basic banana bread master recipe, it's delicious as is and will be fun to vary with add-ins in future batches.","Well although I'm going to tweak this a little I still think it's damn good just the way it is!  This is the best banana bread recipe I've come across in a long time.  Super easy to make, the flavor is incredible and the texture is perfect!  If it weren't for the calories I wouldn't change it.  But I think I can get away with using 1\/2 the butter and maybe using 1\/2 the sugar.  I see some of you used brown sugar for a healthier change but I don't think that matters much since sugar is sugar no matter the color.   And I might try browning the butter a bit first to try and get a more intense flavor.     <br\/>I made this exactly the way explained and baked it for precisely 60 minutes in a ceramic bread pan.  The results were perfect%u2665","I originally tried this recipe because it did not call for brown sugar which I was out of and was pleasantly surprised. Best banana bread I've ever made. I used 4 bananas.","I didn't have my usual banana bread recipe with me and found this one during my frantic search. I cooked it in a cast iron pan in hot coals and it turned out prrfectly! This is my new favorite recipe and my two brothers and my boyfriend can't get enough of it! Thank you.","This banana bread recipe is the best one I have come across.  Thank you very much for posting this wonderful recipe.","Simply the BEST banana bread I've ever made!  I'd been using the recipe Banana Banana Bread from all recipes and wanted something with better flavor and texture, this banana bread is everything I want it to be.  My son LOVES it!  THANK YOU!!","I took this recipe for banana bread to church last night, and had several people tell me it was the best they had ever eaten. Indeed it was for me too. I put this recipe in my personal cookbook. I did add a cup of chopped pecans to the recipe. It's the BEST.","Moist delicious and sliced very well especially when cold. I substituted margarine for the butter and used 1\/2 cup castor and 1\/2 cup brown sugar. Would definitely make again.","Easy and perfect as is. Thanks for sharing.","Thank you.  Now I'm done.  I have baked a whole heap of banana bread in my years and had some great recipes.  Still, even though I liked them, I kept looking.  My search ended today.  My kids agree, the dog agrees, my husband doesn't like banana bread so he has no vote.  This is IT!  Moist, easy to put together, no oddball ingredients, flavorful to the tenth power.  I added walnuts because that's a preference, but it would be just as good without.  Thank you for this recipe sure to be passed down in my family for years to come.  Fan freakin tastic!","Liked this banana bread! Liked the amount of bananas used in this recipe. The best part about this recipe is the amount of time it took to make and have in the oven! I think it took about 8 or 10 minutes and it was baking. I have a good banana recipe that I like, but the prep seems to take much longer. Will make again for sure! ( a tip about mashing bananas--I like to use a potato masher in a glass pie pan--it really speeds things up, and is easy to clean up!)","This is a FANTASTIC recipe!!  Very easy to follow and it produces an incredibly moist banana bread.  It lasted a day and a half in our house!!","Best banana bread I have ever made. Just for some pizzazz I added some natural sugar crystals to the top. I will never again look for another recipe!","Baked as directed. Toothpick came out clean however when I cut into it the middle remained uncooked. I had to toss the entire thing. A waste of time and ingrediants.","This was by far the best banana bread I've ever had. Moist and delicious!","have made this twice now...good stuff! i never seem to have brown sugar in the house, so i like that this one doesnt call for it","In one word, \"Yum\". I added a 1\/8  cup of oats and the same amount of rolled oats. I also used whole wheat flour.  It had a moisture and texture that was perfect.","This is a fantastic Banana Bread recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and would not change a thing.  Definitely making this again. It's a keeper for sure.","I have to agree with the other 439 reviewers - This is the Perfect Banana Bread.  Not too sweet with the proper balance of banana to flour to make the best texture.  I did add 1 cup of well chopped walnuts to this recipe.  This recipe is truly exceptional!","I agree - this is the best banana bread recipe - easy to make and the entire family loves it.","Great and simple.<br\/>I replaced the butter with apple sauce. I used whole wheat flour. Delicious banana bread.

I used my new Pampered Chef pan with the 12 squares instead of making a large loaf.  Cooked it for 30 minutes. Perfect!","I had 2 very large bananas and needed to make something. This was an easy recipe and I just added about 1\/3 cup of nuts and 1\/4 cup of chocolate chips. This was wonderful and made the house smell delicious. Thank you this will be the go to recipe for sure.","Amazing!!! Moist and delicious! I have been looking for a good recipe and have finally found it!!","Awesome recipe!! Highly recommended!","Great recipe!  I never made banana bread from scratch before but since I was forced to go gluten free mixes were no longer an option.  This recipe is wonderfully simple and delicious.  I use cup4cup as a gluten free flour replacement and it comes out great!  It's nice finally being able to bake something my whole family loves which is tough when baking without gluten.  Adding some walnuts and\/or chocolate chips makes it to die for.  I'll be making it for the fourth time this week once the bananas are ready.","This recipe is moist and delicious.","This is a great recipe!  So easy and quick to prep too.  I used 3 large ripened bananas and added roughly between 1\/2 - 3\/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The edges came out a little on the crunchy side and the inside was so moist!  Thank you for sharing!","I turned this into a uber healthy version, and it turned just as good, if not better!<br\/>I replace the butter with Coconut Oil (unrefined, virgin), i replaced the white flour with spelt flour, and the sugar with pure maple syrup.  Still do delicious, and guilt free.","This was the best recipe! It turns out beautiful, so moist, full of flavor, easy to make and just so delicious!

I added walnuts, chocolate chips and coconut flakes. I will be making this over and over","this is seriously the best banana bread ever!!","Awesome banana bread, now i make this all the time with my family. just love how moist it is. it tastes like heaven","This is the most delicious banana bread I have ever tasted it is a favourite in my home","My first time making banana bread and I&#039;m glad I chose this recipe.

Highly recommend.","You are absolutely right.... this is the best banana bread ever ..... so full of taste .... easy to make..... I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.... Thank you for sharing..","Easy   Delicious = Perfection! I told my children they couldn&#039;t have any banana bread until their homework was finished... I can&#039;t believe what an awesome incentive this turned out to be! :) I&#039;m one satisfied mama!","i only had 2 bananas, replaced the butter with applesauce adn added a box of raisins. Cook time needed to be 10 minutes shorter, as I almost burned it, but I will try this again another time.","This is the second time I have used this recipe, and I just had to come back and review it. :) Thank you thank you lkadlec! We added cinnamon and raw crushed almonds for a nice variation of the recipe.","I love this recipie. Moist, easy to make, and always a hit. I added a little cinnamon and was very pleased with the results.","Best recipe I have found. Have been looking for a good one for 4 months and this is it. I added walnuts. Will be using it in the bakery we are opening in Panama in 5 months, Thank you for posting.","You can&#039;t go wrong with this recipe - it comes out so moist every time.  I&#039;ve experimented with this recipe quite a bit and this is what I find works for me.  I add chopped dark chocolate (about 1\/2 cup), 3\/4 cups of chopped walnuts, and about 3\/4 cups of Baker&#039;s shredded coconut (sweetened).  And since there is sugar from the chocolate and coconut, I cut the sugar back to 1\/2 cup.  So gooood!!","wonderful recipe, everyone loved it.","Yummy banana cake. I subtitude butter with vegetable oil and my banana is 1 cup. This turn out great and add time almost 1 hour. Thank you for this recipe","Quick, easy and simply delicious! I didn&#039;t trust that the mixture would all fit into a standard (British) loaf tin and kept some back but it didn&#039;t rise to much and will risk it next time. I&#039;m definitely going to try this with walnuts! Great recipe, thanks!","This recipe was delicious!   A definite keeper.  I added chopped walnuts.   It took longer than sixty minutes to bake though!  Bake it u won&#039;t be disappointed.","Quick and easy to make!  And ever so tasty.  I added walnuts and an extra splash of vanilla, and it was divine.  Made my co-worker do his happy dance when I brought it in to the office.  A definite long time keeper!!","I&#039;ve made this twice EXACTLY as shown in the recipe and it was the BEST I have ever tasted.  We had a side dish of cream cheese icing for those who wanted to spread some on.","I&#039;m not really sure what happened here.  I made exactly according to the directions.  When I went to take the loaf out of the pan, all the liquid poured out through the top of the bread.  I tried to put it back in the oven and cooked it for a total of about an hour and 45 minutes and it still wasn&#039;t done.  Had to toss it.  I&#039;m not sure if it was the glass loaf pan.?.?  I can&#039;t figure out why it didn&#039;t work,","I was looking for a really good recipe that was moist and tastes like bananas. So glad I tried this recipe, simple ingredients are sometimes the best. I live at 6000 ft. so baking is always a challenge. The only thing I changed was the amount of baking soda, I used 3\/4 tsp and it turned out perfect!","Thanks for the amazing recipe!!!! Three days later and its still moist and yummy!","So amazingly delicious! Took this to a friend&#039;s house and they absolutely devoured it and couldn&#039;t stop raving about it.","I have tried countless banana bread recipes in the years since I have been baking.  I have thought I had found the perfect recipe but curious to see if this was indeed the best banana bread.  And the results are that this is IN FACT the BEST banana bread recipe I have EVER tried.  I doubled the recipe using 8 large bananas.  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose flour.   I doubled the vanilla since I love vanilla.  I also added a 2 cups of walnuts to the double recipe batter and sprinkled some additional ones on top of both loaves.  I baked the bread for about 70 minutes in my Breville Smart Oven.  Once removed from the oven I covered tightly with foil and steamed for 30 minutes.  I then removed to a cooling rack to finish cooling.  The bottom stuck ever so slightly in the middle of the pan so next time I will lightly flour the pan after spraying with cooking spray.  The bread was SUPER moist.  It had the most wonderful banana flavor.  The crust was perfectly brown.  I am extremely impressed with this recipe.  It takes a lot to impress me and this recipe definitely impressed me.","Love banana bread! This is definitely the best! I used glass bread pans and so I turned my oven on (25 degrees lower is recommended) 50 degrees lower and cooked it a little longer:) My family loves it, even my son who is very picky said it was the best!","This was a great recipe! I have been searching for a good one trying out about 4 different recipes. It was a great balance of flavours. I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to make it a decadent treat! No need to ever try a different recipe.","I have been searching for a good Banana Bread recipe for over a year, and this is hands down the best Banana Bread I&#039;ve made in at least 15 tries at different recipes. It is so moist and you can really taste the bananas. The others were all so bland and tasting of flour rather than bananas. I added walnuts to mine. This is the only recipe I&#039;ll  use in te future!  The Best!","Easy squeezy! I&#039;m not a baker but this turned out superb. I added chopped (could have been toasted) pecans.and took it to share with my son in Toronto. His comment was &quot;you could sell this on Bloor Street - it&#039;s that good!&quot; Bloor West Village is his place to find specialty and delicious foodstuffs so that was a big compliment. Definitely a recipe I will keep on hand for future compliments. A","Very easy.Very moist added chocolate chis and loved it! My oven is a little too hot so I baked it at 300 degrees for about 45 minutes.","Hands down the BEST recipe for banana bread! :D","Thank you for this simple yet very delicious recipe. I was really amazed how good it came out the first time I baked a loaf. I have been using this recipe for several years now. For variety, sometimes I add a little peanut butter in the batter and other times I add a few chopped pecans or walnuts. I also add nutmeg to the recipe each time. I have used this basic recipe to make pumpkin and sweet potato bread and varying the spices to suit my taste. I find that the main thing is not to overbake.","Geeez:P This is an awesome recipe:) I added pecans and dried cranberries as I love them and it is a heavenly tasty banana bread...I am not a best baker in the world so I am trying to get easy recipes that always work...I tried before another recipe twice and it did not work...I thought it was my lack of baking skills.It was so fatty taste and it was going apart...but this recipe...first time used and it was great success...and so easy to do.....My husband yesterday ate two pieces and I had to literally hide the bread in the fridge...otherwise it would be eaten the same night it was made....And my husband does not have a sweet tooth and does not eat sweets at all.......I just ate another piece and I said I have to write this review...it deserves to be called The Best Banana Bread ever!!! ....","I had been trying so many banana bread recipes. This is the ONLY one you&#039;ll ever need now. It is a simple and delicious recipe.","Love this recipe. I usually end up making this once a week since my toddler stopped eating the bananas I always buy. I usually substitute half the sugar with brown sugar and I spray the pan then coat it with sugar to give it a sweet crunch to the crust. This is an amazing recipe that is always no fail for me.","This recipe is great! My boyfriend and I used this recipe for our banana bread and the result was more than satisfying!","Very easy to make. Taste is great!!!!&lt;br\/&gt;thank you","My son and I are making this recipe right now for the third time! Everyone that we&#039;ve given it to have loved it as well!","Tasty and quick. I subbed coconut oil for butter and it was delicious. I felt a little less guilty eating them.","Best banana bread I have made for a long time. Added an extra egg yolk for some more protein (to make me feel better about the sugar) and half of the sugar I used was brown sugar. Yum!","YUM! This is a great banana bread recipe.. it comes out more like a moist cake then regular banana bread. Only thing I did different was use dark brown sugar instead of regular sugar. This is a recipe to try!","I made this fir my son and he sent a text tha.king me for the yummy banana bread. Easy to make and delicious with walnuts added to it too","I made a few tweaks on this recipe, added cinnamon , 1\/2 ww flour, 1\/2 white flour, added tbsp ground flaxseed, not as much sugar, 3\/4 cup, still sweet and tasty.","I registered for Food.com just so I could review this banana bread. Absolutely the best banana bread I&#039;ve ever made. Kept asking myself, &quot;What the big deal, it&quot;s so simple!&quot; So good.","Delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (used a little less sugar).  Also used two loaf pans rather than one (one plain loaf for bf, and 2nd loaf with nuts and chocolate chips for me) - baked for 50 minutes.  Turned out perfect - will be making this again.  Thanks for posting lkadlec!","Nice moist banana bread. Substituted all purpose gluten free flour. Couldn&#039;t tell the difference. :) Thank you! Will make again!","I don&#039;t ever need another banana bread recipe again. Just perfect! Thanks for sharing.","For a healthier option, I substituted Extra Virgin Olive Oil for butter; and Coconut Brown Sugar for sugar - both at the same measurements as in the recipe. Also added chocolate nibs within the mix, and chocolate shavings all across the top before baking. Excellent!","Great recipe! I&#039;ve use this a couple of times already. I just add 3\/4C sugar instead of 1C to lessen the sweetness. Add cashews or walnuts for crunch","Best banana bread ive tried.  moist, sweet enough, perfect.","Hands down best banana bread recipe! i have made this recipe about a dozen times for home and to give away to family...everyone loves it. You can add chocolate chips or raisins...just delicious! thank you for posting.","From now on, THIS is my banana bread recipe! WOW!!!&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;I followed the recipe and added crushed walnuts at the end... It turned out great!&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;Thank you!!","Just made it!! Super easy and really good","This was fantastic and Easy!!! Tastes awesome!","This is a great recipe. I added 1\/4 cup sour cream just to ease my phobia of dry baked goods, as well as 1\/2 tsp baking powder for a little lift in case the sour cream weighed it down. It&#039;s turned out perfect. Moist and chock full of banana.","I made this banana bread once and loved it. Today I used 4 bananas like the recipe calls for and I think it was to much banana. My bread came out to wet :( does anyone know how many cups of banana it calls for so next time I dont add to much banana. Thank you!!","I love this bread.  My son and my husband loved it too!!! Great recipe","This is really good.  I made a single serving so I cut recipe to.25.  It got really dark after 30 minutes and I did toothpick test.  It came out clean.  Also I  didn&#039;t crush my banana before I added to butter\/sugar mixture so I ended up with pieces of banana in the bread.  I think I like it that way.  Also over ripe bananas make a huge difference.  I just tasted while it was hot and it was delish. I was using the Gold Medal Banana Bread but this my new fav. Walnuts would take this over the top","Best recipe I have ever tried for banana bread. Nice and moist, great banana flavour. Stick to the recipe and this classic couldn&#039;t be better!","This is a great recipe. I would bring down the cook time from 60 minutes to 40. Raisins and chocolate chips spiced it up at bit. With a fine coat of powdered sugar on top, this was awesome!","I rated this 3 stars for the baking instructions . It does not say how many loaf pans nor the size of the pans.&lt;br\/&gt;Do Not Bake this for 60 minutes. If you use dark colored loaf pans reduce heat to 325 degrees. Keep a close eye I recommend starting @30 minutes baking time and go from there.&lt;br\/&gt;This recipe was moist. Folding in your flour will keep the bread tender once baked. The family liked it.","I used a little less sugar, 1\/3 whole wheat flour, and baked in mini loaf pans. Fabulous.","Made just as directed, and it was amazing.  Definitely will be my go-to banana bread now!","This is fantastic and one of the most straightforward banana bread recipes I&#039;ve come across. A keeper. (I added pecans to the batter and sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top).","A great recipe for sure i love it.","Love it.... Moist and delicious! My new goto Banana bread recipe!  :D","This was good but I think a little too sweet. Next time I will try 3\/4 cup of sugar.","This recipe is AWESOME!! I was just searching around for a good recipe on Google and this one came up?and I am so happy that it did! Every single time I&#039;ve made this banana bread, it comes out perfect and is gone ridiculously fast! It makes non-banana fans fall in love with it.","My first time every making Banana Bread for myself, I&#039;ve only had it when other made it, and omg, this is sooooooo good!!!! Thank you!","I always laugh when I see a review for a recipe that says something to the effect of &quot;Best recipe ever!  I replaced this with that, and that with this, and added that and reduced this, and it was the best banana bread I ever made!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!&quot;  I changed nothing, and it truly was the best banana bread I&#039;ve ever made :-).  Not sure if my altitude caused it to rise a ton, but it almost overflowed so I scooped some out and put it in muffin tins, and both the loaf and muffins were perfect.  To be safe, next time I divided the batter into 2 loaf pans and made slightly smaller loaves than I normally would, but that&#039;s certainly no problem.  I highly recommend this recipe (as is, or do what you want with it because you can&#039;t go wrong!).","This has been the best banana bread I ever had... i changed a little for my two year old thoug . 1\/2 of oat instead of the 1\/2 a cup of flour","A simple, delicious recipe for Banana Bread. This bread turned out very moist and full of great banana flavor. Thank You! :)","This banana bread recipe is the BEST.  I would highly recommend using this for muffins especially.  Also, I use less than 3\/4 cup of sugar and 5 bananas, and it&#039;s still super sweet.  So feel free to use less sugar!  &lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;Thanks for sharing!  This is a keeper!","I must admit I really had my fingers crossed hoping this would be as good as everyone said - it is!  The crust on the bread is amazing, and the bread itself is really moist.  We first ate it hot out of the oven by itself, and then warm with BB Homemade Vanilla ice cream. The next morning, I toasted a slice.  It is really good either way.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you so much for sharing.","I&#039;ve tried this simple recipe and the result was amazing. It wasn&#039;t dry like other recipes. I added frozen white chocolate chip and sprinkled it with nuts on top. I didn&#039;t have the loaf pan but i used the muffin tray and the round shaped tray for left overs. Thanks for sharing.","I did tweak  it a little by adding walnuts, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the dry ingredients plus I use 1\/2 cup  each of white and brown sugar!  The Bread came out of the oven and into my honey&#039;s mouth without any complaint and he doesn&#039;t even like bananas!!  Bread is moist, and not extremely dense! Next batch I may add fresh strawberry to it!  Cheers!","This was very easy to make and came out nicely, but it&#039;s way too sweet! Next time I will try cutting the sugar back to 3\/4 cup or less.","Easy and deliciou, I add semi sweet chocolate chips to mine, yummy!","Most excellent! This was gone within 10 minutes!!!","I made this banana bread for my family. We all loved it. This will be the only recipe I will ever use again.","&quot;Best Banana Bread&quot; 04.27.14 Delish! Note: Used 4 small super-ripe bananas. Put tsp fresh lemon juice into banana mash. Added 1 spoonful &quot;cinnamon plus&quot; (pampered chef) to sugar butter mixture. Amazing &amp; keeps well in fridge.","Moist banana bread. Best I&#039;ve made! My family had it eaten in 2 days! Added chocolate chips. Next time I&#039;m adding nuts.","I&#039;ve been looking for a good banana bread recipe for months now and I finally found it! This recipe is so easy to follow and make. Not to mention that they come out incredible. I added chopped pecans to my recipe and made banana muffins instead of a loaf. The muffins cooked in 18-20 minutes at 350","The best banana bread I have ever made\/had. It was so moist and soooo easy to make. Everyone loved it. Especially my 2 year old.","This is the best recipe for banana bread I have ever used and I have been baking for over 60 years.  I added the roughly mashed bananas to the butter and sugar mixture and continued to cream everything together with my mixer.  So simple done this way. I made two small loaves and decreased the baking time.","Simple banana bread recipe,but excellent taste,very moist and great smell. Super delicious!","Forgot to mention Mine rose up and then fell after it cooled..","Old school recipe. Moist, sweet and delicious. I tripled the recipe and it came out perfect. Definitely will be my go to recipe.","Not sure what went wrong.  Followed the recipe exactly and it would not cook in the middle and edges burned!  May be I will try the muffins instead.","Awesome recipe. I had to add some golden raisins and chopped walnuts though to make it that much better.","Worst banana bread I have ever made. Seriously. I recently moved and left my go to banana bread behind. Thought I&#039;d try this recipe since it got good reviews. Followed to a t and is the most disgusting banana bread ever. It didn&#039;t rise it was doughy and all together gross. So disappointed I wasted my bananas on this recipe","The best! I followed the recipe almost to the letter-- just swapped 1\/2 cup of sugar for brown sugar. The result was fabulous. It&#039;s really simple to follow, and I didn&#039;t even use a mixer. Excellent!","Smelled and looked wonderful.  Took out after 1 hr.  Center caved in and middle was still uncooked.... Put it back in.  Hopefully it will be ok","try Martha Stewarts, she has sour cream in hers really delisf I also add nuts and chocolate chips","After I submitted that review I forgot that I did change one thing! I cut back on the amount of sugar to only 1\/2 cup instead of one cup because I prefer it not so sweet. The loaves I made for the church fellowship, however, did have the full cup and as I stated, everyone loved the recipe!","Moist banana bread.  We use it at the end of a meal like dessert!  The best banana bread I have ever made!!  I highly recommend this recipe.","I have tried a few Banana Bread recipes that claim to be the best, but this one stands up to it motto, I have to admit that it is the best Banana Bread recipe ever, easy to follow and clean up is a breeze as well. I am truly a believer as proven by the amount of stars that i gave it.","Easy to make, moist and flavourful.","Really good and very easy. I made as muffins (made 16) and baked for 30 minutes!!","First time making this and everyone agrees it&#039;s a keeper - totally 5 stars!","Just made this and it was a hit! Loved it.","Perfect banana bread recipe.  So moist and not too sweet.  Everyone in my family agreed this was the best banana bread I have ever made.  I probably will never try another banana bread recipe again.","Yummy and Simple!  What else can you ask for?  The only thing I did different was add some chopped walnuts.  Thank you so much for sharing.","I am pretty new to the baking world, as I have always viewed recipes as &quot;jumping off points to spark my creativity.&quot; This banana bread recipe was absolutely perfect! And it was simple and clear enough to keep me disciplined not to embellish (yet). ;-) My family loved it, too!","I have made this twice, once as written and once with a few ground walnuts. A good and moist banana bread but not the best I&#039;ve ever had.","Fantastic! Followed recipe exactly. Tastes much better than every box mix I&#039;ve tried, and the ingredients are all common stuff I had in my kitchen already. Fluffy and delicious. &lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;As a garnish, I melted a bit of butter (2 tbsp or so) and poured it over the top of the loaf along with a dusting of powdered sugar. Totally optional, that&#039;s just a thing I like to add to all my homemade banana breads to make the crust that much more delicious.","OH MY SWEET TASTEBUDS!!! I have made literally dozens of banana bread loaves over the years, using dozens of recipes. This is without a doubt the most wonderful, delicious recipe for banana bread I have ever tried! I did add some cinnamon and chopped pecans, and it ended up baking for 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for before it was fully cooked in the middle. But I kid you not, this recipe is so good it will make you weak in the knees! Ohhhh yummmmm!!","This is sooo good! I do add cinnamon, nutmeg, walnuts, and golden raisins. Sometimes I use applesauce (instead of butter) and it still tastes great.","Bananas come in all shapes and sizes.  How many cups of bananas should I use?  I made this using the same amount of bananas (1 1\/3 cups) as other breads that call for 1.5 cups flour.  It came out fine but I wish I knew what the contributor&#039;s 4 bananas yielded then I&#039;d feel more confident in rating it.","Love it...added finely chopped walnuts...loved it even more.  Thank you!","Quick and easy!!!! So moist and delicious!!!","Hands down the best! I have always added walnuts, that would be my only suggestion.","This is one of the better recipes I&#039;ve gotten from food.com. I had some gnarly looking neglected bananas and limited resources so I chose this recipe simply because it required so few ingredients. I didn&#039;t even have white sugar in hand, so I substituted brown sugar I had leftover from a previous engagement with cookies (I used a recipe from this website actually and they were disgusting). Good news is this recipe turned out great! I added 1\/3 cup of coconut oil because it adds a great flavor, aroma, and moisture to the bread! Everything else is to the book and I will be making this again, since on the go breakfast food never lasts long in my house with mine and my boyfriends early morning, busy schedules.","Easy to make and delicious.  I added walnuts because I like them.  My son ate 3\/4 of the loaf within 2 hours.  I had to stop him because I wanted somemore.","oops, forgot to add the stars.  It&#039;s the best.","i added coconut\/ground and walnuts to mine. Using a bundt pan as i feel there is too much for 1 loaf pan and not enough for 2. whenever i make ANY banana bread i never mix and bake as you need to let batter sit so banana flavor is full bodied. I also put bananas in oven,with skins on, for 20 min before using and that strengthens flavor as well.","Great banana bread!   Reduced sugar by 25% and will probably reduce more next time.  Pleasantly sweet but trying to reduce sugar across the board.  Increased bananas to about double small ones and added a 1\/2 tsp baking powder.   Would probably reduce the heat 25 degrees next time as well.  Baked just a little brown and dry on the bottom, but really a good recipe overall.  Moist, sweet and yummy!","Like everyone said,","This is by far one of the best I have come a crossed!! (Even better then my mother in laws!) simply, moist and great flavor!! My five year old had a blast mashing everything together!","Well done. I made this recipe and people loved it! My wife tried her family recipe to trump this, and we wound up back at this one after the taste tests. It&#039;s a keeper!","Absolutely delicious.  I did have to bake 20 min longer. But perfect outcome. Yummmmm","This banana bread was delicious. I made it the night before Thanksgiving and served it on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I did however melt the butter and add walnuts. I have already bought more bananas and am eagerly awaiting for the right time to make the bread again, as I only got one slice to myself :)","Cook time for this is more than 1 hour after one hour the center was still not done and very runny.but the bottom was very done almost burnt. I think this is a flop recipe. Will never Tru it again","Great flavor. I was starting to get concerned about the color after 25 minutes remained. It looked like it was completely done and I was concerned I&#039;d either dry it out or burn it. The final result was a little dryer and darker than I prefer. I would definitely monitor cooking at the 30-40 minute mark. The 60 minute cooking time may not be necessary.","Good recipe, I added mini Cho Chips and chopped pecans, yum!!! I&#039;ve made also with chopped dried cherries and pecans and that&#039;s a nice bread for toasting with creme cheese on top.","Great recipe. Added choc chips. Can be make in large 6 muffin tin. 1 ice cream scoop per muffin. cook for 30 mins. I only had a 6 muffin tin. The rest I put in a small loaf tin and cooked as per recipe. Both came out great and did not last long! Thanks for sharing.","my search is over, toss in some walnuts or chocolate chips or maybe top with a lemon zest glaze, perfect","Excellent bread! I added chopped walnut and threw everything in the bread machine. It cooked on a quick bread cycle which was about 90 minutes. I do half white sugar half light brown sugar and it&#039;s really good. I have made this with three large bananas and it has turned out perfect too.","Gluten Free\/Dairy Free version :  Tried and tested and it is Fabulous using this recipe as my template.  Very moist and delicious- I actually said &quot;WOW&quot;  out loud when I took my first bite.  I mix a 40\/60 ratio of Sorghum\/Millet &amp; Potato\/Arrowroot. I used refined Coconut oil in lieu of butter and added a tsp of xantham &amp; 1 c.  of walnuts  (that a lot of walnuts, but we like em). Also used 1\/2 c. cane sugar &amp; 1\/2 cup brown sugar.  Everything else is the same.  Cook maybe 65 minutes according to instructions and allow to cool completely before slicing. (No need to flour the pan, it releases just fine w\/ spray only).  Simply Delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!","This is delicious! There is one thing I always do when baking any type of dessert bread is to dip a knife into vegetable oil &amp; cut a slit down the center of the loaf before baking. I finally found a GREAT recipe for banana bread!","I trying to cut back on added sugar, so the only change I made was to use 1\/2 cup splenda and 1\/2 cup splenda brown sugar blend.  Wonderful recipe - just what I was looking for.  All I wanted was a good old fashioned banana bread, no sour cream or other ingredients.  This smells wonderful and tastes even better.  My go to recipe for banana bread from now on.","Wow, this is the BEST banana bread recipe I&#039;ve found! I used 5 small bananas that I&#039;d kept in the fridge - they had turned completely dark brown so I wasn&#039;t sure, but they were sweet and good. I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and added 1\/2 tsp cinnamon. I used half butter, half applesauce and I took one reviewer&#039;s idea and crumbled brown sugar over the top. My family (including ME) can&#039;t stay away from it! The flavors are intense and wonderful. I baked it exactly 60 mins. Thank you for a fantastic recipe!","Best banana bread!! I added 1\/2 tsp cinnamon and 1\/4 nutmeg. I also only used 3 large bananas and added 1\/2 cup walnuts so delicious!!!","Good base recipe used half the sugar and half the butter added some oil. added raisins, dried cranberries, blueberries, sesame seeds and sunflower seeds","Very good recipe! Bread came out great! I made a few adjustments though: I used 1 cup of wheat flour and 1\/2 cup of white flour.  I also used 1\/3 cup of maple syrup instead of sugar and 3 bananas instead of four ( I find it less sweet this way) I also added 1\/4 tsp of baking powder because of the wheat flour. It was still very moist with the adjustments, but didn&#039;t rise as high as an all white flour recipe would have. I also took it our a little sooner than an hour.  All in all, my little ones and I love it!","Delicious! I didn&#039;t have 4 bananas, only 3, So I added about 1\/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce. I also included walnuts.","I didn&#039;t have regular cane sugar so I used brown sugar and added an extra banana (5 medium sized) and hoped for the best. It turned out fantastic. I also cooked it in a bundt pan instead of a loaf pan for 49 minutes and it fell straight out of the pan beautifully onto the cake stand. Will be making this again.","As of my writing, there are 593 reviews.  There is a reason for that!  This is a fantastic and simple recipe with excellent results.  I only had 3 banana&#039;s so i pulled back 1\/2 cup on the flour.  So, so good!!","My daughter told me to save this recipe....this was the best one so far!!","Great receipt, very moist and delicious!","I Loved it and so did my family. my only modification was to add a teaspoon of cinnamon. Yummy!!!!","I am not a great baker by any means, but I just made this and it came out great. I substituted 1 cup of brown sugar because I ran out of white sugar 2 cups in, and it still tasted great.","This was my first time making banana bread and it was a success! I didn&#039;t have any vanilla so I just skipped it. This came out moist and delicious, this recipe is definitely a keeper!","Best Banana bread I&#039;ve had, Nice and moist. The only change I made was I used 1\/2 C brown sugar and 1\/2 C white.","This bread is delicious and easy! I didn&#039;t deviate from the recipe except to add walnuts and it came out great!","I tried this recipe because it requires less ingredients than my go-to Banana Bread recipe. It didn&#039;t bake as well and I didn&#039;t get a moist, flavorful bread.","I have been using this recipe for more than 20 years. I had gotten it originally from a local church cookbook. My family and I love this so much much that I never searched for any other banana bread recipes. Adding pecans or walnuts is a must.","Best banana bread recipe.  Even my picky 6 year old loved it!","Best recipe for banana bread I have found! My search is over. The only thing I changed was adding chopped pecans.","Really, really good.  Its a top shelf recipe.  If I were to add any changes or comments I would note that it can tolerate 65 minutes in the oven, and if your bananas are large, go with 3 1\/2.","Hands down just as stated in the Title.","I&#039;m very disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the instructions perfectly yet when putting it in the oven and baked for 180 deg, after only 50min I noticed it had already started to burn.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;For anyone else looking at this recipe, I would recommend about 40-45 min in the oven only.  I&#039;m sure its a great recipe but due to the poor instructions, it was a burnt banana bread for me.","Easy and delicious!","Amazing banana flavor. Had to cook much longer than 60 minutes. All in all 3 stars as it was just ok.","Love it! I substituted the butter for unsweetened apple sauce and added 1 tsp of baking powder. Makes for an amazing lower calorie banana bread. My husband loved it too!","Turned out really good! Very simple, one-bowl recipe; easy to make, easy to clean up. Followed recipe exactly, except I used 1 teaspoon vanilla instead of 1\/2. This will b! my go-to recipe from now on!","I made this bread for my parents, myself and my sister. I added a dollop of sour cream and used 3 bananas instead of four. The bread was moist and delicious. Everybody loved it. My dad wants me to make another loaf for him with raisins, so I am going to try that this weekend for his birthday.","I made these as muffins using a muffins tin, NOT cupcake. Cook same temperature. Bake for only 25-30 min... I had amazing results. The best I&#039;ve ever had. Compareable to grams","Simply the best banana bread ever. Just made it and it is deliscious. Nice and moist on the inside, crispy crust on the outside!","I am making this again because here in the Boston area we are getting another blizzard and you have to have awesome snacks when it is stormy! The last time I made it, I ate half of it myself! It&#039;s soooo good! Thanks for the recipe.","My banana bread turned out perfectly and was delicious! I substituted Bob&#039;s Red Mill gluten free baking flour and light brown sugar and added a little more vanilla. I am sticking with this recipe from.now on. Oh, and my bread took only 45 minutes, maybe because I used a dark metal pan.","This is definitely a keeper. I replaced 1\/4 of the flour with flax meal and added pecans and it was moist and delicious but, I&#039;m sure it is equally good exactly as written. Mine was perfectly done after an hour. For the reviewer that said their&#039;s was done at 45 minutes: did you use a pan larger than the recommended 8X4?","Very TAsty, I add 1 tsp of nutmeg, it realy compliments the cinnamon, and gives the bread an extra kick!","So easy to make.  My 12 year old kept going into the kitchen asking if it were done yet.  Ha ha ha!  As soon as I put it on the counter, he was begging for a piece.  This was delicious.  We will be making this again, and again, and again.","This is the best banana bread recipe I&#039;ve ever tried and I&#039;ve done quite a few. I did make a few changes from my previous experience. \nI used 1\/2 cup of brown sugar and 1\/2 cup of granulated sugar instead of only using granulated. \nI added 1 tsp of cinnamon. \nI added chocolate chips because there were some in my cupboard I didn&#039;t know what to do with. \nI added a cinnamon\/brown sugar crumble topping.\nAlso b\/c i had just the right amount of butter and didn&#039;t want to start a new stick, I used coconut oil to grease the pan.","This was an amazing recipe. I poured a half of the batter into the pan. I then added a layer of brown sugar and cinnamon mixture and topped the remaining batter over the layer of brown sugar and cinnamon. I used a knife and marbled the batter to create a cinnamon swirl.","A must try recipe, easy, quick ,and delicious !  Brought it to work with me , everyone loved it ! Easy to make, EASY TO EAT, YUM YUM !!          Bobbie Butcher Gillette,Wyoming","This is a great recipe!  My kids are 4.5 and 2.5 and they are the pickiest of eaters but they love this.  The only tweak I made was to add cinnamon.  I don&#039;t measure it out... I just keep adding a little until I can smell bananas and cinnamon in the batter.  My kids and I can go through a whole loaf in day if I don&#039;t stop us :)","Love it ! Just tried it today was super easy to prepare and tastes great ! this is the first banana bread recipe I try and will be my only one. My husband loved it too!","Made this tonight. Put together quickly, and I added about 1\/2 cup coarsely  chopped walnuts. Excellent. Will definitely be making again!","I have tried several recipes for banana bread. This is by far the best one. My family could not get enough","I have to agree, it is the BEST banana bread I have ever made and I&#039;ve been cooking and baking for over 40 years.  I have made banana breads with alot more ingredients, more complicated recipes, but this is simple and delicious.  You really taste bananas.  It&#039;s now the only recipe I will ever use.  So glad I found it!","I have made a lot of banana bread and have used numerous recipes. This is by far my favorite!! Would recommend to all.","This is a very good banana bread recipe.  It doesn&#039;t require too many ingredients, and the preparation time needed is short.  I followed the directions exactly as stated, and it turned out great.  It was flavorful, moist, and easy to make.  And it leaves a fabulous aroma in the house!","This is great banana bread its easy and tastes great, one word of advice do not add in more banana&#039;s than the recipe calls for I added 5 bananas and it made for a great tasting but mushy on the inside bread. This is my new go to recipe!","NEVER waste your &#039;nanners on another recipe again.  This has been my go-to banana bread recipe for years. Hands down, the BEST.   It&#039;s fun to use chocolate chips too...but not TOO many &#039;cuz then you end up with a bit of a mess.  AND if anyone out there has experimented with incorporating peanut butter into this recipe, let me know...I&#039;d love to know measurements, etc  :)","This is a very simple, great tasting recipe. I add a little bit of cinnamon to mine, though I am sure it doesn&#039;t need it, I just like it :)\nGreat recipe!!!","Threw out the old butter stained 3 by 5 note card I&#039;ve used for years.  This one is perfect.","Best recipe ever;\nSimple but scrumptious!","A good basic banana bread recipe. I made it healthier by using half the butter and replacing the other half with applesauce. I used half the sugar (the applesauce replaces the sweetness) and added bran to the flour. Some cinnamon sprinkled in was a great compliment. Also some coconut on top really adds a nice flavor\/texture as well :)","This Recipe is delicious! Very moist &amp; I used white &amp; wheat flour. I also added walnuts. I was asked to share the recipe more than once, by request...that says it is awesome. Thank you for sharing this. It&#039;s a keeper!","I would love to rate this recipe as high as the others and I&#039;ve tried it twice.  It takes much, much, much, much, much, much (you get the point!) longer than 60 minutes to cook.  The middle never seems to cook beyond batter.  I&#039;m using a loaf pan as directed, but not having any luck with getting the middle to turn into a bread, instead of a liquid.  I&#039;ll look for a different recipe.","Really good recipe!! I replaced half the butter with cream cheese and the texture came out great.","This bread is so great! I&#039;ve made is tons of times, and it only ever lasts a day or two in my apartment before my boyfriend eats it all. I add blueberries to the batter and make muffins instead of bread. It&#039;s the perfect grab-and-go breakfast!","This is a good basic recipe for banana bread. I like to add rough chopped salted mixed nuts with raisins or chocolate chips. My husband likes raisins and I like the chocolate chips. Or just plain it is really good toasted and buttered.","Moist and well-defined banana flavor, but bland.  Only good if you haven&#039;t had good banana bread before.","This is by far my favorite recipe. Not just for banana bread, but in general. I love baking and this is my go-to. EVERYONE raves about it and it is so easy it&#039;s unbelievable. I like to put a layer of brown sugar on top before baking.. it gives it the PERFECT crust.. not too sweet but an amazing texture.","Fabulous! Followed this recipe with one little tweak...I used 3\/4 cup sugar and 1\/4 cup brown sugar. Moist and full of flavor...delightful!","Wonderful banana bread recipe. I used 1\/2 a cup of sugar and 1\/2 a cup of Splenda with excellent results. Next time I will try all Splenda in place of the sugar. Also, I addes 1\/2 tsp. cinnamon to the recipe.","Delicious! I only had three bananas so I added about a third cup of Greek yogurt and crossed my fingers hoping it would help keep the bread tasty and moist. Turned out great and I actually may prefer it with this modification too!","My 2 year old son loves to cook,BBQ,and now bake with me. It was simple enough that I was able to focus on him and having fun but had just the rite amount of everything to make a perfect loaf of our favorite bread. ideal balance of moisture,flavor,and density!","I&#039;ve only tasted the dough so far, but I&#039;m impressed! My banana bread dough doesn&#039;t usually taste this good. :)\nI added cinnamon, too.","Basic Recipe is pretty good.  Some ways I altered it for the better:  Add walnuts and raisins.  Substitute 1\/3 of floor for 1\/3 of quick rolled oats.  Bake in 3 pans instead ot 2.\nWhen looves come out of oven, make a series of even stabs with a fork over the entire surface of the lof top.  Smear slightly melted frozen orange juice concentrait (don&#039;t dilute it) over the surface.  The heat will cause the frozen orange juice to melt and go down the little punctures you have made.  This will be the glaze on the top, and add nice moisture and rich flavor.","my banana bread came out very spongy, soft and sweet! I blended all wet ingredients in my trusty blender. I slowly mixed in flour and lastly, mixed in the vanilla. Let settle for one minute and baked it for an hr. I served mine with vanilla bean ice cream! It was a hiiiiiit! Thanks.","Easy and nice for a rather healthy snack. I used brown sugar and a cup full seemed to make it too sweet. I&#039;d use 1\/2 cup next time and see what happens. Maybe even less than that. Otherwise- great recipe, thanks! :)","I just wanted a quick and easy banana recipe and this one was perfect! I threw it together in no time and it turned out delicious. I added largely chopped pecans. Will be a favorite from now on. Thanks for posting.","I wouldn&#039;t consider it the best recipe. The cook temp was a bit high, and it turned out a little dark for my tastes. The consistency in the center was fine, but the flavor was off. The best recipe is something that can be demolished before anyone else even had a chance.  : D  I&#039;m fine after one piece thanks...","A very simple recipe but the result is delicious! Love it!","I have made this bread twice-once with chocolate chips and once without and both times turned out amazing! Honestly one of the best recipes out there. So simple to make and it taste delicious. Huge hit with my boyfriend.","I also add granola &amp; it tastes delicious as well. :)","The recipe is so simple and it comes out PERFECT every time! I love it.","My mom asked me for my recipe","Great recipe. I made a lot of changes though and thought I should share. So, I only had 2 bananas so I googled banana replacements and found that Greek yogurt is a great substitute. I used 1\/4 of a cup of the yogurt. I also replaced the butter with home made apple sauce with a little cinnamon in it.  I used brown sugar and half white flour and wheat flower. I also added dark chocolate chips and chopped roasted almonds. It was delicious!! I am ready to make it again!","Absolutely THE BEST banana bread recipe I&#039;ve ever tried! Very moist and a lovely light texture, so good. I added walnut pieces...mmmmm","i love this recipe! only one thing i change is cut off the 1\/2 cup of sugar","Very moist and delicious banana bread. I just used 1\/4 cup less sugar and very ripe bananas and it was perfectly sweet.","Delicious!  Best recipe ever.  :)","Made this Gluten Free for my girlfriend who is celiac. I simply substituted 1 cup of Brown Rice Flour and 1\/2 cup Corn Starch which I sifted together, for the 1 1\/2 cups of All-Purpose Flour.  Turned out awesome, one of the best gluten-free breads I&#039;ve ever had.  Like others, I think I would fold in a 1\/2 cup or so of Walnuts next time. It was very moist, and the top and edges had a great crunchy sweet taste. Also very good Banana flavor and very moist.","Great at recipe! Very moist I just added cinnamon n made muffins turned out terrific.  Will try next time with pecans or walnuts.","Absolutely delicious! Very moist! And very easy to make too! Added walnuts to recipe and straight down the middle on the top. Recommend everyone have this recipe in their collection.","Excellent, very moist. I have been using another recipe that was a little more work to do and my kids loved it, couldn&#039;t keep it around for more than a day.....and I would double the recipe. I decided to look for a more simple recipe and made this one. Kids love it even more, didn&#039;t know that could happen, lol. I did add a 1\/4 of a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and I only had it in oven for 50 min. so I would start checking it at 45 mins. Great recipe, thx. IT&#039;S A KEEPER!! Oh, I also like mine with pecans or walnuts but didn&#039;t have any, will try that next time.","Best banana bred recipe. My kids loved it.","Very authentic very delicious","LOVE LOVE LOVE this very easy recipe.  I&#039;ve messed it up a couple of times, and it still turns out great.  This last time, I used melted instead of softened butter and threw everything into one bowl.  Just stirred it up.  It was yummy!  I like to add applesauce to give it even more moist-ness.  Wonderful recipe!","My fiance&#039;s mother is hard to impress with cooking, and she literally said that my banana bread was better than hers and every single person who tried it, LOVED IT! I had to make 3 loafs and they were gone quick!","My new favorite banana bread recipe! The only thing this needs is one and one-half cup of pecan or walnut halves.","This recipe pass if you like a traditional moist sweet banana bread. This recipe is bland.  It was bland and yucky.  I don&#039;t write recipe reviews but it was a waste of time and ingredients.  I did not leave any ingrediants out nor did I skip a step. I through it out . Batter tasted good but after it baked it was blah!!!","Followed the recipe and added 3\/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1C of semi sweet chocolate chips.  Sooooo yummy. You will love it.  Great with Vanilla Ice Cream if you want to use for dessert.","im 15 and I made this at home and it turned out amazing!!","There&#039;s already so many good reviews but I wanted to write one anyways because this recipe is sooo yummy! Made it last night and it tastes even better today. Instead of making a loaf I put the batter into a muffin tray and baked for 25 minutes but I suggest 30. I added chopped walnuts, sliced almonds, chocolate chunks and a bit of walden farms 0 calorie pancake syrup. I also substituted the flour for oatmeal that I blended up! I highly suggest this recipe! I&#039;m going to make it again and try stevia and quest protein powder instead of flour :)!","I&#039;ve lost count how many different banana bread recipes I&#039;ve made. Finally, I have found The One. Taste, texture, just right. I did stir in 1\/2 cup chopped pecans at the end.Keep refrigerated.  It is the best!","Great recipe, I recommend adding some cinnamon, replace sugar with 3\/4 cups sugar and 1\/4 cup brown sugar, add walnuts and about 1\/4 cup of cream cheese to batter to make a creamier tastier bread.","Delicious! Made this on a Sunday winter morning, warmed me up and filled the house with lovely smells. Yummy and super easy!","This one is a keeper!! Taste just like my grandma use to make it..And what makes it even better is that it&#039;s SO EASY to put together!! So, 5 stars to the chef :-)","Maybe a little less butter and sugar. Very good. Would recommend to anyone. Chocolate chips are good.","I made this recipe in huge batches when someone gifted me a crate of super ripe bananas. I accidentally adjusted it because I ran out of or didn&#039;t have certain ingredients. I used 3\/4c sugar...much better, less sweet; I also used baking powder instead of baking soda because I didn&#039;t have any. I also used unsalted butter. All of these were based on lack of ingredients, but the substitutions made it terrific! Works terrific even if you double or triple it.","I mashed the bananas with a potato masher, so there were tiny chunks of banana, which is excellent. Also reduced the sugar a little, and added 2 tbsp molasses and 1\/3+ cup of raisins. The bread is heavy, moist and DELICIOUS. The prep for this is simple--I&#039;ll certainly be making this again!","I have made this twice, this is the best banana bread recipe and I&#039;ve made different ones. The first time with chocolate morsels and second time with walnuts and morsels together...it was awesome both times....must have recipe!!! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe .... my family keep bugging me to make it!","This is the recipe in my Johnson Family cookbook.. And everyone loves it!!

Amazing recipe! So so simple and delicious! Thank you!","I am not a baker- far, far from it. I used this recipe to see if it was in fact no fail even for me. I mistook the kruzteaz pancake mix bag for flour... Needless to say I went with it, and threw in a handful of chopped walnuts. It truly is a no fail. It was the best tasting bread I ever made. My ever critical mother gave me rave reviews AND asked for the recipe!","Stunning recipe! Added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of lemon juice, as well as a pinch of nutmeg. Also used half the flour and added almond flour for the other half. I find using almond flour makes cakes and breads so much more moist! My bread came out beautifully ??? so pleased","I signed up for Food.com just to write this review...I have made banana bread from a bunch of different recipes and cookbooks over the years...this is the best one I&#039;ve tried. It&#039;s just simple and delicious. It was delicious right out of the oven, but even better after it sat for a while in the fridge. Print it and keep it!!","This is the best I have had in a long time. You will not be disappointed!","I didn&#039;t believe this would turn out with just 1.5 cups of flour, but it did and it was excellent!!! I followed the recipe exact. I think you could cut down the sugar to 3\/4 cup and not even notice. I added walnuts just because I like nuts in my breads. This is my new favorite banana bread recipe.","Best Ever!!! I subbed 1\/4 c. Coconut oil &amp; 1\/4 c. Applesauce for the 1\/2 c. Butter. Subbed whole wheat flour. Added about 1\/2 tsp. cinnamon and about 1\/2 c. Walnut pieces. Topped with 1\/4 c. Chopped walnuts, course brown sugar and a light dusting of cinnamon. It looks beautiful and tastes just as good as it looks! Super moist!!","I went through 3-4 banana bread recipes and wasn&#039;t satisfied until I made this one. Very moist, delicious, and as soon as it hits my palette I&#039;m like &quot;mmmmm, there you are!&quot; This is the one I&#039;ve been searching for. I definitely recommend it.","This is absolutely the best recipe for banana bread Ive ever tasted and I do alot of baking.I followed the recipe exactly as written,even the bake time was perfect.I think the key is using over ripe bananas.I made it again using one cup chopped walnuts-excellent.I made it a third time using one cup mini chocolate chips and increased baking time by 5 minutes.Thanks for the recipe!","Awesome.","I've made this several times with different additions. Sliced almonds, dried cranberries, even chopped strawberries. The banana flavor tastes great with almost anything. Always a hit.","I saw that I had some very ripe bananas, but no oil, so I searched for a recipe without using oil and came across this one. I will never use another banana bread recipe again. This is AMAZING! So moist and delicious. I love that it uses more bananas than a traditional recipe because you can really taste the banana flavor beautifully. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!","Thank you for the recipe\nI would like to replace the butter with oil - how much to use?","Delicious!!!!!!!!! I&#039;ve tried other banana bread recipes that weren&#039;t great but this recipe is awesome.","This recipie is yummy!! I always add brown sugar on the top before I cook it, tastes so good","Terrible!  I cooked it foe an extra 20 min and it was still doughy.  It&#039;s going right in the garbage.","I love this recipe!!! It is so easy that I remembered it after doing it only one time. I made mine dairy free though by substituting the butter for coconut oil and I absolutely love the texture that it gives it plus its much healthier for you! Everyone who has tried it has asked me to make them a loaf!","I have never written a review, however this was a MUST!!! This banana bread was so moist and delicious.  I had to use baking powder instead of soda so I added a half cup of sugar to compensate for the possible bitter from the powder.  I doubled the batch but only used 5 very ripe bananas.  This bread was perfect, buttery, moist and delicious.  Next time I will omit the extra sugar. I love the fact that it has no extra add ins, just banana and bread.  Oh sliced with a slathering of natural peanut butter is really like OMGoooosh!!!","On a scale of one to ten, this is a ten! Add walnuts and you have an eleven. I learned a new trick on accident while making this recipe for a potluck. I forgot to take my overripe bananas out of the freezer in advance. I thawed them a bit in the microwave, but in the interest of time I ended up just pureeing them in the blender. It made the banana bread soooo smooth. It really upped the anty on the deliciousness factor.","This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I&#039;m not a baker but I looooove cooking so I need very straightforward hard to muck up recipes. This one&#039;s perfect! I followed it almost exactly. I had to use turbinado sugar and added raisins at the end. It&#039;s perfectly moist and flavorful. My 4 bananas were pretty ripe and average to large sized. Next time I&#039;ll try adding blueberries. Enjoy!","Very easy. I doubled the recipe and added chocolate chips to half and chopped walnuts to the rest. I made 8 mini loaves out of the doubled recipe and baked them for 40 minutes.","This recipe is my go to. It&#039;s simply AMAZING! The only tweaking I&#039;ve done is adding less sugar (1\/2 cup ripe bananas are sweet enough) and add more spices.","Best banana bread Ever!!! I put some choc chips in to made it a lot sweeter!!","Very good, very easy recipe. It took no time to prepare. I literally just rough measured all the ingredients and dumped them all in a bowl without creaming or sifting or mashing and mixed everything till well mixed. Used cinnamon instead of vanilla since I ran out. Super easy! Came out yummy.","Wow this was good.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  I love banana bread but have long struggled to make it just the way I like it.  This recipe was perfect!  Great banana flavor and great texture.","One of the best banana breads I&#039;ve tried but I add craisins to the filling and walnuts to the top","I was feeling sick and wanted something simple and delicious-I was not disappointed when I made this! Tastes great and is easy to cook, I highly recommend it.","Have made this twice in the last month! Absolutely amazing, first time making this I added baking gumdrops and the second time I added some chocolate chips on top, great recipe, my family loves it! Cooking time took a little longer but I used the wrong baking pan, still turned out amazing!","Made this for the first time for a work party. Was a huge hit. Super moist and really delicious.","What did I do wrong? The bread itself is yummy but it took 1hr 20 mins and still a bit too moist. Not the best banana bread recipe ever but still good :)","This is truly the best banana bread. Try adding nutmeg and cinnamon and you won't regret it","I tried this reciep last week and my friend 2yr old couldn&#039;t get enough. I love that it is  so basic and I don&#039;t need to refrigerate, cause there is none left to do so. It&#039;s painful to wait for cooking and cool down.\nThe 3rd time I replaced the butter with creamy peanut butter and decreased the sugar to 3\/4cup, because I used Jiff, and their reaction was &quot;thats all you made?&quot; It was a triple batch.","I made this recipe tonight and I have to say, this bread is really good! I didn&#039;t add anything to it but I did use butter to coat the pan rather grease or oil and the outside of the bread tastes so good!!","i have tried making banana bread 6 times before trying this,(2 of those were mixes and all 6 of them failed),and i made perfect banana bread with this recipe ?","Perfect banana bread! My first time trying this receipt. I consider myself an expert at making banana bread.  I love this recipe because it&#039;s very simple and effective. I made a few adjustments. I used salted butter to reduce the required amount of salt. I also used  half a cup of brown sugar and added less than a 1\/4 cup dried canberries. And of course i added wallnuts.  My bread came out perfect!","This recipe is the best banana recipe I&#039;ve found!","Made as muffins and cooked for 20 minutes. Perfect","Recipe was great. Way better than the commericial ones i buy. I also added sunflower seeds, chopped walnuts and fresh blueberries. It tastes perfect! Unfortunately my bread was a little crumbly but other than that it&#039;s great.","This was an excellent recipe!  Thank you for sharing.  I did it in a muffin form, baked at 360 for 20 minutes or so.  They are so moist!","I modified this recipe for a lower carb, lower sugar version. Sub half the flour with almond flour; use 2\/3 cup of Splenda baking formula in place of sugar; and replaced half the bananas with no sugar added applesauce. Also added 1\/2 tsp cinnamon and 1\/4 tsp ginger.","I love how easy this recipe is.  I added blueberries to mine and bakes it using mini muffin tins for perfect school snacks.","Great recipe! I&#039;ve made this a handful of times (+ 1c. chopped pecans or walnuts) and it&#039;s delicious every single time. This recipe can make 1 large loaf or 2 medium sized ones.","This is an excellent banana bread recipe. The bread comes out moist and holds together nicely. I&#039;ve made it following the recipe exactly and also by substituting half or all of the bananas with mashed pawpaw fruit. It&#039;s also excellent with black or English walnuts in it. If you use a convection oven, reduce the bake time to 45 minutes.","The flavor of this recipe was delicious! I used (really) old bananas from the freezer (like 3 months old), which was fine, but I think I should have split the recipe into two pans because there was a 4inch x 4inch cube of banana soup in the middle of the loaf. I had to eat around it b\/c I couldn&#039;t put it back in the oven without burning the rest of it.\n\nHot tip: Generously sprinkle whole flax seeds on top of the loaf before baking! Gives it a fun crunch!","This really is the best banana bread! Everyone loved it. I made three mini loaves which cooked for about 35 minutes.","As everyone states this is a very tasty banana bread and so easy to make, but I still messed it up a little, and here is how. The reason I made the bread was I had 6 bananas going bad in the refrigerator. They were very large and very soft. I followed the recipe exactly and after 45 mins in the oven the loaf liked like it was browning too much, so I thought it was done. I took it out and tilted it out of the loaf pan onto a wire rack. Well, about 5 tablespoons of liquid poured out of the top of the loaf.\n\nAfter putting it back in the loaf pan and giving it another 15 mins on 350 it was great. The edges or outside pieces were crispy, and as you got more towards the middle it got softer and moist, and was to die for. Cooking is my thing not baking, so this recipe is really great for idiots like me who don&#039;t quite follow he cooking times and still want to recover.\n\nAfter reading other reviews, I will however next time try brown sugar and cut back on the ripeness of the bananas. I also think raisins would go well with this recipe. Enjoy the aroma in your house as you bake this, it&#039;s wonderful.","My first banana bread! Brilliant!\nI used bananas that were getting ugly that I had stuffed in the freezer for just a day like this.\nI added walnuts, duh! \nThe directions kinda made it seem like a smooth dough was essestial. I got it super smooth &amp; WOW.\nWe ate that loaf in two sittings! This will be the only BB recipe in our house. \nAnd, I&#039;m never gonna feed bananas to the chickens again!","Super simple &amp; delicious...bursting with banana flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. This banana bread was a huge hit with my family...especially my husband!","This was darned tasty! Because bananas are so variable in size, my four bananas were probably a bit much, so that after an hour, the top of the loaf still looked too wet. I turned off the oven and left the loaf inside while I worked on other projects, checking periodically until it didn&#039;t shine. Then I covered it with a kitchen towel and let it cool on a rack on the counter, wrapped it in foil and refrigerated overnight.","YES! YES! YES!\nI have never baked banana bread before, but I&#039;ve eaten heaps of them while living in Australia, and this tastes even better than I remember them! \nEasiest recipe ever, too. I only had two bananas, so I divided all measurements in two and added some pumpkin seeds for extra texture, and other than the height of the bread not being as in the pictures everything else was perfect, and the taste was of course YUMMY! \nWill save recipe and definitely make again!","Such a great banana flavour, great crust, amazing!\n\nFor my own spin, I did half brown sugar, half white sugar. Also, I added a cup of walnuts and chocolate chips because... Why not?! My cooking time ended up being closer to 50 minutes, so check at 50 minutes with a toothpick!","Our family has made this banana bread three times now and every time it has been fantastic! So moist and delicious! Thank you for the recipe.","Best banana bread recipe to date! Love it. It&#039;s fluffy and delicious. I added some ceylon cinnamon.","I love this banana bread.......I recommend this to anyone.......I added pecans to mine......DELICIOSO......","Tasty and easy love it","So I used exact quantities and ingredients from the recipe apart from adding a dash of cream and chocolate chips.. but my bread actually rose out of my pan and is dripping down to the bottom of the oven. I picked up what I could while its baking and it tastes delicious hahaha but it keeps rising and crumbling out of the pan. Any solutions?","This bread&#039;s name is fitting.  I made a loaf the other day and took it to work.  Everyone said it was the best they ever had and asked for the recipe.  Now I&#039;m buying bananas just so they can over ripen and I can make some more!  Thanks for this great recipe.","I&#039;d have to say this is the best banana bread recipe I&#039;ve made and I&#039;ve made mamy. The bread is very moist and tastes so good.","Truly the best banana bread recipe ever.  Made it just like it says for a bake sale and had people coming back asking for the banana bread - sold out of it quick!  I could&#039;ve made just the banana bread and not bothered with cookies at the sale!!","Very simple and easy recipe that comes out delicious!   The only  change I made to the recipe is adding 1\/2- 1 teaspoon ginger, 1\/2- 1  teaspoon Chinese five spice and 1\/2-1  teaspoon cinnamon.  More of a banana spice bread but very delicious","Super yummy. I&#039;m terrible cook but this ended up awesome, my bf liked it a lot.","I am just a beginner in baking and I must say I nailed this one.  This is so easy to make and the recipe is very simple even someone who is new in baking like me can easily do.  My family and friends love it.  So moist and yummy!","I plan on making this tomorrow but I&#039;d like to use agave nectar instead of sugar. Has anyone tried that? Web says to use 2\/3 cup agave instead of 1 cup of sugar, and to reduce liquid by 1\/4 cup. It would be blasphemous to reduce the amount of butter in the recipe, so I&#039;m thinking of either leaving out an egg or adding a little more dry ingredients... Maybe a little flax meal?","This stuff was phenomenal. I only had two bananas, so I halved the recipe and cooked it for ~40 mins. Super delicious.","100% agree, this is the best banana bread I&#039;ve made! Easy to make and delish! ??","Great recipe! Simple, and tastes wonderful! Won&#039;t need to find another recipe after this one!","Made these as muffins (18 mins at 350&deg;). SO DELICIOUS!","Absolutely delicious! This recipe is the best I have tried. It is easy and quick.  I added 3 bananas instead of 4 and added chopped walnuts.","So I don&#039;t usually write reviews, but I really thought that this warranted one...\nI&#039;ve tried so many banana bread recipes, but they have a trend of all losing their moisture very very quickly. I followed this recipe pretty much to a T, although I did 3\/4 white sugar and 1\/4 brown sugar and added a bit of extra vanilla. Also, keep in mind this is a nice dense and moist bread, so if you like something super fluffy I wouldn&#039;t use this recipe. Anyways, this recipe is so beautifully moist and yummy, and if you haven&#039;t already, you need to try it!","This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried. It is so moist and perfectly sweet. There is no reason to try another. Adding nuts in it makes it even better with no recipe adjustment needed! I love this!! I&#039;m going to try a gluten free flour this next go around. I&#039;m sure it will be just as fantastic!","Easily the best banana bread recipe I have found.","This is the best banana bread I have ever made. Delicious. I made one addition and threw in a handful of semi sweet mini chips. So moist. This recipe is a keeper.","Deliciously moist bread. I made a sweet cream cheese filling and put it in the middle of the batter and it was fantastic!  Thanks for sharing","THIS IS AMAZING!!!! So delicious!!!! So MOIST!!!! And I didn&#039;t have a loaf pan.. so I used a 9in round cake pan and it came out GREAT! Plus I added chopped walnuts. IT TASTES so good... I had it with a glass of milk too!","I&#039;ve tried a number of banana bread recipes. This one truly is the best. Simple to make and delicious.","Great recipe!!! My first time making this and it was perfect. I added pecans and cinnamon to this recipe. Delicious!!!","This is our new favorite banana bread recipe.  My son is a connoisseur and he has spoken!  I used 5 bananas, which is about an extra half cup, and it was perfect.  You can really taste the buttery banana-y flavor!","This is the best bananna bread recipe I have ever made.  So easy to make.\nI followed the recipe exactly  and it was moist and delicious.","This is THE banana bread recipe.  Tastes great! Comes out of the bundt pan perfectly every time.","My roommates and I are addicted! We take every chance we get to make this when we have a few bananas that aren&#039;t good anymore.","I will be honest, I hate baking for the holidays only because of time, lengthy recipes, so on. I really wanted to make banana bread as part of my holiday spread. I have made this recipe several times in just a week. It is so easy and delicious! I add walnuts to it. I make bread and muffins. In fact I have two loaves in the oven now! Try it, you won&#039;t be disappointed ?.","When they say &quot;you&#039;ll never need another Banana Bread Recipe again&quot;...they&#039;re absolutely right! I have been baking Banana Bread for years and have tried a number of recipes. I lost my  personal recipe book about a year ago when I took it to a friends house so I needed to look one up a couple of days before Thanksgiving and I came across this one. What caught my attention was the amount of bananas it called for. I made two loaves of it and they were gone in about 3 days and there were only four people at my house that weekend, myself included...lol. Yes...it was that good!!! Try it, you won&#039;t regret it. It&#039;s the only recipe I use now! Today is Christmas Day and I&#039;m going to visit my son and granddaughter later on today and I&#039;m bringing the Banana Bread for a treat. I love this bread!","This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried. My husband and children loved this bread.  It is the best,\nCynthia","So perfect that even the heels were delicious. I followed the recipe to a tee except for adding walnuts. This will be my go to.","Excellent.  I was going to add nuts and forgot.  I was not happy that I forgot but boy when I tasted it, even though without nuts, it was excellent.  Cooked it for 60 minutes.  I actually used my mixer to cut up bananas.  I will add 1\/2 cup of nuts from now on.  Great recipe!!","I added 3\/4 cup buttermilk to my batter, and some chopped walnuts. the buttermilk made the bread even tastier and moister..","I have made this recipe a few times now and it consistently comes out fantastic.  I made it at Thanksgiving and used it as bread with the meal, EVERYONE love it.  I have frozen it, it comes out great, I have left it in the fridge for a few days and it&#039;s great.  Perfect consistency, texture, color, and best of all SO EASY!  I don&#039;t change anything in the recipe.  Thank you so much!","Family loves this bread, it moist and yummy! I added pecans and 1\/2 tsp of cinnamon and I had to leave it in oven 15 mins more to bake.","Made it and it came out great! Replaced 1\/3 of the butter with coconut oil (cause ran out of butter). Thank you!","I&#039;ve made this several times and we love it.  Mine doesn&#039;t get done in 1 hour at 350F though.  Twice I&#039;ve had a soggy middle after I thought the toothpick test was clean.  The best way I&#039;ve found to ensure doneness is to use a thermometer.  When it gets to 190-195F, it&#039;s done.  I had to lower the oven temp to 325F so the outside didn&#039;t burn while the inside finished.  This is a dessert if you add 1 cup chopped dark chocolate!","This is a very, very simple and straightforward recipe. It yields a good-sized loaf of very tender banana bread. It kept well for 5 days in the refrigerator. I particularly enjoyed how well the edges crisped and caramelised.","I&#039;ve used this recipe many times and it is fool proof! I usually double all the ingredients besides bananas, I only use 5 bananas for a patch. If you use aluminum loaf pans for gifts it will make 3 loafs since those are tad smaller than normal loaf pans. One time I had some leftover homemade cranberry sauce and mixed it in and it was absolutely delicious! This recipe is so easy and tastes so good!!! Thank you.","very good. needed a little extra time to bake ( 10 min) and it was improved with adding 1 tsp cinnamon the second time around.","I will never make a different recipe. Incredible!","Excellent banana bread as-is. Since the recipe doesn&#039;t specify, should the butter be salted or unsalted? Since it&#039;s a baking recipe, I&#039;d assume unsalted. However, that&#039;s usually specified in the recipe and it&#039;s not in this case .","I made this banana bread yesterday, my kids loved it and it came out perfectly.","This recipe is absolutely the best.  I made it twice, once exactly per directions. Then, since I really love coconut, I reduce the sugar to 3\/4 cup and added a 1\/2 cup of coconut flakes and 1\/4 cup of pecans pieces.  It came out mouth watering delicious.  ?","If this isn&#039;t the best banana bread ever, it certainly comes close. The bread comes out of the oven nice and crispy on the outside but moist on the inside. I added some dark chocolate morsels to the batter. The recipe is simple and comes together quickly. This will be my go-to from now on, whenever I have some browning bananas.","This truly is the BEST banana bread! I absolutely love how very few ingredients it needs and is something most of us have in our pantry.  I&#039;ll never make another banana bread. This is it!!!!!!!","This really is an excellent banana bread. I added pecans! It rocked! I always know a good recipe, I start dancing when I eat it!! : )","This was the easiest banana bread recipe and it tastes awesome!  \n\nI will never use another recipe, just this one with the modification of added nuts.","Yes! One of not the best banana bread I&#039;ve ever made. Thanks for the recipe. Used my Clay loaf pan so baked 10 minutes less. Perfect!","I will be making this recipe for the second time, by request, because it was so tasty!  Thank you! Great Recipe!","If I could give it 10 stars, I would! I could seriously eat the whole 9*5 loaf to myself. This is literally the best banana bread I&#039;ve EVER had. I only used 3 bananas and the texture was perfect. I couldn&#039;t believe there was no milk in it and I had to triple check just to be sure! I am so thankful for this recipe, it&#039;s so simple and it has an amazing buttery taste, it was deliciously crispy on the outside and the texture was so perfect, I think because it had no milk. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!!!","Didn&#039;t change a thing and it was perfect.  Even after a couple days, it was still moist. Best I&#039;ve ever made or had.  It did take a little longer to bake, but every oven is different.","Best banana bread ever. I split the mixture into 2 small baking forms. Baked slightly less time. Turned out excellent !","LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!! Just add some walnuts and there you go, You got a perfect banana bread.  Thank you for the recipe.","Great recipe! I added a pinch of  cinnamon, did 3\/4 cup sugar and a quarter cup brown sugar and added crushed pecans! Everyone loved it!!!","we go through some banana bread in our household and I have a couple of recipes I like, but today, tried this one.  it&#039;s official: husband says it&#039;s his new favorite.  I anticipate my daughter will concur whens gets home from school...","Absolutely delicious!!! I just made it and it did not disappoint; and the ingredients are pretty much items you normally have in your pantry.","This recipe is so easy and the result is just scrumptious!!\nThank you for sharing the recipe! The bread is moist and tasty and so nice. \nI added walnuts to mine too, and I just looove it!!!\nAgain, Merci Beaucoup!!!!","After many attempted banana bread fails I gave up. Today I came across this recipe and gave it a shot. WOW. Its amazing, moist and EASY!!!  I didn&#039;t change a thing! Definitely will be using this recipe from now on!","I used non stick foil to line the pan and was great just lift it out cool on the counter less mess faster cooking time.","thank you for the best banana bread i ever made! actually im eating it while writing my review.. i only change the amount of sugar..  1 cup sugar will be too sweet for my taste.. instead i used only 3\/4 cup and added a little bit cinnamon. It is perfect! it is moist, fluffy, taste great, and easy to make. I recommend this recipe to everybody.. and will definitely make more of this banana bread :-) Thank you for sharing","Really yummy! Very moist and we added chocolate chips per kid requests!  Good add in! Will make again for sure.","Oh em gee. Best banana bread I&#039;ve ever tasted. I made 2 loaves at once so doubled the ingredients (I only had 7 very overly ripe bananas). I did use self rising flour instead of AP but only because I am too lazy to sift, and honestly I&#039;ve never been able to tell a difference in substituting one for the other. I baked for 50 minutes and a toothpick inserted had a little bit of goo so I just turned off the oven and let them sit inside for the next 10 minutes. It makes this phenomenol outside crust that came out of the pan completely intact, and sliced perfectly with a serrated bread knife. I love to cook\/bake and I have to say this is one of my greatest accomplishments  ever! A+++++!!!!!","Absolutely delicious ?. I added cinnamon and sugar to the top. So yummy","I doubled this recipe to accommodate my large family. It made one large loafs and two medium loafs. The only changes I made were white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and I added about 1\/2 c of oat bran to it. It&#039;s fantastic, though maybe just a bit too sweet. The kids are all over it! I&#039;ll be making it again for sure","Yep!  Turned out perfect, looked like the picture and tasted even better.","This was so simple and amazing. I added a bit of shredded dark chocolate to kick it up a notch. Even without the chocolate it is sure to please.","This recipe is terrible! I had to cover the top of the loaf with foil after 45 minutes as it was starting to burn. After an hour, it was still wet in the middle. Left for a further 15 minutes until the cake tester came out clean. On turning out, the bottom half of the loaf remained in the tin! Just a disaster! I bake a lot and this is by far the worst result for my efforts- such a waste of ingredients.","This recipe is really great! So much so that I have made this recipe 3 times this month. It's very moist and not overly dense like my old banana bread recipe which called for more flour and baking powder. I follow the recipe exactly and pour into a 9 x 9 glass pan and bake for 45 minutes. Today I made 1.5 times the recipe and used a 9 x 13 glass pan and it was also ready in about 45 minutes. I also used coconut oil instead of butter and it tasted just as good. This recipe is a keeper for sure!","Best Banna Bread I've Ever Eaten! Instead of vanilla extract o added almond extract and it was the most delicious dessert I've ever eaten! My boyfriend and I ate both loaves in a day! We had to make MORE the next day! Delicious!","I have made and eaten a lot of banana bread over the years. This recipe is hands down one of the best that I have used. It was an instant hit with my family. I made one modification: I only use 2 bananas as we like a bread where the banana flavor is not too strong. Two bananas add the perfect amount of fruit flavor without being overpowering. Thanks, lkadlec for a fantastic recipe!","I just made this but added 1\/2 cup chopped walnuts. Hands down - the best Banana Bread I've ever made. My husband agrees.","Perfect recipe. The bread was so delicious and stayed moist for days. I did end up needing to add a few minutes of baking time for it to be fully done but that could change depending on the pan, climate, etc., So absolutely nothing to complain about. I will definitely be saving this recipe for future loafs of banana bread.","This is honestly the BEST Banana Bread recipe I have ever made! My boys buy extra bananas at the store in hopes that I will make this every week! (I added walnuts as well!)","I made this just like it reads. (except sifting, I didn't have a sifter so I forked it together) I baked it exactly 1 hour and removed it with out even checking it. It is probably the BEST recipe I have found to date. It's simplicity makes it all that much better!","This is my favorite banana bread recipe. I use it every single time. I add chocolate and pecans.","This is a Banana bread I have made a number of times, already- including right now! I added walnuts, this time! But, it is wonderful, moist and very YUMMO!&divide;","Super moist. My husband doesn't like the crunch of the walnuts so I ground a handful and mixed it in. He had to eat some while it was warm and we've both had 2 slices because it's so delicious.","Best I've ever had . Added cranberry raisins to be different .","I dont understand why some people are getting mushy banana bread and why some people are getting it perfect but unfortunatly after 1hr at 350 mine was still mushy in middle. Outside looked well done. I dont know what to say I followed the recipe to the T and it was a flop....","This recipe was AMAZING!!! so moist and yummy. I put crushed toasted coconut almonds in my batter and it gave it the perfect crunch . Thank you for sharing!","Easy, perfect, so good.","Like many others, I've been searching for a &quot;fool proof&quot; banana bread recipe. This is it! I've tried it twice now. The second time, I added walnuts. With or without, it comes out perfect. Thank you!","I have been looking for a good banana recipe for a long time and this one truly is the best one I've found. I followed the directions exactly and it was delicious. Next time I might add some walnuts but that's all I might change.","Excellent. I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.","THE BEST banana bread for me.with super easy preparations and basic ingredients,it was my first time to try baking but the outcome suprised me!thank you for the recipe! \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd","This bread and is delicious.","This is the recipe I always use. I sub margarine and it comes out great. Also sprinkle turbinado sugar on top before baking for and added crunch. This recipe really produces reliable results.","This wasn't the best banana bread I've baked. Next time I'll use 3 ripe bananas to avoid it becoming so","Delicious recipe! Cut baking time by 10 minutes for a moister bread.","I love this recipe","This recipe is amazing! The banana bread turned out to be really moist and flavorful. Thanks for sharing!!","This, BY FAR, is up there in the YUMMMMM department!!!!!!! \ufffd\ufffd Coming from someone who has got the burnt thing down pat, calling this an easy recipe is *absolutely correct*!!! I followed the recipe\/instructions to the T and ended up with a ~Heavenly~ loaf of (ba) Nana goodness!!! I'll most certainly be making again, and again, and... A BABILLION THANK YOUS for sharing!!!!!!!","I just made this!!! I absolutely love this recipie! My family took one bite of it and said &quot;wow, Tayler! This is really good!&quot; I'm so happy I found this. I added blueberries to it too!","Awsome banana bread recipe, easy to follow. Taste fantastic. You gotta try it !","My banana bread came out delicious first time making one.\ufffd\ufffd","Followed the recipe except margerine instead of butter. Used cupcake pan with paper baking cups (couldn't find my loaf pan). First 12 normal recipe, then added 1\/2 tsp cinnamon and 1\/2 cup mini chocolate chips for the second batch (so double that for the full recipe). Cooked at 350, checked with toothpick, 25 minutes total. Cooled on baking rack 1\/2 hour. Made 24 total. Soft and moist, not gooey. Did not rise much at all, flat top not rounded. Both are very good, but I'm leaning towards the choc chip \/ cinnamon version.","This recipe certainly doesn't need another review! I've been baking banana bread for over 50 years. This is definitely the best banana bread I've ever made! This replaces my old recipe as a favorite. I added 3\/4 cup of finely chopped pecans. It makes 8 little mini loaves. Love the crust!!!","I added chopped pecans and an extra banana. This was by far the best banana bread I\u2019ve ever had!!","Decided to try my hand at baking. Had bananas but needed a recipe. Loved this one so much I made 3 loaves! Quick, easy and tasty.","I made it tonight exactly how it's written!!! YUMMY!! It's the best banana bread I have ever had!! I will be making this again!!","We made 4 batches today because our banana tree gave us lots of fruit. We added walnuts and this is tne most delicious recipe we have ever tried. Lots of banana flavor and the vanilla was great at enhancing the flavor.","It really is the best banana bread! I use spelt flour and add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a little extra vanilla and my son loves it. I'd like to try with coconut flour next.","Soft and delicious. Perfect texture and just the right amount Of banana","Have only made this recipe two times, but it is the best banana bread recipe I've ever tried!!! Added an extra banana...wonderful!!! What I like best is that the recipe is so EASY. Thank you so much.","This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever tried. I have used it year after year and have even used the same recipe with zucchini instead! Delicious!","I have been baking for a while and a lot of banana bread in between. By far, this is one of the simplest banana breads I've ever baked and one of the best!!! I substituted coconut oil for the butter and used pastry flour, sprinkled some walnuts and bam!","We love it, easy to follow , it is moist and tasty! For the healthier recipe, 1)I use 3\/4 cup of coconut sugar replace o 1 cup of white sugar. 2) I use grape seed oil replace butter. This is my choice only. I will keep this recipe! Thank you very much!","The directions where super unclear but other that that it was super \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd","I folded in frozen raspberries at the end, my husband LOVED it. It was delicious. Will be making again.","Great recipe. Add about a half teaspoon of cinnamon, half cup of walnuts, and a quarter cup of walnuts reserved for the top. Make sure to crush walnuts with a kitchen mallet or hammer inside of 2 Ziplock bags. Thank you for the recipe. Casey","Easy, simple, bakes quick and tastes delicious. I made this as gifts for others and got great reviews. I will probably keep this as my go-to recipe for banana bread since I always seem to have lots of frozen bananas stored. Thank you!","I was surprised at how moist this banana bread was. I have shared this recipe with multiple friends. Love it.","Pretty good recipe, really convenient to make. Just don't be an idiot like me and dump the pan right after taking it out of the oven.","I've tried a few recipes and I like this one the best. It is sweet but not too sweet that I can't eat it for breakfast, warm with a touch of butter. My husband has me add chocolate chips for him sometimes, but I much prefer it plain. It only makes one loaf, which is a lot of bananas for one loaf. But worth it. My husband isn't a big banana bread person and he will even eat this, chocolate chips or not.","This is truly the best banana bread recipe. The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle a little brown sugar on the top before baking.","AMAZING !!! add a handful of walnuts and you have found heaven! So delicious Thank You ! No more reading through recipes to find the perfect one, it\\ been found !","Taste really great but I must have done something wrong.. It was over cooked on the bottom and almost undercooked on the top. How do I fix this?","I added another banana, cinnamon and chocolate. I had a little extra batter which I cooked in a small round dish and tasted right out of the oven. It's almost like a bread pudding, really good........","I don't usually write reviews but this banana bread turned out so good that I had to write one. My husband couldn't believe that I made it because it tasted like it came from a bakery lol. He loved it so much he ate half the loaf lol. I will DEFINATELY be making this again!! :)","Never made banana bread before. Followed this recipe and it came out perfectly.","I have tried different recipes, but this one was a HIT! Everyone in my family loved. I added ginger, nutmeg and walnut, the cake was extremely moist even though I left it for 10min extra. You will definitely love it and do not have to search anymore like I have. Thank you for a great recipe.","It was the first time I tried banana bread and this came out fantastic. Simple and perfect the first time. Alterations: I added walnuts to get some extra crunch. The baking soda we get in India is probably more potent, I used 1\/2 teaspoon only with good results. Next time, I would reduce the sugar to 3\/4 th cup too.","Wow! I'm very impressed! Moist, full of flavor, few ingredients and easy! Finally the kind of banana bread I had hope for, just banana taste and no cinnamon or nutmeg overwhelming. I won't change a thing of this recipe, except for personal taste, I will maybe use a little less butter, a little less sugar and cook 5 to 10 minutes less because of individual oven. Thanks for a winning recipe!","I made this recipe and it turned out amazing! I subsituted regular butter for light butter as well as used truvia cooking sugar instead of regular sugar and Unbleached all purpose flour. Still tasted amazing, best and easiest banana bread I have ever made!!!","Great recipe. I add a tbls of cinnamon, pecans and walnuts. Family fav!","Terrible recipe! It doesn't not call for enough flour and my banana bread sunk in the middle and was too moist. I would avoid and find a better recipe on the net.","terrible and discusting","Great recipe. Threw in some walnuts and dried cherrys, perfect with some salted sweet cream butter and 5 seconds in the microwave!","Im a huge lover of this recipe. I make it all the time....wont ever use another banana bread recipe again! Yum!","I can't believe I'm using butter instead of oil in this recipe, as I have always used oil. I seperate my egg whites and whip them to a peak , till stiff and fold them in last then poured dough in to baking pan to bake. It helps to have very moist bread","This is very yummy....made one in the afternoon and shared it and had to make another that evening.","Great Recipe! I tweaked it just a bit. I substituted half of the sugar for brown sugar, added nuts and topped the loaf with mini chocolate chips before baking. The bread was moist, light and very delicious. I will definitely use the recipe again in the future.","This was the best most moist banana bread I have ever eaten! ! I didn't have any nuts to put in it so I had some mini chocolate chips so I sprinkled some into the batter and it was SO good. I just made it this morning and it's almost gone. Great","Perfect recipe","I love banana bread and have tried upwards of 20 recipes looking for the best one. This is it! No matter what recipe I try, I always come back to this one. Easy, uncomplicated and amazing.","Really good recipe! I usually can't find a good recipe for banana bread, but this one beats them all!","Delicious! Have made a few banana bread recipes and this is the best - moist and delicious!",null,"First time making a banana bread and it turned out absolutely delicious, moist and yummy looking. My kids absolutely loved it.","In the oven right now....hope it is as good as my mom's. My very first time making banana bread so here's hoping it turns out.","I've made this twice now, the first time as the recipe is written, and the second time with a couple alterations to make it slightly healthier. Both are AMAZING!! The alterations I did the second time were doubling it, subbing the regular flour for almond flour, reducing the sugar &amp; butter by 1\/4 cup each (so 3\/4c butter, 1 &amp; 3\/4c sugar), and adding an extra egg. Baking time &amp; temperature were the same. I bake a lot, and with, or without alterations to this recipe, it's amazing! Definitely a keeper!","Uh...it's still in my oven! Ok all you experts... Apparently the amount you put in the bread pan MATTERS. And a rookie like me just filled the darn things up using all the batter....and I now have a hazmat\/fire situation overflowing in my brand new oven... UGH! So... A little help on how much the thing will expand would've been nice :-\/ Also, an exact measurement of banana would be better than &quot;4 bananas&quot;...It smells good :-)","This banana bread saved my life from a crazed trivia-obsessed murderer. 5 stars, but having an exact measurement for the bananas would have been nice.","I've made this cake 2 times and my whole family loves it. I used 4 medium size bananas (they were about 7&quot; long) and salted butter, I also added the salt that the recipe asks for and it always turns out GREAT! I leave it in the oven a little longer (for about 1 hour and 10 minutes) because I like it to be a little darker. I never add any nuts or change anything else since I think the recipe it's perfect the way it is.","Very good!!!!","Delicious! I added 1\/4 tsp of cinnamon to give it a little extra flavor. Definitely will make this recipe again.","It didn't turn out, not done in the inside...I followed the directions what went wrong?","This is a great banana bread, this is now replacing my previous go-to recipe! This one uses white sugar instead of brown which my other one does, I like the 'lighter' flavour of this.","The best banana bread ever.","took no time, except cooking time, super easy and delicious recipe, moist and doesn't have near as much butter as most other recipes. I altered it and it was still fantastic - used coconut oil instead of butter, used einkhorn flour and succanat instead of others, added walnuts and chocolate chips. Very delicious easy banana bread!","Very good and moist.","Awesome. Only baked it for 45 minutes. Always put the timer on before the actual recommended time to make sure. It was done at 45","I actually doubled the recipe for a much larger loaf tin and it was still perfect. Best banana loaf!","Very very dense bannna bread , I would have to say that the person who recommended using walnuts is a genies . The walnuts make it great . I tried this instead of my normal one , I would recommend the recipe from food network and adding the walnuts .","Love this recipe, walnuts are great, but I also throw in some raisins and a few chopped dates at times, dried cranberries are good to add some festive color.","I did a half portion because I had only two bananas. I also used 6cup cake pan and one small rectangular loaf pan,7 servings. Smells so good in the oven. As they say the taste of the pudding is in the eating,so waiting","This is THE BEST and easiest banana bread ever! I didn't have regular sugar so I used brown sugar instead but other than that I followed exact recipe and I swear I died after the first bite...So yummy! Oh and I did 6 bananas because they were very ripe and didnt want to throw away.","So good. Don't look any further for a banana bread recipe! I did however follow a few tweaks to get my delish final result. This turned out better than almost anything I've ever baked!","I just popped it in the oven shall see","By far the best banana bread recipe ! If u like chocolate , I added chocolate chips to recipe, Dee lish!!!","Loved this recipe! I added some walnuts, pepitas and about 1\/4 of linseed meal to give it some crunch. It is super moist and delicious. Will definitely be saving this recipe for another time.","Best banana bread ever! I would recommend adding about 1\/2 cup of crushed walnuts for more flavor. Just remember to let the bread cool in the pan before dumping it out because I made that mistake and it turned into a pile of gooey bread. And if you don't have sugar you can use honey. For one cup of sugar add 3\/4 and one tablespoon of honey. I tried this and it turned out great!","I figured aww what the heck.. I've done all the cooking, bout time I start baking - I've got everything I need PLUSSSS MORE.","Yep. It's the best! I added ground flax seed and walnuts. Loved it. This is my &quot;go to&quot; banana bread recipe for sure!!!","This Banana Bread is fantastic!","Awesome banana bread! Would recommend to anyone!","I have made this banana bread about 10 times now and every time it's a winner! I have over time made slight adjustments to make it healthier and it has remained the best recipe yet. To do that, I halved the sugar content to half a cup and used rice syrup instead and replaced the wheat flour with spelt which is more nutritious. I've played around with replacing the butter with coconut oil and this works really well. Then tonight I made it again and used olive oil instead (1\/4 cup + 2tbs) and only added 1\/3 cup of rice syrup and threw in some choc chips too. It's the winning recipe so far!","Very delish! I didn't notice anything real different with the recipe but it's fantastic. I sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on top before baking and it's perfect mmmmmmm. So moist with a nice crisp on the outside.","Fantastic recipe! Great banana taste and just the right amount of moisture - perfect every time!!","I added chocolate chips, 4 bananas and used stevia instead of sugar. Can't wait till it cools!","This is such an easy recipe, perfect if you're in a hurry. It's delicious as well! I put in only 1\/2 cup of sugar, that is plenty sweet enough, because the bananas have so much sugar in them anyway. Leave the butter in - it's healthy! Just don't use margarine:( My mother taught me to pat wet hands on top of the cake before you put it in the oven - the extra moisture makes the cake top lovely and crunchy.","In a recent move, I misplaced my old recipe file with my mother's banana bread recipe in it. I found this one and tried it, only to discover that it tasted exactly like my mom's! When I found the file box, I compared recipes, and they were identical, with the exception that my mom didn't put quite as much sugar in her banana bread. I love to make muffins and take them with me to work for a snack. Did you know my mom? Did she give you her recipe, too? This is a &quot;never can fail&quot; recipe!!","Great and easy recipe. Followed recipe ingredients but doubled it. Made half into muffins and the other half into the bread adding chocolate chips and almond slices. My family ate the whole thing before I could get a picture. Perfect balance btw moist and light. Definite keeper, my new go to banana bread recipe.","So easy a six-year old can do it. I made this recipe with my son today. To be honest, I was drawn to this recipe due to it's simple ingredients and straightforward directions. We doubled the recipe and made two loaves based on the positive reviews...And plus, our family loves loves banana bread. We made two loaves from the doubled recipe: one as directed and one with walnuts. Our bake was a bit over (too brown), but we got two moist loaves. Not quite sweet enough for our tastes. However, it will still make a great partner to my morning coffee or my kiddos glass of milk. I'd suggest two adjustments: adding 1\/3 cup sugar when doubling the recipe and reducing the bake time by 5-10 minutes. My son and I will definitely make this recipe again (with those minor adjustments).","My family and I agreed this was the best banana bread we'd ever had! And so easy to make. Only thing I changed was I used a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar. Also added some chocolate chips and chopped pecans, (about 1\/2 cup each.) And before baking, I mixed three Tablespoons of brown sugar with one Tablespoon of water and brushed that over the top of the loaf. It gave it a nice crunchy topping. A tip I discovered when I realized I only had three super-ripe, blackened bananas and the recipe called for four. I took one of the yellow bananas, cut it into chunks and put it in a pan with a little water and sugar. Baked it at 350 for about three or four minutes. It was &quot;mushy&quot; and sweet, just like a super-ripe banana after I did that. Also, to ensure even baking of the entire loaf, it helps to put the loaf pan in a larger baking pan. Fill the larger baking pan with a few inches of water and put it in the oven for the recommended time. The center of the loaf will be totally baked and the outsides will not be overly dry.","The loaf wasn't even half gone and I was already getting requests to make more. Looks like this will be a staple around my house. A quick note that I changed one cup of white sugar to one half cup white sugar, one half cup light brown sugar. I also combined brown sugar and water for a crunchy topping and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of that. Absolutely divine!","This recipe was perfect and easy. The only changes I made was adding chocolate chips to the final mixture before pouring into the pan, and browning the butter in a skillet before creaming together with the sugar. Best banana bread I've ever had, hands down.","Found this recipe and tried it. I had great results. I liked this recipe so much and found this it very easy and adaptable so I experimented with other ingredients and had great luck. I used grated up apples and added cinnamon. turned out great!!!","WOW !! Best banana bread ever so moist!! I added 1 cup of walnuts but other then that it was perfect!","I just made this Banana bread tonight Took some of the ideas of brushing the top with water \/ Brown sugar mixture...very nice... The huge issue, is that I did what Dog Mama suggested, and put the loaf pan into another pan with water, in hopes of getting a done centre but not dry top...well...that was a fail! The top is great, but the entire bottom 1\/2 of the bread is totally raw!! Ugh! It was not evident when I did the toothpick test, since the loaf pan is deeper than the toothpick, it seemed perfect....OMG! Now it's cooling, and horrible and don't know how to fix it! :(","Banana bread is way too wet! it turned out very mushy like mash potatoes... i'll find a better recipe","Definitely awesome!!! Served as a dessert with raspberry glaze and vanilla ice cream.","Followed directions to a &quot;T&quot; and bread wasn't baked in the middle. I did use an aluminum bread pan so maybe that's why, but I was pretty disappointed. I put it back in and left it longer and it still wasn't cooked. End pieces were good though!","Ok, this was absolutely delicious, I mean if you want it to be extremely moist. I used a glass pan and 4 ripe but not over ripe bananas. I see what others are saying about the moisture, mine was fully baked crunchy and sweet crust but butter-like soft and extremely decadent and moist center. I loved it! Looks like a banana brownie lol I did tweak it a bit","Made this banana bread this morning. Turned out wonderful. I just added walnuts and a tad of cinnamon. Will definitely make this recipe again.","Absolutely the best recipe out there. Simple too!! I added cinnamon only because I always add cinnamon too my banana bread. I baked it for exactly 1 hour at 350 degrees, it came out very moist with a nice crust. Holds together perfectly. I will always make this recipe.","This recipe is amazingly delicious and moist! It's easy to make and turns out every time. I do fold in 3\/4 cup chopped pecans and top with 3 tbsps finely chopped pecans before baking. Other then that I follow the recipe. Anytime my family sees very ripe bananas they ask me to make it.","Delicious! Just wasn't cooked completely in center. Not sure if pan made a difference or something else. I used Temptations loaf pan and always love how they cook. Any ideas?","My son and I just made this recipe today and we love it! So yummy and very moist! Since I did this with my lil guy he wanted some dark chocolate chips in it so we lessened the sugar too and voila still delicious! Next time I'll add some walnuts and cinnamon. Thank you for sharing this very simple recipe. Here it is fresh from the oven...","Used 1\/4 tsp Salt 4 Life (salt substitute) and 1\/4 tsp kosher salt to reduce the sodium. Also used 4 bananas. Great!","I've used this recipe several times, and it always turns out fantastic- great flavor &amp; moist. I've used 3-4 bananas each time. Also added chopped walnuts &amp; chocolate chips. It's just me &amp; my husband that eat it, so most of the time I use the small loaf pans that come in sets of 4. Then I freeze them within a quart size freezer bag. So convenient. Thaws quickly &amp; is so delicious. Great recipe!","Made gluten free by using gf flour and added about 1\/4 cup more flour plus,the 4 bananas. Turned out great in little loaf pans baked at 325 for 35 min","I did not have any butter so I used oil. I didnt have any vanilla so I used vriwn sugar and it was absulutely amazing!!","Very moist and very very very good!","Seriously- best banana bread ever! I used 4 bananas.","Tried this recipe. Turned out fine, but not as good as the reviews had suggested. This recipe is definitely lacking flavour. More bananas would be a good choice. Perhaps a bit of cinnamon as well. It cooked thoroughly and tastes fine. My boyfriend enjoyed it!","Try sprinkling brown sugar over the batter after pouring it in to your loaf pan. The brown sugar will caramelize, adding a wonderful crunchy texture to the soft, moist (if you hate that word, sorry - help me find a synonym!) texture of the bread.","Good morning. I don't have a loaf pan. Can you advise another size? I do have some mini disposable loaf pans. How far would I fill those?","Best recipe ever !!!!!! Add a whole stick of butter !!","Find a recipe and always tweak it and make it yours. I added extra bananas for flavor (extra ripe is sweet and you won't have to add all the sugar. I added 1\/2 the sugar and it was still sweet). I also added a tbs. of cinnamon and walnuts. The best banana bread recipe ever! All of my coworkers loved it. Making more for Monday morning with coffee and tea.","This is by far the best banana bread I have made. I also doubled the recipe and added a few milk chocolate chips and some pecan peices also made muffins!! Everybody loved them. I also added pumpkin spice.","The top quote is correct - this is the perfect starting point for banana bread. I took the author's advice and used 4 bananas. I also took the amount of sugar down to 1\/2 cup. Instead of a loaf pan, I made 12 muffins, which needed 30 minutes in the oven. For variety, I put in half the batter, added walnuts, almonds, chocolate chips or ginger bits to each cup (just a bit!) and topped the cups with the rest of the batter. They were perfect!","I added frozen blueberries and loved this!","I can't stop laughing,.. I never store pans in my oven but just yesterday i put a baking pan in and totally forgot about it. When I read the 1st instruction on this recipe I was floored!! Thank you so much and it came out awesome!!","Great Recipe:) The measurements are perfect and i used 4 bananas like you mentioned and it was very moist, which is how i like my banana bread:))) thank you","Wow this best bananas bread that ever had made in my life. It's no too sweet and very moist. I have added crushed walnut inside of the batter as well as on top it's adds additional crunch. Yum, yum and yum again. I highly recommend for u the reader to try it is easy and very tasty. I have served the banana bread with home made wipped cream and my family were all in heaven!!! Thank you very much Ikadlec for sharing this simple but wonderfull recipe.","Very tasty banana bread. Didn't make any substitutions but maybe will add some nuts next time. Thanks for the recipe. Also very easy to make.","Cooked this tonight... not sure about the taste yet... but pulled it out ten minutes early and it's burnt around the edges.. my oven was running at 350 and it was in for an hour... anyone else run into this? Bummer :( I've never had issues with my oven being too hot....","This was my first time making banana bread and I'm so pleased with the outcome, almost tastes like my great grandmothers! I added some cinnamon chocolate morsels because someone gave them to me and I had no clue what I was going to use them in. This was pretty amazing and it's totally going in my recipe collection!","Love this recipe! I love how you say to &quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven.&quot; It's like you know me!","Just made it and it was a success! My family doesn't like bananas but they loved the banana bread!","It came out really ?? good, even though I mixed everything in the mixer at once and the recipe said not to overmix it. I didn't see that part at first. Still came out really really delicious. Everyone loved it.","Everyone loves this banana bread, even my mom and she is a hard critic...but I add to it. I add a tsp of cinnamon, a bit of chocolate chips and walnuts.","Such simple perfection! Lots of tweaks possible to suit your taste","This recipe is the best one! Bread came out so moist and delicious. I did the 4 bananas, added some chocolate chips and baked it for an additional 10 mins, the center was not done after 60 mins. Yumm!!","Absolutely delicious. My go-to recipe for old bananas!","This was delicious! I put in 4 bananas, it came out tasty and moist with a wonderfully crispy crust! The flavor was amazing! I have absolutely nothing to complain about and everything to praise it for! I will try adding walnuts or pecans and\/or chocolate chips next time, I'm sure it will be great that way too.","Soooo I'm currently making this, but my oven only goes as high as 250 degrees. So I've been cooking it on that for 15 mins and it's going really dark on the top... do I turn it down? Highly doubt I'll get a response before it's either burnt or delicious ?? It just looks a bit too dark???","Has anyone tried adding ground Chia or flax seed to the recipe?","I substituted wheat free gluten free flour and 1\/4 cup sugar. DELICIOUS!!!!!!","This was amazing!! I've tried so many times to make banana bread and it always comes out yucky. In this recipe I used almond extract since I didn't have vanilla and it was a great compromise. I will definitely try with vanilla","I have not yet tried this recipe I just found it, but I have to say this is the first and possibly only recipe Ive seen that starts with &quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven.&quot; Thank you so much for letting me know im not the only one who keeps pots in my oven!! ??","Added a few tablespoons of cocoa powder and baked for 20 min in muffin tins. A+","Fabulous recipe that is amenable to tweaking. I wanted to raise the nutritional bar, so I added 1 tablespoon of flax &amp; wheat germ, (each) 1\/4 cup oatmeal, 1 tsp. cinnamon &amp; cloves, and one finely chopped pear. Delicious and moist!","East recipe to follow.. turned out dense &amp; nice.. a little tad too sweet though.. the kids loved it!","This is my go-to banana bread recipe. No alterations, but occasionally put it in a muffin tin instead of a loaf pan. Very moist. Perfect and simple!","I must have done something wrong. Instead of doing a loaf I made muffins and well I had to take them out at 33 minutes or they were going to burn. There wasn't much flavor either. I think I might have over mixed them. Also the bananas I had frozen previously so that might have been the downfall. The muffins were super dark. Will try it again with fresh bananas and not over mix. I was super excited to try this recipe.","Best Banana Recipe - moist and tasty. I added walnuts and chopped dates. You will love it too.","Doubled recipe replacing with brown sugar. Added 1\/4 cup both white chocolate chips and raisins. Super moist. Will try with walnuts next time.","I used a little less butter by 3tbs and followed the rest of ingredient list. I also lowered the oven temp by 25 degrees and cooked it 15 mins longer. The bread turned out beautiful. It gets quite dark in oven, don't be fooled it's done, use a toothpick to test. The lower temperature and added time allowed the crust to become slightly crisp and the inside was perfectly done.","Very good banana bread, I would like the calories and ingredients count if at all possible. Thank you","I've made this recipe several times, and it always comes out wonderfully! I always use four bananas and bake mine in a 9&quot; x 5&quot; loaf pan. I read online (elsewhere) that banana bread is best baked when an instant-read thermometer reaches 195&deg; to 205&deg;F in the center. For me, that takes between 60-75 minutes. I've had success with the recipe as written as well as swapping out the white sugar for brown and\/or adding walnuts. Has anyone tried using maple syrup instead of sugar?","Amazing banana bread!! I will not be Googling another banana bread recipe. This recipe delivers a mouthful of wonderful. No change to the recipe because it is perfect just the way it is. After we devoured my first loaf, I baked 3 loaves for sealing and freezing. I cut them in half for sealing. When I take them out to thaw, a half loaf usually lasts 2-3 days. I am a sealing maniac... Love it for my baked goodies! The pots and pans reminder at the beginning of the recipe is priceless. ?","Just made this and it turned out really good! I had 4 over ripe bananas staring at me and just had to make something yummy instead of the usual freezing the bananas for smoothies. Not that smoothies are not yummy. Read most of the reviews and took note of some suggestions and tweaks. I used 1\/2 c reg sugar, 1\/4 c brown sugar plus 2 tbsp maple syrup. Also added 1\/2 c coconut flour to replace 1\/2 c APF. I wanted to follow the recipe to a T but was feeling a bit adventures and was happy with the result. Although it didn't rise as much as I hope it would, probably due to the added maple syrup? Or the coconut flour? What ever the reason, it still turned out great! Thanks for the recipe! Will surely make this again n again, maybe add nuts or choc chips next time?","I'm making it now. Simple to make and the batter tastes awesome. Also the smell in my kitchen is just wonderful. I'm hoping it tastes just as good. I used 4 bananas. Just had some and it is banging. I'll definitely use this one from now on. I live in phoenix az","This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever used the only thing I did different is I put chocolate chips in it and it only made it better! The whole house smells wonderful! Thank you for the recipe it was very easy to make.","Just made this today instead of bread I made muffins out of the batter baked them for 20 mins I used 4 bananas as it said you could use my daughter took them to work and everyone loved them the best they ever had Thanks for Sharing this I will be making these for the rest of my family","I've tried so many recipes trying to find the closest thing to my grandmother's banana bread and usually I am left a bit disappointed. Not this time! It turned out moist, dense, and deliciously simple, which makes it perfect!","Was delicious. Used 4 ripe bananas. Was almost done at 50 minutes. Put my loaf dish in microwave with small piece of foil over top ends of cake, cooked for 2 minutes to get the gooey middle cooked and was perfect. I sprinkled sugar across top before baking and made nice crust. Will make again.","I had a fresh pineapple waiting to be used so chopped half that up and tossed it in. My loaves rose WAY more than I've ever seen. Such a versatile recipe!!","I took some reviewer's advice and substituted 1 cup of sugar with 1\/2 cup of sugar and 1\/2 cup of brown sugar. I used 4 bananas and mixed in some chopped pecans. I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top before baking. It is delicious! Thanks for the recipe!","My granddaughter &amp; I loved it! I use half the sugar &amp; extra ripe bananas (4), which substitutes for some of the sugar. Thanks for a delish recipe!","My 3rd try and it gets better every time. I add 1\/4 cup of ground flax seed. I also use 1 cup white &amp; 1\/2 cup whole wheat. I double and freeze the extra loaf for later. :-) My house smells good!","I have only made 2 recipes for banana bread in my life, this one and the most popular on allrecipes.com that has sour cream in it. I enjoyed that one but found it a bit dense and heavy but also great. This one,however is my favorite. Its moist and flavorful. I follow it exactly although i have done 3.5 or 4 bananas. My issue is that the outside is very brown and on the well done side but the center is mush. Im thinking its mostly my oven but I have read some peoples reviews that say to bake longer. I dont know how i can do that without having it too brown. Anyway i love this one and recommend it as is. I added semi sweet chocolate chips the last 2 times, which makes it more decadent. Enjoy!","This truly is the best - I'm sure it's all the butter, but it's delicious!! I cooked a bit longer in a stoneware pan, but as long as the middle didn't come out gooey with a toothpick, I knew when it was done. I let it cool in the pan.","Awesome!","How do I know if I over mixed it?? Will it not come out good? It's a little runny. Is that normal.","Super happy with this recipe! I used three bananas as that's what I had; it came out perfect. I could easily imagine it being just as good but wetter with four, and\/or just as good but less sweet with less sugar. Or adding chocolate chips and making it into a true dessert. But this was just the perfect basic, classic recipe that I was hoping for. One to save and reuse for sure!","I really like this recipe. I tweaked it a bit by adding 1\/2 C of Sugar (granulated) and 1\/2 C of dark brown sugar for a deeper richness. Delicious!","It's gorgeous! My VERY FIRST PROJECT, that I actually went through with. I have only tasted a little piece, but I know it's going to be amazing. Thank u for the wonderful recipe, now no more bananas have to go to waste in my home!! #PROUDMOMMY!!","It turned out great!!!!! I loved it! My family loved it! I only changed one thing and that was adding chocolate chips to it, you can always add a little chocolate!","Amazing but see my tweak and that made it better than than it ever will be","I'm wondering how long I should bake if I want muffins instead of a loaf?","This was a great recipe! I followed it directly, using four bananas for a richer taste as suggested. I did add one cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. I placed my batter into dark muffin tins and baked at 350 for 22 minutes(easier for storage)! These came out light, fluffy, and delicious! I will be making this recipe again.","I didn't change anything. I made this EXACTLY like the recipe states and it turned out GREAT.","Best ever! I made a double batch of this banana bread -which made 1 loaf and 24 muffins. Yes I had to tweak the recipe, I added a cup of chocolate hazelnut spread - I reduced the butter to 1\/2 cup, and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. My bananas were so ripe - they melted into the batter. I will definitely make this again and again! Its moist, its great toasted, it's a simple and best of all its delicious.","Turned out incredible....only thing was it took about ten minutes longer to bake than suggested in a 4x8 load pan. Otherwise....fantastic!","What size loaf pan does everyone use?","I'm not a fan of bananas but I can't get enough of this recipe. I reduced the sugar to half a cup and added half a teaspoon of cinnamon and crushed walnuts. I once ran out of vanilla but it was still delicious. It works well with an 8x8 pa and muffin tins as well although you need to be careful not to overcook the muffins or they dry out","This is a delicious recipe. Love making muffins for the kids and small loaves for friends. I also add a teaspoon of cinnamon.","A straight forward with amazing results. Love it!!","Soo good &amp; moist! Used 1\/2c white sugar &amp; 1\/2c brown. 1\/4 tsp of salt instead because last time I made it I could taste it. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top &amp; 4 bananas instead of 3.","Absolutely easy to make and delicious!","Super easy! Absolutely delish! All I add is a 1\/2 tsp. of nutmeg and viola! Mama comes out as dessert making champion! Love it. Thank you for sharing this recipe!","It came out amazing. Super easy and so moist! I added chocolate chips and crushed walnuts!","Loved the recipe. I just used the hand mixer to mash up the bananas and mix them in. My bread however was over done on the bottom, and the toothpick came out wet after 55 mins so I had to bake an extra 5 mins. I need to figure that out..maybe lower baking temp.?","It's really really good, I just used 2 bananas, 1 cup flour, copped walnut and added 4 tsp coffee in 2tbsp hot water, OMG it was the best bread and it was awesome","This is the first and only recipe to use online. It's simple, you can add any kind of nuts or not, add chocolate chips for a dessert-like bread and even coconut. Yummy good.","I gave this a try last week because I was unable to find my wife's tried and true banana bread recipe. Well, it turned out great and she approved! The following are the changes I made... - used 4 bananas - reduced salt to 1\/4 tsp - substituted 1\/2 c granulated sugar and 1\/2c brown sugar - added 1 tbsp cinnamon - baked in a 9x9 pan for about 30 min","This bread was gone before it finished cooling! Made it w It's gluten free flour and had to cook it about 10 minutes longer, but my husband couldn't even tell it was gf! He went to the store and bought a bunch of over ripe bananas! Try this!","I use a mini loaf pan. Keep an eye on it though. You won't need to bake as long. Also I add dark chocolate chips, blueberries, crushed walnuts, or any combination of those three. By using the mini loaf pan, they're so moist you dont even need to put butter on it. People love them!","My son and husband absolutely loved this banana bread recipe! I too added dark chocolate chips! This will be my forever go to recipe to make for friends s and family. Forgot to add stars would give 10 but only five there to choose from!","I love this nice and moist I add pecans they are sweeter than Walnut and don't have a bite.","I made cupcakes with this recipe. It took about 20-22 min to bake. They were very moist &amp;amp;amp; delicious. I followed the recipe with 4 bananas &amp;amp;amp; 1\/2 tsp of cinnamon. It was definitely a hit &amp;amp;amp; my first time baking a banana bread. I'll definitely use this recipe again with walnuts next time.","Really good recipe. very moist. I added pecans to mine since I didn't have walnuts. Husband loved it, will make again.","I use 1\/2 cup sugar and 1\/2 cup brown sugar and add cinnamon sugar on top before baking. I make mini loaves and everyone loves them. I do half without walnuts and half with. Everyone loves it!","I made them with 4 bananas. While they were moist, they were a little heavy\/ dense. I think nuts are a must unless you're allergic. Very good and easy recipe! I'll definitely use it again! Made 6 large muffins.","My go-to recipe for banana bread. Make it frequently. Excellent! Thanks for sharing.","This is the first recipe I've ever seen that reminds you to &quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven.&quot; I've never gotten into the habit of storing pots and pans in my oven, I know lots of people who do. I think it's a very good way to begin a recipe that uses the oven and I hope other recipe-posters begin to make it the first item of ingredients, as opposed to item one of the instructions as most bakers first turn on their oven so it is preheating while assembling the ingredients.","So delicious!","I doubled &amp; it made three perfect sized loaves. This was a nice change from the overly dense loaves I've been making the past few years. Nice flavor, light &amp; not overly sweet but sweet enough. I did sprinkle some brown sugar as recommended by another reviewer &amp; we liked it.","I used to be a cookbook addict until I realized that I can't remember where the best recipes were in which of my hundreds of books. So now I just search on the web and see what looks interesting. Not only was this my first hit but the &quot;remove pots and pans from the oven&quot; totally struck me because that is where I keep all my cookie sheets! LOL Tasted perfect!!! So nice to have a banana bread without cinnamon.","I laughed so hard at the first instruction: remove odd pots and pans from oven! Surprised we weren't instructed to crack open the eggs and discard the shells ;-)","I added 1\/2 cup chopped walnuts. Delicious! Next time I use four bananas!","I love dark brown sugar, so did half white, half dark brown, and added teaspoon pumkin pie spice......","Yum!! Turned out great.. I don't like too sweet so I put 3\/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup sugar so the sweetness is perfect!!","Fantastic! I used 4 bananas. I had to keep it in the oven for an extra 10 minutes. Used a 9x5 loaf pan, sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Wonderfully moist &amp; very favorable. Definitely going in my favorites.","I have made this 4 different times and i always add 4 bananas which makes it better in my opinion and with 3 bananas with this 5th time we will see if its as good","Was really good. I added 4 bananas because some reviews said it'd be more moist. However all it did was make it doughy in the middle no matter how long I baked it. So I definitely think you should stick to original recipe for sure. Really good!",null,"Delicious! I used 4 smallish bananas and it is so moist! Also, I used The Neat Egg in the 2nd batch, an egg replacer that has the consistency of a lightly whisked egg when you mix it up, and it worked as well as the recipe did with eggs.","I didn't follow the recipe at all and added a bunch of superfluous ingredients. Thus I'm reviewing a recipe completely different from what is posted. Stop the madness! Reviews are meant to review the actual recipe not something lil Miss Betty crocker decides to makeup","Great and so easy. I added choc chip and walnuts. Awesome","Great recipe! I added 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and omitted the butter. I also added 1\/2 cup of pecans and 3\/4 cup of dark chocolate chips. Big hit for all members of my family, from young to old. Best eaten after day 2.??","I used this because of the first line in the diections, and liked the end result.","Have made this many times now - BEST BANANA BREAD! Better than cafes, better than maccas. Optional add a couple sprinkles of chocolate chips on top, but works perfectly on its own.","The names right Best Banana Bread i also liked her first line,caught my eye......Ill never use another..","Really good","I love this recipe... only one I will use! I add 4-5 bananas and chocolate chips! Super moist and amazing!","Followed the recipe to a T with 3 (large) bananas and then added a tablespoon of cinnamon and about a third of a cup of walnut pieces. My son LOVED it and it was super dense and moist. The only thing was it took a lot longer to cook, so it was pretty dark on the outside. That may just be my oven, but it was still delicious!","I've made thousands of banana bread loaves in my time with many different recipes but I have to agree that this one is the best. Moist and delicious, not dense and heavy like many recipes are. This will be my go to recipe from now on. Can't wait to try it with different additions, ie cranberries, pecans, etc.","I used margarine instead of butter and I used 1\/2 cup white sugar and 1\/2 cup brown sugar and I threw in a few chocolate chips after mixing and the result was delicious!","Post a pic soon... cooking now.","added a cup of semi-rehydrated cranberries and walnuts. turned out great","Used spelt flour and honey. Hope it taste as good as it looks.","Totally delicious,I stayed too the recipe, except someone put the vanilla away with almost nothing in the bottle. Mine was not as Brown as some pictures. Also the size of pan was not included in recipe","I added chunky chocolate chips to mine. It is beautifully brown and smells divine. I am giving it as a gift so I had to resist but it seems super moist. Now I have to make another one for myself.","Very good the first day, stored the leftovers in the frig overnight. This morning the flavors are even more pronounced and way yummy. Excellent recipe. I used 3-1\/2 bananas, added freshly pitted\/chopped dates, (about 1\/2 cup.) Had to bake a bit longer, (covered top with foil the last 10-15 minutes.) Next time I make this, my husband has requested the addition of coconut &amp; chopped pecans along with the dates. Bet it will be great that way too.","I used a 9inch square glass pan. I had also added 1\/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. Yummy!! Its smelled delicious and taser delicious too. ??","This is absolutely delicious. I love how simple it is too! I added 1\/2 C chocolate chips and put course sugar with a sprinkle of cinnamon on the top of the bread, but honestly it would be great without it. It's an awesome recipe.","It was very good. we didn't do vanilla because we had none but it was simply delish! the smell filled up the house into every single room..we made then into banana bread muffins instead of a loaf pan. hole family loved it, even the dog!","So I swapped out brown sugar for white... used 4 nannas and added a stick of cream cheese and folded in crasins. Off the Hook YUMMY! - Perfect!","This has become my go-to banana bread recipe. There doesn't seem to be a way to go wrong. I have made it exactly as written, with 3 or 4 bananas, and prefer it with 4. I have also added walnuts, chocolate chips, M&amp;Ms, etc. and they all taste great. Personal favorite is with walnuts, followed by the 'just the bananas' version. My final version of this has only two small changes. Since I use 4 bananas, I cut the sugar back to 2\/3 cup. And I use 1\/3 cup white sugar, and 1\/3 cup turbinado sugar. I like the flavor of turninado sugar, but all turbinado leads to a too dark loaf.","Loved it! I added 4 super ripe small bananas instead of 3. It's nice and moist and very simple.","Perfect Recipe! 4 Bananas makes it moist and delicious! Everyone loves this recipe and it's so easy!","Ok, so appreciated the humor interjected into the directions. &quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven&quot; truly funny! Kudos to the author. Thanks for making me chuckle as I was preparing to whip up a loaf of this delicious banana bread! So rare to have light hearted non political or nasty humor anymore....refreshing!","Best recipe I've ever tried! it's so moist, not dried out or over cooked at all. I added chopped walnuts and semi sweet chocolate chips and it is heavenly! I used a 9&quot;x9&quot; pan and it came out about an 1-1\/4&quot; thick (at the centre)","Currently making my second loaf in the past week! My family LOVES this banana bread and i found it quick and easy to make! I added some pecans to it and its great. I used 4 bananas and i will continue to do so, bread was light and moist. I enjoyed the laugh about removing the pots and pans at the beginning of the directions too ha i always forget that part! Thanks for a great recipe i will use again and again!","Awesome recipe!! Made it twice already..both times were made into muffins instead of loaf. First time I made this, I took it to work and within a few minutes they were gone. When I got home my husband and children complained that I didn't make enough..so I made them again today..the recipe yield 1 dozen.. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written ..I used 4 bananas. It was great..but like everyone else I tweaked the recipe and turned out even better (so my 11 y\/o food critique daughter said anyway ??)","Just wondering what type of flour is used in this recipe?","This is the best recipe for banana bread... moist, very sweet taste when made with ripened bananas...sprinkled brown sugar on top of loaf prior to baking! Used whole wheat flour! Delicious.","The name's right on point! It's the best banana bread I've ever had! I've always loved my recipe and have used it for many years until today. I couldn't find my recipe card so I looked on line and found this one. I'll never use another banana bread recipe! I made a double batch and used 8 bananas instead of 6. Personal preference..I like it to have extra bananas! Enjoy &amp; thanks for the recipe!","I don't have a bread pan, so baked it in an 8&quot; square, greased well with butter and instead of dusting with flour, I added sesame seeds. I baked 25 minutes at 350, turned a half and baked 25 more minutes. Delish.","I did everything right except I forgot to remove the odd pots and pans out of the oven beforehand. It was hard to get out and I burned myself on a meatloaf casserole I'd been baking since last Tuesday. Why does this always happen to me? The recipe was okay otherwise I guess. I might try it again next week while I'm doing the blood sausage.","I have made this bread for multiple people, and everyone loves it! I'll never use another recipe for banana bread again. This is by far the best! If you love banana bread, I highly recommend that you try this one! Thanks for sharing this recipe!","Great recipe, love it","Came out amazing. Don't use bananas that are too overripe or they will lose the banana flavor. I've made a recipe using 6-7 too-overripe-almost-black bananas and it was less banana-y than this recipe using 4 brown bananas. I changed a lot but it came out great. I used 1.5 cups + 3 tbs of sifted cake flour added 1\/2 tsp of baking powder 1 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp cinnamon 1\/2 tsp all spice 1\/2 tbsp vanilla extract 1\/2 c. packed brown sugar + 1\/4 cup white sugar Mixed the wet stuff just to combine gently with a whisk Mixed in the dry ingredients until just combined Sprayed standard loaf size (9x5?) pan with cooking spray and baked first for 40min to check, then an extra 15-20min for a total of about 60min, covered it with foil the last 10min It came out very well. If you let it sit at night (covered with foil), the texture is drier. I would recommend adding walnuts or cranberries or something, but I liked it as-is","Really nice, added sultanas ??","I added raisins, and it turned delicious. My family love it!","My go to recipe EVERY single time! I have made this countless times using this recipe and it is perfect every time.","Thank you for reminding me to take the pans out of the oven. This quickly ranked this as one of the best recipes ever! Thank you","Great Recipe, super forgiving.. I over cooked it a tiny bit, but it still remained moist, fluffy and flavorful. I will definitely keep this in mind when I have ripe Bananas. Walnuts definitely elevate this recipe and add a need crunch! Enjoy it sooner!!! use a muffin pan, cut the cooking time in half. 13 to 16 min","Not sure anyone that reviewed this knows what good banana bread is. I followed the recipe to a T (other than using 4 bananas instead of 3) and I hate it. It's dense and has a strong floury taste, not enough banana taste. The floury taste is what turned me off. I LOVE banana bread and have used many different recipes and usually get many compliments. I'm steering clear of this one again.","Could you possibly frost banana bread and if so what kind of frosting? Cream Cheese? Oh and also i doubled the recipe and baked them in two round cake pans.Nevermind we tasted the Banana (cake) Bread and it was\/is fantastic!! So moist. Thank you for that recipe.","I'm only young, these recipes need to be more specific. When It says flour the pan, I have been baking for years and never came across &quot;flour the pan.&quot;","I have made it twice and each time everybody was impressed!","Another winner again! I added about 3 heaping tablespoons of sour cream to the banana mix. I was told that this was the best banana loaf I've made, ever. This one's a keeper.","I haven't tasted it yet, but is sure looks good! Oh, and I added chocolate chips. ??","I substituted half a cup of flour for half a cup of oats. It worked well!","Added nutmeg cinnamon and carmel chips.....currently baking in a bundt pan.....I cant wait to try it!!??","Always always comes out perfect!! My family can't get enough. I have to make 2 loafs. I always use frozen (defrosted ahead of time of course) bananas. :)","Made it and it turned out perfect ! Moist and delicious ..I am not a fan of bananas but I Absolutely love this! This recipe is a keeper !","Best banana bread I've ever made. I thought my Grandmother's? was the best but this tops it. I did add walnuts only because I didn't have any pecans. Follow the recipe and use 4 bananas if you have them. Sounds like a lot but was PERFECT!","This recipe is great - my only issue is that the finished product is very sweet. I'll cut the sugar in half next time. I made this with bread flour and only had two bananas on hand and it still turned out perfectly. Would taste great with walnuts.","I have made this recipe as is multiple times, sometimes I add stuff too. My favorite variation so far has been the addition of diced mango and bit of ground ginger, yum!","I dont like banana bread, never have but I found this recipe to make bread for my husband when I had too many bananas at the end of their ripe period. I have to tell you... I love this bread. I have made it 3 times in 2 weeks!","It turned out so moist and so yummy!! One of the best recipes I have tried.","This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever made! I did tweak a little based on some reviews and on personal experience, and the result was fantastic! I didn't have any butter on hand so I substituted for the same amount of canola oil. I used half brown sugar, half organic white sugar. I used four very ripe bananas, and added a dash of cinnamon. The result is very moist and delicious banana bread. It baked for about 45 minutes instead of the 55 minutes required on the recipe as I saw that the bread was already browning quite a bit. Highly recommend this recipe. Will definitely make again!","I made this recipe with a muffin tray instead for 18 minutes. A dark gray muffin tray. So adjust your times accordingly cuts different color pans need different times.","delicious! so easy to make and so yummy!","That is an easy to follow banana bread recipe even for novice bakers. It came out nice and moist and thank you for reminding don't overmix when adding dry ingredients","I made this for the first time, took it camping with my grandsons. They both loved it! I am making it again for them this week.","*I tried this recipe with some very ripe bananas that I didn't want to throw away. If there's any brown spots on the bananas then my kids refuse to eat them so my hubby asked if I knew how to make banana bread. I of course said yes without knowing what recipe to use. Ha ha! Anyway, hopped onto Google and did some research and came across this recipe. All I had to buy was baking soda to get going and when the bread was done, it tasted delicious! The bread was golden, soft and very moist! This recipe is definitely a keeper. You won't be disappointed. Easy to make within 10 minutes.! It took me about 50 minutes to bake my banana bread. :) Happy Baking. *I added Walnuts to my first loaf, then chocolate chips to my 2nd loaf! Both turned out great. :)","my friend made it and i usely don't like banana bread but when i tried it i loved it .","Have made this several times to rave reviews. I do use the vanilla and also add a 1\/2 cup of chopped nuts for texture. However, it's essential to test for doneness. Perhaps it's my oven, but the 55-minute suggested baking time is just not enough. I usually add 20 or even 30 minutes to get a knife to come out clean from the center.","Very good but just extended the baking time :)","Followed all directions, made many breads, this was horrible. 10 mins into baking it was overflowing and burning bottom of oven. Tossed it all out, outside too dark, inside liquidy.","Really good recipe! I would recommend putting four bananas (like it says), tastes amazing. However, 55 minutes doesn't work, and it will have to be baked longer. All I added were some chopped almonds, yum!","Awsome and simple! I have started adding 3 eggs and 4 bananas...and while it's baking i put a small bowl of water in the oven....I like my BB moist. -cheers","This recipe is perfect. I did the 4 bananas (2 freshly dead and 2 frozen). I did not add an extra egg. I did swirl in some cinnamon, coz I love it. One thing about the cooking time... I used a 9&quot; loaf pan... maybe some are using an 8&quot; and that's why it's coming out a little underdone. Just a thought.","Can I used baking powder instead of baking soda? Cause that's the only available on my kitchen. How is the measurement? Thanks in advance!","I made this a few weeks ago and it was delicious. I made it again today and added some vanilla and cinnamon, and cup of chocolate chips. I made two loaves and I'm scared they may not make it to tomorrow. Here's to hoping. ??","Amazing recipe and came out perfect! i used the remaining batter to make some muffins and those were also delicious !","Best banana bread ever! I use 4 bananas for the extra moistness! Easy, quick, and soooo delicious.","This was a hit.... with a few tweaks. I split up the sugar 50\/50 with white sugar and golden brown sugar (also, made it less sweet, which is good). Also, I used margarine instead of butter because historically for me, margarine keeps things moist. I also added a streusel topping (white sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon, water) and that created a good crunch on top. I also used 4 bananas. I think next time, I will add some cinnamon to give it a little more flavor. With my family of 4, we devoured the whole loaf in 1 day!","I didn't make it yet was just comparing different recipes to mine but had to laugh when it said remove odd pots and pans from oven...how did you know? LOL","The kids helped (ages 5&amp;6). The banana bread turned out so light and fluffy! I had 4 bananas to use. So amazing. I made a small loaf with m&amp;ms in it. so glad I made this. I made this with gluten free flour and it turned out perfect.","This is my go-to recipe. I do add walnuts, tho (my preference).","So easy and so freakin good. Now made it twice, followed the recipe (added 4 very ripe bananas, about 1tsp of cinnamon, and 1 cup of walnuts). First time I made with 4 reg. ripe bananas. Second time I made it with 2 reg. ripe and 2 frozen ripe bananas (both turned out just as good). Also, let mine bake for 1 hour, then turned off oven and let it sit for an additional 5 minutes. They came out amazing!","It truly is the best recipe out there. I followed it to the t (used 4 bananas) . It came out so moist and delicious I might end up eating the whole loaf!","I have tried so many banana bread recipes, but this one is seriously the best..","Good recipe. This was my first time making banana bread, and it was a success! The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sweetness. I took the tweaks into consideration and only used half a cup of sugar and it was still very sweet, not too sweet for me. However, I can't even imagine how sweet it would be with a whole cup of sugar. I might even use a quarter cup of sugar next time. Using 4 bananas is a MUST in order to achieve that moist, fluffy interior with a crusty outside. I only had two fresh ripe bananas, but I always save my ripe bananas in the freezer so I took two frozen bananas out and thawed them in a bag on the counter until they were completely thawed. Don't be frightened by the texture of the defrosted bananas; they are mushy and liquid-y (maybe a little brown, too). I mashed them in with the fresh ripe bananas and my bread still turned out great! Also, I added a few shakes of cinnamon and chocolate chips because, what is banana bread without chocolate chips???","Very very moist.....I did add in Walnuts and chocolate chips....had to cook 5 more minutes!","This is the best banana bread I have had ..I use coconut oil instead of the butter..makes a nicer denser loaf and refrigerates REALLY well. I cut down the sugar a bit or use honey.","I use the recipe all the timer I double it to make two loaves using 9 bananas and I put one cup of blueberries in each loaf l bake at 330 degree for about 70minutes or so GREAT Great","I substituted sugar with 12 packets of stevia as I cannot have sugar and used 4 bananas. I also used whole wheat flour. I baked it for a little less than 55 minutes and next time will only bake for 50 minutes. It was a little overdone. But tasty.","I've tried several different banana bread recipes. By far this is the best one yet! I add 4 bananas and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Also, instead of flouring the loaf pan, I use oil &amp; powdered sugar!! Everybody loves my tweaked version of this bread. It is so moist and delicious!!!","What size should loaf pan be?","This is my second time making this bread. The first time I followed the recipe the second time I added walnuts and it turned out even better. I always tell my family to leave me three bananas so I can make this bread and I just overall love it.","I used only half cup of sugar for 4 bananas. With my past experience banana bakery's really turn out very sweet, so I reduced the amount of sugar and the taste is perfect for me. The sweetness doesn't hit the nerves. Also, I kept it for 50 minutes but still the top burnt a bit. I kept it at 178 deg C ( approx 350 deg F) hence I feel the temperature should be around 175 deg C. And yes, I added walnuts too! It tastes good :)","I seem to have found the one thing that will ruin this recipe: whole wheat flour. The bread turned out moist with a great texture; it just doesn't taste like anything, even though I used 4 bananas (3 thawed very ripe and 1 starting to age)","I feel a bit bad because I used this recipe as a bit of an experiment. But I had bananas hanging around that needed using, so I figured, what the heck. I've been trying to make things healthier, so the first thing I did is use oil instead of butter. The same amount. After measuring my oil I always put the measuring cup upside down in the tin, let the excess drip off and use that to grease my baking tin with. I didn't use sugar. Instead I used a stevia and brown sugar baking blend I'd picked up, and used half a cup. Its twice as strong as sugar though, so I didn't reduce the sweetness and for my taste it was perfect, though I can see why some might say its too sweet. I also didn't use eggs, I didn't have any in the house. But on my last healthy food shopping binge I brought ground flaxseed, and used that instead. I also threw in some raisins that I'd soaked in a little bit of bourbon, mostly because I knew my boyfriend would be tasting it and he'd appreciate the booze. I found I liked it too! It wasn't boozy tasting, just delicious. The finished loaf was delicious, though I did have issues with it being squidgy in the middle. However with my changes I can't be sure that its the recipe's fault really. It doesn't taste raw though, more just gooey like a brownie, for example. And it feels naughty even though I think its fairly healthy! Apologies to the author though, for taking such liberties with their recipe, though thank you for giving me another regular bake! :)","This recipe is great!","wow... the bread came out so delicious and yummy. I would just replace regular sugar with brown sugar and add some pecans and raisins and few other dry fruits.Ultimate heaven!","Amazing! I added 1\/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 ground all spice seed, and some chopped pecans. Delicious","This bread is sensational. It is very good. We added the extra banana even better. By far the best.",null,"Made an account just to leave a review. Love this recipe! I never bake but wanted to find a good banana bread recipe for some old bananas I had lying around. I've made this recipe 3-4 times in the last few weeks and everyone loves it. Have been using 3 bananas and it's great. Easy recipe to follow, have been making it with a 4 year old.","This is my first time baking banana bread. It came out looking good and delicious. I used a quarter of the original amount of sugar, I added half a cup of raisins and I added twice the amount of vanilla extract. I use whole wheat flour instead of white\/bleached, so the baking time took longer - a little over an hour.","Delicious and easy. In addition to bananas I add other fruits that are over ripe. Great with peaches or strawberries. You may need to add a touch more of the dry ingredients unless you want super most bread in that case.","This was the first banana bread i have ever made that wasn't from a mix. It turned out perfect!!! Now I don't mind buying bananas ! Instead of throwing out over ripe ones which I always end of doing, I can make this simple and easy recipe! I'm gonna add some nuts next time!","Very moist. I used 4 bananas and added 3\/4 cup chopped walnuts and made the bread exactly as recipe stated. Moist and delicious. Definitely will make this again.","I used 4 bananas, forgot to add in the vanilla but still got a perfect bread.","I added two finely chopped serrano peppers and 3\/4 cup walnuts. I also used four small bananas instead of three. It turned out great!","Really good banana bread! The only thing I did different from the recipe was add chocolate chips. Holy cow! Dessert bread! Maybe next time I'll make it without the chips.....maybe.","This is truly the best banana bread recipe I've found! All my friends keep begging for it. Recommend 4 bananas for the extra moisture, and adding chocolate chips tastes excellent too.","I would use baking powder not soda and add in shredded coconut, and yes my kids love the chocolate chips.","Delicious! Added walnuts. Yum!","Easy and very good. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and dusted the top with brown sugar before baking. I couldn't find my loaf pan, so I used a bunt pan instead. It made the edges crisp and the middle moist.my brother and his family, and my daughter and her family all loved it. Worth making again.","I forgot to follow the first thing in the directions and nearly burned down the house.....LOL...love it. I really liked the texture. I have always only used one egg in the recipe I used before.","This recipe is awesome! I have now made it countless times. I usually like to add dark chocolate chips. I have also made it with walnuts, or both walnuts and chocolate chips, and it's still delicious. Only issue for me is it takes way longer to bake in my oven. I usually need to tack on an extra 10 minutes or so.","batter tastes AMAZING still baking but i'm sure it will turn out just perfect!","My husband loved my banana bread. I used the directions but kinda improvised it coz i have more bananas called for more added ingredients. I also added crushed peanuts and cream cheese to it. It turned out really really good!","Man, my hUsBaNd just gobbled this up and said YUM YUM!!!! Instead of bananas I used watermelon, and I traded the sugar for salt. I also put some Skittles in there, and some cayenne pepper. I did adjust the cooking time to 3 hours, cuz we were sleeping. Then I put a dallop of sour cream and a giant piece of parsley on top....so fancy! Will def make this for my hUsBand again!!!!","I have this going in the oven right now, and it smells divine. The batter was to D-I-E for, I can't wait to see how this tastes. Thank you for an amazing recipe!","This was an easy banana bread. I chose to use 4 bananas. My fiance and I both agree that this made it too moist for our liking. The bread fell apart. I also added chocolate chips. Looking forward to trying this recipe with 3 bananas and maybe with some cinnamon as another reviewer said. This recipe fit perfectly into my loaf pan, it did not overflow. It took me an extra 15 minutes (probably due to extra moistness with the 4th banana) to cook versus the time listed. I cooked it on on the middle shelf of my gas oven.","My husband and son can't get enough of this bread. Usually I double the recipe and make banana bread french toast out of one loaf. It's delicious and doesn't need any extra syrup or powdered sugar!","Great recipe. Very easy. I added chocolate chips and the kids devoured it in 1\/2 a day!","My Fiance and I LOVE this recipe! I add a handful of Blueberries and the combination was delicious.","Best banana bread ever!! I make this all the time. I barely get any because my kids &amp; husband eat it all before I get a chance. My neighbors ask me often if I'll make them a loaf. I do add 4 bananas and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Sometimes I add half a package of chocolate chips!! YUMMY! Adding the extra vanilla &amp; banana makes it taste amazing!! Give it a try, I bet you'll taste the difference &amp; LOVE IT!!","Superb! Only had one banana, so used 1\/2 cup container of strawberry applesauce to complete 1 cup of bananas. OMG! Best banana bread ever. Did take approx 1 hrs, 15 min, a little brown on outside, but ummm, mmm, good! Toothpick too short to check doneness, suggest a skewer.","Best banana bread I ever had. I use a 10&quot; x 7&quot; baking pan (from Old Time Pottery) and it takes 34 minutes to bake.","The name of this banana bread is 100% accurate! I made a gluten free version. I used the Pillsbury gluten free flour. Same measurements. I did use 4 bananas. Awesome! Love it!! I can't say enough about it!","Yummy is the word. Super easy and turns out so well. Takes at least an hour in my over but worth the wait! I only use 2 1\/2 bananas but add 1\/2 tsp of cinnamon.","We love this recipe!! super easy and delicious. We used brown sugar and we add some chocolate chips and extra vanilla and it turned out really nice!!!","Super delicious but it's a tad bit too oily and sugary. I'm not sure how to remedy this, any suggestions? I really would like a healthy banana bread recipe. :) So good though if you don't mind the extra cals!!!","This is a wonderful recipe. I swapped out the butter for coconut oil. No, you cannot taste the coconut oil. I prefer using 4 bananas. Organic bananas have more flavor in my opinion, so I like to use those. After I pour into my bread pan, that I coat with coconut oil, I top the batter with diced pecans. This is a HUGE hit in my house.","I substituted the butter for cocunut oil like others suggested. Replaced the 1 cup sugar with 3\/4 raw honey. I replaced 1.5 cup flour with 1 cup spelt flour and 1\/2 cup unbleached flour. I used 4 bananas. Sprinkled peices of walnut on top with alittle sprinkle of dark brown sugar. After it was cooked, I put a few spats of butter on top ridge and I Covered with foil and a towel on a cooling rack to keep moisture in. After cooled to warm buttered and enjoyed the best bandana bread I've had in a very long time...","My oven doesn't go up to 350 only 250 do I cook it longer?","Have tried many banana bread recipes. This is one of the best. I add walnuts sometimes.","Love this recipe I always add zucchini to it and chocolate chips and it's the best.","This has been my go to recipe for years. Very moist and flavorful. I do line my pans with parchment paper though.","Hi, What kind of flour do you use brand etc.... and how about dark brown sugar and not white?","This is definitely one of the best banana breads I've ever made! I added some cinnamon and sprinkled the top with sugar and it came out perfect! I also only used 2 large bananas but it was still super moist.","Excellent recipe. I used 4 bananas, the vanilla extract, and added 1\/2 tsp almond extract and brown sugar sprinkled on top for a little extra flavor. 350&deg; for 60 min. Came out amazing.","Go w\/ 4 bananas, but then less sugar (1\/2 - 3\/4 cup rather than 1 cup).","Whenever I baked banana bread in the past, it never turned out right. The middle was always undercooked. This time, using this recipe, it turned out perfect. I've literally dreamt of this day. I subbed the flour for quinoa flour and I couldn't even tell. It was so fluffy. I wish I used the full cup of sugar because it could've been a little sweeter.","WAY too sweet. Almost inedible. If you're using overly ripe bananas, I suggest halving the sugar in this recipe.","Tastes great but over cooked a few minutes. Made a double batch of two loaves since we had 7 ripe bananas. Recipe is great as advertised. Only issue was both loaves were still wet\/too moist in center at 55 minutes. I kept in the oven an extra 7 minutes and that was probably too much with the outside starting to get too brown and the inside was no longer wet. If still too wet\/moist with wood skewer then only add a few minutes to complete baking.","This is a decent BASE recipe.","Good base recipe. I followed some of the suggested tweaks \u2013 halved the amount of sugar, used four very ripe bananas, and added cinnamon. I took the loaf out at the suggested time and it was cooked through. My only complaint is that the bottom of my loaf is a little oily \u2013 maybe next time I'll use just under half a cup of butter.","Love this recipe. Added little more vanilla and topped with walnuts before baking. It is a sweet banana bread. Have baked this for family, friends and clients- never a complaint!","Fantastic base recipe. I used to work at a bakery- they now sell this recipe. I'm a health nut and couldn't resist giving it a healthy tweak. I used organic ingredients, I altered: 5 small browning bananas, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1\/2 tsp almond extract, 6 tbs butter\/2 tbs coconut oil, 1\/2c cane sugar\/ 1\/2 c coconut palm sugar, Himalayan salt, cinnamon, walnuts, chocolate chips. Bomb digggiiittttyy!","New house so I didn't have vanilla, but still tasted great! I used 3 large over ripe bananas and added cinnamon and allspice to give it a more spiced taste. Was delicious! Will continue to use this recipe :)","Tasted great. But even though it was on the middle rack, the top started burning, while the inside was still raw. Next time ill make sure to move it, but maybe an extra note on this would be useful.","Used 4 bananas, cinnamon and mini chocolate chips! Yummy","This was the best banana bread I have ever made. Moist, but no gooey, I can't wait to make more.","Hands down the best banana bread recipe ever. Where has this been my whole life?","wow! BEST banana bread? i can trust this!","I made this, it was a hit! I added finely chopped walnuts and sprinkled top with Crystallized natural sugar","This is good recipe i also add well drained crushed pineapple, ane either coconut or coconut flavoring i call it tropical bread very moist and good bread.","Really delicious! This is a keeper. I have tried many banana bread recipes, trying to find one that was over the top. This one was soft, moist, and full of flavor. I did tweak it and add 1\/2 c. greek yogurt and doubled the vanilla.","Really good banana bread! My kids loved it!","I followed the directions to the T. Oven timer went off and the middle is still not quite cooked. Should I leave it in for another 10 min? will I burn it?","LOVE! Absolutely delicious!","Wow! My search for a perfect banana bread recipe if OVER! This is so incredibly moist and with the perfect flavor. Used three med, and half a large banana (it was at that perfect stage of ripeness, so I had to eat half). Needed just a few extra minutes in my small electric oven. No one else in my family likes nuts in their bread, but next time will use some walnuts and as another reviewer suggested, will try with coconut oil instead of butter. Also want to experiment with chocolate chips. Definitely a keeper","Wow! You must have access in my kitchen. Pots and pan storage in the oven! This is one of the best banana breads I have made. So moist and deliciously flavorful. Shared it with family and Senior social group. Will make again with walnuts! Yum??","Wonderful! I just reduced the amount of sugar and salt (used brown sugar instead of white) and added chopped almonds, cashews and walnuts (obsessed with nuts). Totally amazing. :)","Very good! The best I've made so far. I added one extra egg yoke and a cup of chocolate covered raisins. They were a big hit.","Awesome, awesome, awesome! I just added cinnamon, nutmeg and pecans. I used 4 bananas. Moist, delicious with the right crunch added from the nuts. Yum!","It is delicious!!!! I swirled a little bit of brown sugar on the top before baking and it's so good!","Overall, very tasty! I halved the recipe because I only had 2 bananas and I also turned them into mini-muffins! I followed the directions for everything except turning it into a loaf. I cooked them at 350 for about 13 minutes. They were super tasty fresh out of the oven. My half a recipe made 10 mini muffins. The only drawback was the greasing and flouring the tin because some of the flour made the outside of the muffin taste odd. They're pretty good, though, thanks for the recipe!","My three year old has celiacs and an esophagus disorder which results in a very limited diet. We are top 6 allergy free (no wheat, eggs, dairy, soy, nuts or seafood) so I am always substituting ingredients. For the banana bread I used earth balance &quot;butter&quot;, bobs red mill gluten free baking flour and egg replacer and it turned out fabulous. My daughter requests it all the time and she hugged me and said it is the best food I make her! Thanks for making this momma's heart happy! My husband and I also love it. Had it at a party and it was a hit. No one knew it was allergy friendly!!!","Can I use 4 frozen bananas?","Quick and easy recipe turned out great! Baking fun with my 3 year old. We used 3 bananas, a little applesauce, and a dash of cinnamon. We used a bundt pan instead of a loaf pan, it was done in 39 minutes.","Excellent! I keep tasting it because I can't believe how good it is.","Best ever don't need another BANANA BREAD recepie this is by far most Excellent","I've just finished. I did everything according to the recipe above and it came out raw in the inside while dark brown on the outside. 350F, right? Another thing - it's way too sweet!! I'd have put only half cup of sugar if I knew it.","Added little cinnamon and brown sugar few spoonful , I would reduce sugar if banana are very ripe like mine, they are sweet already . Added extra butter half stick that made loaf very moist and crust little different. Test really good ...","O.M.G. I have been using the same banana bread recipe for years. One day my daughter came home and said she likes my Mother's banana bread better than mine, so I thought it was time to change it up. This recipe is to die for! And my daughter now likes my bread better!","This is the BEST banana bread recipe ever!!!!! My family loves it.After I make it give it a half of a day and it would be gone.Love this recipe!!!!!!!","Turned out perfect and the fragrance fills our house. Made this recipe 3 times already and it disappears so fast that we're gonna keep it to ourselves tonight! Only thing changed was adding a half teaspoon of cinnamon and some brown sugar on top. Yum!","Turned out delicious n spongy...I added golden raisins and so used less sugar. For a crumbly topping i minced peanuts with brown sugar.","Love this banana bread! It was SO easy to make. I used the 'moister method' and used 4 bananas and also added a 1\/2 cup of chopped walnuts. SO GOOD!! The ONLY problem was that the recipe says 55 minutes and the 'page' said 1 hour and 5 minutes. I split the difference and baked it for 60 minutes. I should have just went for 55 minutes. The bottom was a bit overdone, but that certainly didn't affect the flavor!! I will make this again.... soon!!!!","I made this one and it turned out to be a huge hit. I am a beginner in baking and not many recipes had become successful..but this one was perfect.Loved it!! Thank you so much..","I used 4 bananas and it was so moist and delicious! Definitely the best","Felt like a pro! Great recipe! I tripled the baking powder for baking soda (I didn\u2019t have soda) -turned out amazing!","Definitely the best and the easiest of banana bread recipe! Replaced white sugar with brown. Looooove it!!","Really easy, my first time making banana bread and it turned out great! I read some of the suggested changes and used peanut butter instead of butter and 3\/4 cup sugar.","Husband loved it !! Everybody at work loved it!! Absolutely delicious!!","Baked this Banana Bread today and it turned out really good! Very easy to make, you don't even need a blender or a mixer. It is absolutely delicious.","Sooo moist and dense yet light and soft at the same time. Definitely add the fourth banana, when I made it I actually added 5 very very ripe bananas. Top it off with some fresh chopped walnuts and sprinkle brown sugar before putting it in the oven it's literally the best finish. (also bakes totally great in a 7x11 pan if you don't have a loaf pan)","I used 4 bananas and added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Baked for 39 minute in a bundt pan. Delicious!","I made this for a bake sale, and it was a hit! I added doubled the recipe and added a cup of unsweetened coconut, and a cup of dark chocolate chips, delicious!","A great recipe which is easy, fast with cheap ingredients. Everyone loved it! I've made it in the metal loaf tin, foil moulds, and cupcakes forms. Metal loaf tin: exactly like the recipe says - 175'C 55 mins. Foil mould: 165'C 40 mins. Cupcakes: 165'C 20 mins. I use 4 medium bananas and 3\/4 cup of sugar. My favourite cake to make thus far, since I started baking 3 months ago :) no mixer required :))","I used 4 bananas, which made for a rich bread. Butter was unsalted, so 1 t of butter would have been better. Grinded sea salt over the top while cooling. Delicious!","I doubled the recipe, and used walnuts which i crushed in a zip lock bag. It was so delish!","I had planned on putting walnuts in my batter, but got distracted talking to my mother-in-law, right after I put it in the oven. So I quickly thought, ummm I put 1 Tbsp &amp; 1\/2 in small dish, 2 Tbsps Brown sugar and about 1\/2 C chopped walnuts. Mixed together &amp; put in microwave 40 secs. After the banana bread had baked about 30 mins, spooned the nuts over the top of the bread. Yummmy!","Im trying to add more fiber to my kids diet, so I put oats into the blender to use instead of flour, and I used applesauce instead of butter and doubled the recipe. Then took brown sugar, and cinnamon, oats, molasses and blended it up and sprinkled on top. Currently in the oven and smells great and is baking wonderfully.","Absolutely delicious. I used 4 bananas that I had in the freezer (makes the best banana bread). Used 1\/2 cup of Brown Sugar. And squirted about 2-3 TBS of pancake syrup. I didn't have walnuts so I crushed up a 1\/2 cup of almonds. After I poured the batter in the loaf pan. I sprinkled with brown sugar and almonds. It's amazing!!!!!","Love Love Love this recipe! I've made it twice in the past 2 weeks, and it gets better each time.","I put rasains in mine, instead of nuts. I soak the rasains overnight in rum. But, no worries if you don't want alcohol, it evaporates off during cooking. Or could use rum extract. Gives it a nice kick, bit moist though, if you like it that way.","Combined 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1\/2 cup all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium-large bowl. Melted the butter in a separate bowl in the microwave, then added the cup of sugar, stirred, then microwaved another 10 seconds to dissolve the sugar a bit more. Separately, beat the two eggs in a bowl with a whisk, then added the four mashed bananas to the eggs, then added the butter\/sugar and the vanilla. After that was all mixed up, I poured the mixture into the flour bowl and stirred until combined. Baked in a bundt pan. Delicious. Next time, will add some stuff - coconut, walnuts, pineapple, maybe? Thanks for the recipe!","Also added dark chocolate chips, first batch was great, this batch is going to have creamcheese frosting!!!!","I'll have to try this with poppy seeds!","This is THE banana bread recipe! Buttery, moist and delicious.","Super good. The best. I would use 4 banana's. It does make a difference. Don't mix the banana's too much. Slightly lumpy is better. I have added blueberry's (so only 3 banana's), walnuts and chocolate chips. This isn't too sweet either. This recipe is a find!!","I used frozen bananas for this - thawed four for about 30 minutes, then mashed them to paste with the mixer. Removed and cleaned the bowl and followed the recipe as written. Worked a treat - the flavor is great, but you'll need amendments if you like more texture. Next time I'll test with dried\/reconstituted fruit and chopped nuts.","Easy to follow instructions. I added 2 tbsp. Of cinnamon apple sauce. Yummy!","I substituted with king Authurs gluten free flour and added hemp hearts and chia seeds to mixture. Perfect recipe! My entire family LOVED it.","I love your intro to the baking directions!!!! I'm baking your recipe today! Can't wait!","LOVE this recipe, I make it all the time! I add a cup of mini chocolate chips though, and it's incredible!","first time i bake! and it is great so moist and not too sweet .. it is perfect! highly recommend! I also added walnuts! yum!","Amazing, I had to replace butter with oil, and I added a teaspoon of Cinnamon, it turned out so moist and light and delicious!","My personal touch is I add some nutmeg, cinnamon, and fresh blueberries. I do not measure. It is solely on the individual's taste and liking.","FINALLY!!!! An amazing recipe!!! Turned out so well for my family!!! Will be doing this again next week. Didnt last very long ??","Used some cinnamon and a drop of nutmeg essential oil as well as chocolate chips. It's in the oven right now, I'll let you know how it turns out.","I haven't got a chance to try the bread itself yet, but the batter tasted AMAZING!!! It is in the oven as I type, and I am sure this will be a hit with the family...","First time I baked banana bread and it turned out perfectly! I used only 1\/2 cup of sugar and 4 bananas. Super moist, just the right amount of sweetness for me.

Used 4 bananas, delectable!","I just moved into my house 3 days ago and my next door neighbor brought me a homemade","This is basically the BEST banana bread I've ever made, and I've made a few. LOVED it. For some reason it took atleast 12 minutes longer cooking time in my convection oven (?) I added raw oats, pumpkin seeds and flax to the top, and we're trying to not gobble the whole thing up in an hour. Very moist without being wet or greasy. Thanks for this!!","Still in the oven can't wait to have some!","Can you mix it with honey? Or does it have to be sugar?","I don't know how to bake a lot of stuff but this was so easy and it turned out great.","Delicious. Moist. I cooked mine in a convection oven though.","Delicious! Used 4 bananas and slightly more than 1\/2 c chopped walnuts. Sprinkle a little brown sugar on top before baking. This is my new go-to recipe for banana bread!","Hi folks! I also worked at Chi Chi\u2019s loooong ago and I would really like to know how to make the green sauce we used on the chimichangas! Can you help!?","Hands down, best banana bread EVER!!!! Thanks so much for sharing, and I simply LOVED the baking directions.&quot;Remove old pots and pans before starting oven&quot; Sadly, some people don't know to do that before pre heating the oven. Ummm, I actually didn't remove the pans, but I was very young. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.","By far the best banana bread recipe ever! It lasted less than a day in my house. The only thing I did different was add chopped walnuts.","Excellent, excellent! I used four bananas. Next time I plan to use 50\/50 white and whole wheat flour and will add walnuts and brown sugar on the top. I just like to try and review the original recipe. I'll be making this often. Seems we can never eat bananas fast enough. Now I may not eat them on purpose just to let them sit around and get really ripe so I can make this.","Excellent recipe, used 4 bananas and it turned out moist and lovely. Followed someone's recommendation on here and sprinkled brown sugar over the top of it before baking it, I think that added a nice touch to the flavor.","I always forget to take out my new pot from the oven. It made me laugh and say thank u to who ever put this in the instructions. Best bread ever.","Love it but one loaf isn't enough lol, would it be fine to double this recipe","Came out PERFECTLY!!! Must make again! Don't forget the walnuts!","Seriously, I've made so many banana breads and this one... AWESOME!!!! Simple, Moist, Easy!!! I'm actually in shock.","Mine turned out dense and a little too moist in the middle but was DELICIOUS! By the next day it seemed to have settled a bit. I cut it in thick slices and then halved those in order to prevent it from crumbling when cutting. I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews, and added some walnuts and sugar to the top before I baked it and that made the top lovely and crunchy and chewy.","I have made this twice, and it is the best. My husband asked me to make it again, which gives it a thumbs up. Easier than most!","I have made so many different banana bread recipes over the years, and almost didn't try this because it was so simple, but it is the best by far! Cannot stop eating it!!","Keep to your Ingredient's, I just added a Hand full of Blue Berries at the end and hand folded in. It added some additional moisture, but the taste fantastic. Thanks for such a simple easy to make. Wishing you all , Very Merry Safe Holidays.","My family loves this bread. I added pieces of walnuts to it. Delicious! This recipe doesn\u2019t take long to combine. Baking takes an hour, but we\u2019ll worth the wait!","Yup, agreed, great recipe. It is simple and results in a wonderfully moist quick bread. As others did, I sprinkled it with some brown sugar before popping it in the oven which gave it a sweet crispy top. I have a convection oven and at 350 degrees it only took 45 minutes to bake.","I love this recipe, although I am gluten and MSG free now (Aka: &quot;Cardboard diet&quot;). I still make it for my family as often as possible. Thank you for sharing! :) Oh-- I often make muffins with the the batter as well. I just took some out of the oven... :) Delish!!","This banana bread is delicious! I substitute coconut oil for the butter as I usually do. Best ever. Cranberry orange bread on this site is exceptional and easy.","My daughter bought me some Einkorn flour and suggested I experiment with it. The flour is high in fiber and it's gluten content is weaker and much easier on our digestion, but some recipes need tweaking. This one didn't. It's moist, rich &amp; delish! Enjoy the benefits and the flavor!","I haven't tried it yet, but I certainly will. Anyone who starts a recipe with the words &quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven.&quot; is a baker after my own heart. Alternatively, when were you in my kitchen???","No variation, except using organic cane sugar and organic butter. Delicious!","A very good and easy recepie.","Excellent! Added chopped walnuts.","I used very small bread pans and made like 12. Half the cooking time and same amazing taste!","Excellent banana bread! Must include the fourth banana to give it that deep rich banana flavor. I realize oven times\/temperature may vary. However, I had to bake the bread for 25 to 30 additional minutes with four bananas before the toothpick came out clean for doneness. I covered the top with aluminum foil so it wouldn't burn or get too dark.","Easy to make. Very good. Got lots of compliments!","I tweaked mine with dark chocolate chunks and equal parts white and light brown sugar. It is so so so good!!","I always add an extra banana and sprinkle sugar over the bread prior to baking. This will give the finish bread a light caramelized\/ crunchy top coat.","I tried this and added 5 bananas as opposed to 3 or 4. The bread turned out absolutely delicious and super gooey. Definitely will use this recipe again in the future.","Most awesome banana bread ever!!","This was as good as everyone said. I'm really not a huge fan of banana bread but because I have a bad habit of buying bananas and letting them sit, I decided to try this. I tossed in some fresh blueberries and chopped walnuts and made muffins. Delish!! And warmed up with a cup of coffee? Double delish!!","I only had 2 bananas so I used about a cup of pumpkin puree and also toasted some pecans and rough chopped them and it was really moist and tasty.","This was a very easy to follow recipe that assures outstanding results. I added 1c. Cranberries-(dried) and 1c. Chopped walnuts for a more holiday look and taste. Also baked in an 8x8&quot; cake pan, and served cut into 12 squares. This recipe rocks!! ...Auntie Donnaliegh D.","Love it.. so delicious. I spread honey on top :)","I make this recipe for a banana cake lover for years. It is the best banana loaf recipe out of all the ones I try. I don't like to change people's recipes other then to add maybe one thing or take away something. The only thing I do different is add 1\/2 cup sour cream, makes it moist. Thank you for another great recipe. Sandy","Best banana bread ever so simple and awesome every time. My only recommendation is to butter the baking loaf pan. It tastes way better than using the spray. I always use the 4 bananas for extra moisture.","Amazing, and taste great. I used 4 Bananas it is moist as promised. Thank You..","Perfect result, very fine crumb. Great banana flavor I didn't need to put butter on the slices like I usually do. I see why this recipe has so many 5 star reviews.","I didn\u2019t have time to wait for the butter to get to room temp, so I substituted with 1\/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. I used 2 large and 1 medium sized bananas. I also used gluten free flour instead of AP flour. Finally i put in about 1\/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chopped up into chunks. Baked at 350 for about 1h10m. Turned out beautiful! Super moist, couldn\u2019t even tell it was gluten free!","For abou 3years I stopped making banana bread cos it didn\u2019t turned out the way I wanted but this great.","Love this recipe. Baked banana bread twice, and came out excellent both times.","Omg..... I made this banana bread for my family Christmas gathering; I got rave reviews. I thank you so much for the recipe.","After following the instructions, especially the first one about the pots and pans (love it!), this was absolutely delicious, moist inside, slightly crunchy crust. Next time I'll add walnuts for sure. You can't go wrong with this one!","Yesss!!!! Smells good, about to devour it, I used truvia instead of sugar and part applesauce, part butter....","Made for my brother who LOVES banana bread for our Christmas dinner. He absolutely loved it. He wants me to make another one just for him. The only thing I did different was added cinnamon. Try it. It was yummy","Best banana bread recipe ever! I highly recommend making with the 4th banana so good.","this is a great awesome banana bread. it was so moist and I added a strudel topping! Absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe for a large group and it was a hit!","Full cup of sugar seemed too much. I'll cut it back to 3\/4 cup next time. Otherwise, great with three bananas, which seemed to &quot;float&quot; to the top. Very mushy at the crown area.","Awesome!","\u201c55 minute bake time\u201d... except mine was UNDERCOOKED by a long shot! I followed the directions to a T, and even let the banana bread sit in the oven for a few extra minutes the first time it was in the oven. The next day, I noticed more and more sections were completely uncooked. So, I rebaked the banana bread, and almost 30 extra minutes later I got what is photographed. Please use all your tools when checking if food is done. I am trashing this. Even an hour and a half bake-time is not enough time to bake this... why would this recipe say \u201c55 minutes\u201d? How can this be the number one recipe on google when mine turned out the way it did? I cannot be the only one with this problem.","Smells and tastes AMAMZING ! I added some cinnamon before the oven and chocolate kisses after baking ... Mmmmmm!!","I made this with only half a cup of sugar, and sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on the top. Also added some nuts. Delicious!","I made this exactly as written. Amazing moist true banana bread. Thank you!","I made this wonderful recipe today and I must say it came out beautifully. I had 7 bananas so I doubled the recipe and added brown sugar but it came out great. I wish I was more liberal with the white sugar on top and a dusting on the bottom but I like a sweeter tooth than the family so I made it to their liking.","Substitute butter with applesauce. Less calories and tastes great!","VERY GOOD! And simple too! I normally make a recipe as written and do any tweaks later. I'm glad I did this time because it's great as written but I will add nuts next time and it will be even more delicious for my family's taste!","Very easy and delicious.","I loved this recipe! Super simple and fairly quick to make. I added almonds and a TSP of Nutmeg for that extra flavor and it turned out great. However I found that if I use 4 bananas in the mix, the loaf will take about 1 hour and 25-30 mins rather than 55. It came out super moist and I can\u2019t wait to make this again!","This is my go to recipe. Has been for years. Everyone loves it. My husband is allergic to wheat, dairy, and vanilla so I substitute brown rice flour, coconut oil, and maple syrup. I also use 4 over-ripe bananas. Thank you for sharing!","I\u2019ve made this a couple of times and it\u2019s always came out great! We like things extra sweet in our house, so I add a bit of powdered sugar I\u2019ve rthe top when serving, and sometimes I\u2019ll put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. It keeps well too!","It turned out so yummy! i made a few tweaks. I added and extra egg along with buttering and patting brown sugar onto the bottom and sides of the pan. I also cut the bananas into chips and placed them onto the top following it with sprinkling more brown sugar and cinnamon.","My go-to! Always turns out so delicious...I get requests to make it often. Simple and fast!","My favorite recipe. The only thing I substitute from time to time are the eggs. Sometimes i used extra bananas in place. It\u2019s a very delicious quick and easy recipe. I love putting sliced almonds on top.","Very tasty recipe on its own. My kids will be so happy to gobble this up when they get home from school today!!","Can you make these as cupcakes","By far the best and easiest recipe for moist delicious banana bread, I didn\u2019t really do any tweaking to the recipe just added pecans and chia seeds. It was still kinda wet it the middle after 55 minutes so I added another 5 minutes and it came out great. The kids ate half of it before it was even cooled down! I will be making this again and again! Now I need to go buy more bananas!","This bread was awesome. I added some chocolate chips (not a lot) and it was so yummy! Very easy to make!","Not sure what I did but 55 minutes resulted in an over cooked cake and it did not rise. The only tweak I made was to add 1\/2 cup of Craisins. This is my first fail with banana bread and I'm very disappointed. Only saving grace is my husband likes burnt toast and he said he will eat this 'burnt cake - he is not a cake eater usually!!!","I used 4 bananas and it was dry not the best recipe","the second time I made this I added a toffee pecan topping - SO delicious!!","I have used this recipe several times and it is the best one so far, The only thing I add is a few shots of Banana liquor, it gives it a little more Banana taste and it makes it a little moister.","Oh My Gooness this is the best recipe. We all raved about it!!!!!! I added the four bananas( very moist) and I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead. Thank you to whom ever developed this recipe :-) Terry.C","Good, but a little sweet for my tastes. I used the 4 bananas.","Still in the oven but I didn't use butter I used vege oil","Seriously the best banana bread you will ever have. So moist and yummy. I got so many compliments on it!! I only baked it for about 45 minutes and it was perfect. Definitely wouldn\u2019t do the whole 55. :)","Made this on the fly and it turned out amazing!! Seriously best banana bread ever. I added chocolate chips for a bit of chocolate flavor and it tasted great. Highly recommend! It actually reminds me of the bread on the road to hana in maui.","Best Banana Bread Ever! I finish the top off with crushed walnuts and brown sugar. I also add 1 teaspoon of Vanilla and 1 teaspoon of Cinnamon to the recipe. In the oven as I write this, make it every Sunday.","Followed the recipe, turned out great!! Best banana bread I've ever made!","Amazing ! I used gluten free flour instead of regular flower and Himalayan salt instead of regular salt. Also. I didn\u2019t know what they meant by \u201coil\u201d didn\u2019t know what type of oil to use. So I used used a little more butter then what was called for. I absolutely loved it. I followed the rest. I found that it was ready in 35 Mins instead of 55 Mins. Probably because of the gluten free flour I used. Loved it. So yum","It was too sweet with 1 cup of sugar, reduce sugar to 3\/4th cup. I added half cup of pecans.","Made it tonight and it turned out Amazing! Almost too good! I added chocolate chips to the inside and walnuts to the top.","Excellent, used 4 Bananas ??","Mine turned out perfect. I used 4 bananas and a pinch of cinnamon. Mmmm","I usually don't like it very sweet so I opted to use 1\/2 cup of sugar only but used 5 pcs of bananas and turned out just as I wanted it.. love the recipe!!","iss iitt good","It added nutmeg and cinnamon to my first batch. It was so good.","We made it with 4 bananas and it was awesome! Everyone loved it!","Yum! Was looking for a recipe to use up a bag of gooey bananas and tried this. I made two batches - one with crushed walnuts through it and the other with choc chips in it. Both went down so well that I am now being given gooey bananas by workmates in the hope I'll make more! Thanks","True to recipe title! Best banana bread recipe!! Real keeper!","It was the best Banana bread I ever had, and we added some greenery to it for a lovely buzz.","First time making banana bread and it turned out delicious.","I always come back to this recipe! I've made it with so many variations and it's always a hit. I've got gluten free muffin versions in the oven right now, used 5 bananas. Last time I made it, I got a skeptic thinking it was a store bought bread. ?","Best recipe I have found! Easy and quick. I did add chopped pecans. Very moist!","I searched Google for &quot;the best banana bread recipe ever,&quot; and they were right on the money. I had four really ripe bananas begging to be used, and it was amazingly moist and flavorful. I didn't cut into it for almost two hours after taking it out. At first I thought it was underdone, but it was this incredible banana layer on the bottom. Absolutely the best I have ever tasted. I used Einkorn flour and Swerve sugar replacer. I had only one egg, so I threw in a dash of baking powder. It took nearly 1 1\/2 hours to bake, but it was well worth it.","This is wonderful!! Extremely moist and delicious.","Finally a perfect Banana Bread Recipe! Didn\u2019t change a thing (except lay foil over top at 30 minutes in to prevent over-browning) even though I am at high altitude. Husband LOVED it!","Delicious and so moist. Use at least 2 bananas and three is perfect.","Oh my goodness.......perfection!","moist and delicious! I added 1\/2 tsp cinnamon and 1\/4 tsp nutmeg, then I sprinkled top with some raw sugar before baking","Delicious!!!!!! I put in chocolate chunks and it tasted even better!","this is delish. I subbed with 1\/2 wheat flour and half honey for the sugar and with those healthier subs it was still serious yummy, rich and almost caramel-ly!? (maybe from the honey) I also added a glob of sour cream. My only issue was it got really brown and crusty around the edges while the top center was still mushy so idk next time if I make it in a bigger pan so it not so deep maybe it will cook more evenly?","Is it 350 or 180? Is one Celsius? Why not specify?? It's unclear.","Very easy to make. I cut back on the sugar to 3\/4C just due to personal preference. Very light which I prefer to a denser bread.","Followed the recipe to a T and then added some walnuts. This is by far the best banana bread recipe I have ever made. Sweet, light, not heavy like most, and very moist, even though I only used 3 bananas. This was better then my moms recipe! Sorry mom! Oh, and it\u2019s a very simple recipe also.","very good! i added more bananas","Added walnut and cinnamon great bread and super easy. FYI I used whole-wheat flour, sugar in the raw and home-made extract and everything came out perfectly. ??","Just made this today and it was delicious! I added walnuts though. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.","I made four loaves total. One was plain banana bread, two were chocolate chip banana bread, and the last one was peanut butter chocolate chip banana bread. All for of my kids and my coworkers loved them!","I made them into a dozen muffins, and only baked for 35minutes. Came out moist","it turned okay but it looks good","This is the EXACT recipe that my Grandma used and gave to me when I looked at her recipes as a teen girl and putting them in myope chest. That was about 35 years ago! My husband will not eat another banana bread!","Awesome recipe. This was my first bake and it came out really good and moist, it's not too sweet either, just the way I like it.","This is a simple and delicious recipe! I used 3 bananas and added the vanilla. I also cooked it longer than the suggested time. I added six minutes cooking time and also left it in the oven with it off for about ten minutes. It significantly changed the color; however it was very not done when I checked it just before the estimated cooking time. It's a little crunchy on the outside and perfect on the inside. :)","I wanted to make something for my friends for Valentines, so I doubled the recipe, used 7 bananas and the vanilla. It made enough to fill 5 mini loaf pans! I baked it for 58 minutes. For my first try I think it came out great!","Great recipe! I had been making the same banana bread recipe for awhile and was in search for a new one. The old recipe only had 3 tbsp of butter, while this one has 1\/2 cup. Wow, it makes a difference! I used 4 bananas and sprinkled cinnamon in the batter. Delicious!","These turned out great and are perfect for my child's classroom snack. All his classmates loved them! Making another batch for snacktime tomorrow.","Loved the suggestion in directions, &quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven.&quot;","Super easy. Very moist I don\u2019t like walnuts but will add pecans and a touch of cinnamon next time. :)","Delicious, easy, new go-to recipe! Cut sugar back to 3\/4 cup. Used 4 large over-ripe bananas. Added a touch of freshly grated nutmeg to dry ingredients. Decorated the top of 4 mini loaves with a row of walnut pieces. Baked for 35 minutes. So moist and flavorful!","I followed the recipe to a T, with three bananas, and it was hands down the best banana bread I've ever had. Instead of making a loaf, I made muffins. Same temp for 22 mins and they were perfect!","can i make this with all purpose gluten free flour?","As I am at high altitude, I had to bake this for 12 minutes longer and it was perfect. I also added chopped dates. Great recipe with wonderful texture and taste. Highly recommend.","1\/2 teaspoon of nutmeg into mixture. Pour half of the batter into bread pan add the topping of cinnamon and sugar, then add the rest of batter then sprinkle more of cinnamon and sugar. Does the trick each time. My family always asks for more!!! Got them hooked!","After 55 minutes was soup. In and out of oven at 5 minute intervals four times. Haven\u2019t tasted yet but definitely took a good 20 minutes longer than expected","Yet to make, will definitely get good stars. Just read the reviews hope outcome will be as great as reviews.","Added Pecans","I substituted 1\/2 c.of almond butter for the 1\/2 of butter.I might try peanut butter next time. Although it might be way too strong of a flavor... I substituted 1\/2 c of applesauce and 1\/2 c honey for the 1 c. of sugar. My husband even thought it was good.","Delicious first time ever making it","Followed recipe to include the optional vanilla extract...bread loaf was moist, soft and fluffy. I also poured batter into two loaf pans instead of one so that it wasn\u2019t too dense and thick when finished.","Not sure about this recipe so far. Why not add baking powder instead of baking soda? Baking soda and a 1\/2 teaspoon of salt seems it would make it salty. Also, there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough flour to wet ingredients. Very dubious to how this will turn out as the batter is very soupy. **UPDATE** Turned out fine. The taste was very banana-y and texture moist. The only problem was turning it out of the loaf pan as the bottom stuck despite having been buttered and floured. I used a glass loaf pan.","I've been using this recipe for years, but now I started to add to mine. Here's some optional for your bread: Add blueberries and grounded flax seeds. Banana and nuts. Banana and chocolate chips. Mix half white flour and the other half with whole wheat. This is a fun recipe. I love it.","Ba-nan-a-mazing!! I have tried many recipes and this by far is the best yet! The constancy was perfect. I used 4 bananas as that is what I needed to get rid of and the flavor was perfect and moist. This one is a keeper. ??","I wanted a higher protein banana bread, so I took this same recipe but instead of 1.5 cups flour, I substituted 1\/2 cup oat flour (pulverized oats) and 1\/2 cup vanilla plant-based protein powder and 1 cup all purpose flour. Since the protein powder is sweet, I only added 1\/2 cup sugar. I used olive oil for the butter. I also added cinnamon. This meant I had to reduce the cooking time to 35 minutes. Anyway the banana bread was delicious, and a little more filling with the extra boost of protein.","Absolutely fool proof just like it is. 4 bananas, doubled it, did it single batch, added macadamia nuts one time...consistently perfect!","I made it with 3 banana's and the vanilla and I've got to say, this was one of the best banana breads I've ever had. Next time I will make it with the 4.","Awesome banana bread recipe! This is replacing my grandmother\u2019s that I\u2019ve been using for years. I made this on a whim with my 11 year old son. I chose it because it was a nice basic recipe without too many frills or ingredients to add. I was lazy and used the muffin method (dry in one bowl, wet in another, then mix together gently and bake) and it still turned out excellent. Everyone was raving about the flavor. Less is definitely more here! No need for spices and extra vanilla, no buttermilk or sour cream or yogurt tang, just straight up banana flavor shining through! Moist, not overly dense. Highly recommend!!! Also, the first instruction to \u201cremove odd pots and pans from the oven\u201d, priceless! That happens to me all the time. Glad I\u2019m not the only one....","Went with three bananas. Added 1\/2 cup chopped walnuts. Took 68 min on a KithchenAid propane stove. But looks great!","Excellent simple recipe! A family favorite. I use 4 bananas and add the vanilla. While cooling I wrap in a plastic bag to caramelize the exterior. Fabulous every time!","The Best banana bread recipe!","Delicious!","It really is the best...Have made several times..always awesome","Changed the flour into gluten-free flour since I'm gluten sensitive. Still turns out good!","Super easy, fast to make, and delicious. I won\u2019t use another recipe. If anything, next time I\u2019ll add in chocolate chips!","I used 4 ripe bananas and only half the amount of sugar (1\/2 cup) and it came out moist and sweet. Simply delicious.","I'm making this today, guessing flour = plain flour? I'm using brown sugar in mine, can't wait to see how it turns out :D","So basically there's no nutrition at all because it's all sugar! What a ripoff!!","Great easy recipe. I only had self raising flour. Came out fab also added chocolate chips!","Cooked and turned out beautifully. Added the walnuts....superb, will use this again, but half the sugar content. Teeth tingling a bit","Great recipe! The banana loaf top is really crunchy with brown crust and is moist in the center.","Certainly NOT the last banana bread recipe that I\u2019ll ever need. I made this bread yesterday. First, cut the sugar down to 3\/4 cup at MOST. Second, stick with 3 bananas. 4 makes a very packy gummy bread even when cooked to 200 degrees F internal temp. Which leads me to Third, you need to specify an internal temp when cooked. Fourth, add more salt! Bland, bland, BLAND! Fifth, could you include cooling instructions? Too bad this recipe stops short of the promise to be the last one needed. Glad I\u2019ve got more bananas to test another recipe.","I really enjoyed this banana bread recipe. Super simple and came out delicious. Crisp outside and soft moist middle. Yum!","Very good recipe.","I've made this twice now - it is amazing! Once used 3 bananas and last night I only had 2 and it was still absolutely delicious. I use whole wheat flour!","It turned out very well. I\u2019ll definitely be making this version again, maybe add a little cinnamon or brown sugar but it was delicious!","I switched a few items due to dietary restrictions and needing more protein. I added 2 servings of unflavored protein powder, olive oil (5 tbsp) in place of butter, raisins, dark chocolate chips, pecans, and spenda in place of sugar. I also made these as cupcakes = easily portable for kids lunches :-) They turned out excellent. If you make cupcakes make sure to bake them for 30 minutes instead of the length of time you need for a loaf. Thank you for posting this recipe.","Too sweet when I followed the recipe exactly, Most people not realize you can halve sugar in baking muffins, loaves etc. I did just that the second time and it was perfect. I also added walnuts as banana bread needs it!","It isn't my favorite recipe. The flavors good. Had to cook an extra 14 min to get it cooked all the way.","I am baking this for the 5th time as I type! Great recipe...moist and delicious. I add only 3\/4c. sugar (brown) and a touch more salt along with the 4th banana and walnuts. It turns out perfectly every time.","This was so good","Love this recipe and love banana bread! I added the vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of bread before baking. The cinnamon sugar goes well with the banana flavor! Try it!","I have made countless banana bread recipes over the years, and I bake a lot. This recipe, will end my search for a simply delicious banana bread. I was hesitant to try it because it has so few ingredients. What? No sour cream? No yogurt? This cannot be that good. Boy was I wrong. Do yourself a favour and try it. Just trust me on this one. I added walnut and that upped the flavour a tad although, it really didn't need it.","Made this a couple of times now! It always turns out amazing, by fair the best banana bread recipe!","This sounds delicious! I'm wondering if anyone's tried it with less butter and sugar than recommended. Or is it as good as it is because it has so much sweet and buttery goodness?","Dear Anna; I use margarine instead of butter just because I don't have to wait for it to get soft. I also use Splenda instead of sugar since we have a diabetic in the family, they are not as sweet but may family and friends like them and there are never leftover. but my signature tweak is pecan and coconut flakes, no measuring, just a handful each, bake as muffins instead of loaf and kids love them.","I doubled the recipe , used brown bananas (6) , it turned out really moist and sweet but not to sweet. I want to try using brown sugar next time instead of white. Good simple recipe tho. Will definitely be making it again.","I\u2019ve never tried it nor made it. This was a very delicious and baker friendly recipe.","I have looked and looked and tried many banana breads. I guess I was looking for one like my Great Grandmother would make. Now I found it and I am so happy! Yummy!","Best Banana bread ever! I used 4 ripe bananas. The bread was eaten so fast that I knew this would be in my fav recipe collection! I loved it and shared it with many people to get their opinion. Survey says, &quot;REAL MOIST!&quot; Delicious!","Great loved it","I messed up somewhere and the bread came out really dark (not burnt at all) but it tastes just like what my mother makes!","Perfect wouldn't change a thing","Came out a bit under baked and dark, but delicious and buttery! It lasted all of 3 days in our home. It's a keeper!","I have been using this banana bread recipe for years and everyone has always loved it. I make it exactly as written. However, recently I have been eliminating eggs and dairy from my diet. I replaced the butter with coconut oil exactly and the two eggs with a half cup unsweetened applesauce with a teaspoon of baking powder. It came out delicious, obviously the texture is a little different but no sacrifice in taste. No one even realizes it\u2019s vegan!","I make mine with a teaspoon of cinnamon, a(bout) full teaspoon of vanilla, the 4th banana, a little more than a 6th cup of plain Greek yogurt, add a dash extra soda, and a tad bit more flour to even out the modifications. Oh, and an extra egg, but only the egg white. Perfect, moist, great flavor. For muffins, put in the oven for 15 minutes for perfection. Add powdered sugar on the top while still warm for a little extra touch (it makes a difference, a very good one). I never follow a recipe to a T","Figured I had too much batter but still decided I would make only one loaf because of the superb reviews. Was very disappointed when my loaf had to burn on top just to finish cooking. Sure it\u2019s a fine recipe, but the yield was definitely off.","Turned out perfectly. I followed the directions given with one exception, I used brown sugar, vanilla bean paste and added pecans. I also used 4 medium bananas that were ripened to almost black. Yum!","This recipe is delicious and was a big hit with my family. I used 4 bananas to ensure a moist and very &quot;banana-ee&quot; bread. The tweaks I made to this yummy recipe were using 1\/2 brown sugar and 1\/2 white sugar and adding about 1\/2 a cup of walnuts. I love when the outside crust of the bread is slightly crunchy and caramelized and the brown sugar helps make that happen. Next time I plan on making the bread without changing anything just for fun. Can't wait to try it out.","&quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven.&quot; I love that this is the first step! Planning to make this today.","This is the first banana bread I've made and my family really loved it. I used about half the sugar.","I made a double batch and used 4 medium sized bananas. I substituted half of the butter for yogurt and only put in one cup of sugar. After I had it in the oven for about half an hour, I noticed that I had forgot to put the eggs in! I was a little worried that it would be crumbly, but it came out of the pans just fine and it was nice and moist. It rose beautifully and smelled really good too. It was a nice golden brown on top. It made my day! Thank you so much for a great recipe.","This recipe was so good and easy to follow! I played around a bit, like added a tablespoon more butter, added a teaspoon of baking powder into the mashed bananas to make them fluffier, and mixed some melted dark chocolate on top and made them muffins and it was DELISH! the perfect time for the muffins was 25 mins and i made about 15 muffins! Super light and fluffy!","I don't measure anything. Never have. This recipe is awesome! My entire family loves this recipe! Thank you!","My daughter said, \u201cdelightful fluffy with hints of vanilla and full bodied banana. She ate it straight from the oven. My grandson and I ate brownies everyone was happy","Great recipe. Moist, well balanced, and so so easy! Was a hit with all the ladies at my work.","Delicious, love this recipe, thanks!","I followed the recipe exactly and it was the best banana bread I ever tasted!","All the hype is actuale true this one is the best &amp; it is versitile as you can add --chocolate chips as i did! Nuts are an option! Dried fruits. But it is amazingly perfect on its own!","I wanted something different.. So instead of flour i went with rice.. Blend it into the machine and used it as flour cause thats how my late granny used to make it.. Turned out good by the way","Im 13 and have made this countless times. Amazing recipe, I give it to friends and teachers at school and everybody loves it. 10 out of 10 Would recommend. Always turns out great with the easy instructions.","Wow this banana bread is mind blowingly delicious! I made it again because the first time I forgot the bananas (still good). Just like the first time, this is the best banana bread I've ever had. I accidentally preheated my oven to 850 degrees but luckily I got it out before it turned completely black. There were even leftovers which I gave to friends and people I saw outside. I plan on making this again but might try tweaking the amount of time it cooks.","Made an account just for this recipe after the 5th time using it :). The first step called out to me from the get go lol. This recipe is incredibly versatile. I've added 3\/4 cup of blueberries in one recipe, walnuts in another and just the original way. It's a family favorite and has been added to my go-to recipes!","This banana bread recipe is one of the best I've used","I\u2019ve made this recipe many times... Always turns out well. I\u2019ve made this recipe different times with a 1\/2 cup or 3\/4 cup of sugar... Turns out great both ways.","Made this last night. I think it took me about 5-minutes to put together. The hard part was waiting for it to cool! Wow. So very, very good. I will never compost my old bananas again.","Just came fresh from the oven! My husband couldn't wait since this delicious smell made him stop doing whatever he was doing. Very moist and delicious. I used 3 sliced bananas and cooked at 325 for 50mins. I used almond flour instead and only 1\/2 cup of sugar (brown). Also added 1 tsp of cinnamon, pinch of nutmeg and some walnuts. It was sweet enough. Thank you! I highly recommend this!! :)","EXCELLENT -- TRULY is the BEST Banana Bread -- so simple and delicious... and yes, i did have to move the pans out of my oven before I stated--thank you for the reminder!","I usually don't rate anything but this turned out soooo good I had to. In love perfect recipe. I will never look for another one. Everyone loved it","Wow, a delicious recipe!! First banana bread I ever baked! Hubby approved :D","This banana bread was really good. My family loves it and I even put pecans in one of them ????","Wonderful Recipe every time I make it everyone prasises me a lot thank you for the wonderful recipe","The best banana bread and didn\u2019t last 24 hours in my household! I used 3\/4 cups turbinado sugar and 1\/4 cup coconut sugar and 4 organic bananas. Organic tastes so much better. I used the full serving of Madagascar vanilla and used brown eggs. I also softened the butter to mix better with the sugar. I also used Himalayan salt and 365 all purpose flour. The most perfect banana bread! Next time I\u2019m going to add the cacao nibs from Trader Joe\u2019s.","1st loaf ever. Grew up in a family of nine, my mom baked twice a week all kinds of breads, pies and pastries. Should be interesting, I used organic whole wheat flour. After reading store bread ingredients It scared the heck out of me ! So here iam. Not a fan of processed bleached white sugar, will raw natural sugar work. Also I used sea salt instead of &quot;processed&quot; salt.","Best banana bread recipe I've ever used! Every time I make it, I get endless compliments from my family.","I made this using unsalted butted, I increase the salt to 1 tsp., and used 3-1\/2 large ripe bananas. I forgot to add vanilla. However I loved the finished product so I took a loaf to church and it was a big hit. I got lots of compliments.","I would have to advise, this a very addictive and awesome in taste Banana Bread, I am baking it for the second time due to wife's suggestion ...","So so good! I only cut back on the sugar a little (just over 3\/4 cup) because I used 4 very ripe bananas. I will absolutely make this again.","I love myself some good homemade banana bread!","Very good!","Hi, several times i tried making cake but for the first time it was a success. The most i like about this recipe is that its given in very simple method. With basic ingredients used the outcome was just superb. Thank you","Moist and yummy. I added half cup of white sugar and half cup of brown sugar instead. My mom's classic recipe always asked for brown. I softened the butter as well before mixing. Turned out perfect. Just wrap up after cooling for it to stay moist.","This was hands-down the best banana bread I have ever made! I ended up baking my loaf 5 minutes less than recipe called for, because that's when my toothpick came out clean. It got so many compliments, I know I'll be making it again!","No matter what I do these come out awsome.","This recipe is AMAZING! It really is the BEST banana bead!!","I absolutely love this banana bread. So moist and delishous and so easy to make. I\u2019m hooked!","Very good, I added chopped pecans and used 3 very large banana's. Easy and a great way to use banana's that are going south. Not a huge fan of banana bread till now. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon when I added the vanilla (last). A little crunchy outside and moist inside. Best banana bread to date.","I added raisins to my first loaf and followed the rest of the recipe to the T. By far the best banana bread I\u2019ve had. I gave a loaf to the dealers at the casino and everyone loved it. Tonight I have one in the oven and instead of raisins I added strawberries. Waiting to see what happens","i followed the directions except added pecans. It is so dark.","This is the best one. It just is. I sub out sugar for honey- 1\/2 cup.","The best one I hav ever made. My family loved it. I sub half of the sugar for coconut sugar. Also spice it up with pumpkin spice. As well I used 5 bananas 4 in and one cut up and put on top with a little bitter. I did not add pecans.","The best banana bread recipe I have made in my life...cannot wait for my bananas to get a little over ripe again to make it! I used 5 bananas and it was excellent! I didn't tweak anything, but next time I think I will half the sugar and use some honey.","I was wondering I put in on the oven for the time needed and is still came out like it wasn't finished was this supposed to happen it still taste good though","This was the best Banana Bread recipe! I didnt have eggs so I replaced with 1\/3 applesauce for each egg and added chopped walnuts. It was sooooo moist! Thanks for the great recipe. Now hopefully they'll be some left for my hubby. :~)","I believe this is the second time I have used this recipe. The first one came out excellent. The second is still in the oven. TY.","I run a bed and breakfast and bake four mini loaves daily. My guests love this. I usually send some home with them. I don't use a full cup of sugar; not sure how much I'm using but I don't top off the measuring cup. The sugars in the bananas add a lot of sweetness - you really don't need a full cup of the white stuff.","My family really enjoyed it. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon the second time as requested by my daughter. It was delicious! Then my son asked me to make it again so he could slice it and use it for french toast. Holy cow that was a brilliant idea. I, for one, am finished searching for the perfect banana bread recipe. Thank you for sharing it!","I love this recipe, my mom couldn't stop eating it, and everyone else wants me to bake it for her birthday. Thumbs up to the creator(s)!!!","I have made this into breads, muffins, mini muffins, added nuts, added chocolate chips, streusel, and it's a never-fail hit every single time. SO worth jotting down this recipe in your book for keeps.","Added Chocolate chips, and mmmmm mmmmm was it ever delicious!! ??? Thanks for the recipe.","Amazing everyone loves it and it\u2019s super easy to make. I always use the four bananas","Great recipe. I like that it's lower in fat than most. What with the &quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven?&quot; Lol. Also remember to hook up the gas line, and shoo any stray marauders out of the kitchen.","Amazing, easy recipe. I put four bananas in my blender and it really distributed the flavor better than mashing ever has for me. I did tweak it a little, but only to amp up the flavor! I put in about a handful of crushed walnuts and sprinkled the top with a few more and some brown sugar. You can forego the nuts for whatever reason you may have but Lord in the heavens above sprinkle the brown sugar it is irresistible!! Next time I'm going to add imitation banana extract instead of vanilla. I think then it will be the most absolutely perfect recipe ever.","I added chocolate chips to the mixture. The mixture was hot. The chips melted. Now the bread is the color of chocolate. It is currently in the oven. I think it will be tasty. ??","My banana bread turned out like formed pudding even after 1.5 hrs in the oven. What could i be doing wrong? Any tips? Thanks!","So it did turned out goey like others, just baked it longer and it was the best ever. Tip. Drop the temp to 275\/300 and bake for almost 2 hours","I've never had a banana bread turn out so poorly. It's more like banana pudding. It tastes ok but not what I wanted at all. Also cooked for an extra half an hour. It's pretty flat and way gooey.","Really delicious! It is really gooey with the recommended baking time so you do need to bake for an extra 30-40 minutes. Like a previous post said 275-300 for 2 hours or what I did was 60 minutes at 375 and 30 minutes at 300.","Whoever asked about the calories content here is a rough guess. The entire loaf has about 2,749 cal. Based on the 10 serving measurement, each slice contains about 274.9 calories. I will definitely be creating this recipe with healthier alternatives and posting it tomorrow!","Best recipe ever! So easy to make...I only had two overripe bananas but followed the recipe to the letter (no tweaks) and it turned out perfectly...plenty of banana flavor and beautifully moist.","This is an amazing recipe.. Just add a little cinnamon and put it in cupcake containers(350* for 12-20 minutes) it makes a great gift, or something to have for dessert.","Perfect and more, every time.","I made it with four bananas and added an extra 1\/3 cup flour. The end result was pretty heavy and disappointing for me. The batter didn't rise like I was hoping.","Hi ~ I just made my first Banana Bread ????. It came out Perfect &amp; Delicious ??!","first time I was making banana bread I was lucky enough to find this recipe because I was ready for a disaster but this made my banana bread taste like I've been making it for years like a pro! lol best recipe ever","I didnt read the instructions properly and ended up blending the liquid ingredients too much. So what i did was double the dry ingredients and made 2 bread. which came out amazing. What I also did instead of increases the sugar in the mixture was to mix honey brown sugar and hot water in a separate bowl and glazed once the bread was finished","I always use this recipe for Banana Bread but I also add a teaspoon of mixed spice and sprinkle demarara sugar on the top for an sweet crunchy topping..","Made it for cookout and 100% sure it will be gone by tonight!","I just have a question about the baking soda. I thought that was only supposed to be used when there was an acid in the recipe. Otherwise baking powder should be used . There is no acid in this recipe (e.g. buttermilk) so why the baking soda ?","Best banana bread",null,"Turned out perfect. will save to make again. Thanks","I cooked on 350 but had to cook for 15 minutes more than recommended time (could be because of my oven). Really yummy. I added 4 bananas as suggested.","Amazing!!! My family asks for this all the time. I recommend using 3 very large bananas, or 4 smaller\/regular sized. 4 large makes it a little mushy :)","Fabulous. Our family loved it!","Made banana bread for the first time! The only thing I did was half cup of sugar, cinnamon, and shredded carrots! So tasty!","Such a simple and awesome recipe. I completely line the entire pan with parchment paper and spray with Pam. Cover the top of bread with a piece of foil loosely for half of the baking time and start checking cake at 45 minutes to see if it's done. Otherwise, 55 minutes is too long in my oven.","This is an extraordinarily delicious recipe. It fills the house with a sweet aroma, and all my friends love it too! It's also very simple and easy to prepare.","Teawked it a little, added some more butter, Turned out great, added chocolate chips, cinnamon and nutmeg.","I have made these about 6 or 7 times now, and plan on making them again and again and again. I've never been much of a baker, I didn't really enjoy baking, and if I had to bake something it was usually out of a box, but this recipe changed all of that. My guy doesn't like sugary things much, but he loves banana bread. I tried a couple of other recipes before discovering this website and this recipe. He loves these, anyone who tries them loves them and I love how easy and versatile they are. And making these and having them turn out so perfect every time gave me the self confidence to try more recipes and now I bake all the time and I shudder at the thought of using a boxed mix. This recipe is fantastic as is, but is also a fantastic base recipe. Whenever I have small amounts of leftover chocolate chips, walnuts, blueberries, coconut, pumpkin, caramel or whatever other random ingredient that sounds good I add it to the batter of individual muffins before baking, which is awesome because I then have a nice mix of different muffins at the end. I have started making them somewhat regularly, and learning how to bake in the process. I am going to try some of the tweaks other people have posted and I also want to experiment with different gluten free flours, I think because this recipe is so simple and consistently makes awesome muffins it is a great one to start learning how to work with different flours and sweeteners, plus learning how to use different egg and dairy substitutes, I have gained a hobby, a love for baking (plus 10 pounds, laugh), that not only makes me happy, but also makes my guy, my friends, and my co workers happy. All thanks to the best banana bread recipe ever.","Love this recipe! I made some changes and it still came out great. Instead of oil I used half cup of applesauce and two tablespoons mayo. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg. I will make it again","It\u2019s worth using my Kerry gold butter!??. I made this first time hours before going camping. Still warm on the way. It didn\u2019t last long. Came out perfect! I baked double batch in a cake pan (roughly 40-45 mins) added some walnuts. It\u2019s very moist and not too sweet. Will make it again.","This is a GREAT recipe. 10\/10","Amazing bread! I substituted the butter for coconut oil and didn't add all the sugar in. I also added in chocolate chips and pecans. After pouring it in the pan I sprinkled turbinado sugar and cinnamon on top. A winner in our household!","That's a delcious and tasty recipe thanks for sharing with us your great recipe loved it.","Deliciousness!","Best when cooled but recently it if the oven when the crispy top is irresistable. Otherwise it is moist and flavorful. I added 2 tablespoons of pancake syrup after reducing the sugar to 3\/4 cup to add some additional flavor. Very good recipe.","Worst banana cake recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and my cake came out with the consistency of APPLE SAUCE.","Pretty good. Not bad for my first attempt","Use this recipe all the time. Family loves it","Sorry, this ended up with the texture of tofu, may need more flour.","I absolutely love this recipe. My family goes ape over it!","My family went BANANAS over this recipe.! Thank you","how did you iknow i keep my extra pots and pans in the oven?????? bread was Fantastic!!!!!!!!","OMG this was the best banana bread I have ever tasted. Full of flavor, very moist just so very delicious! I will definitely make this again!","This Is a great recipe! The oven I used sucks keeps messing up the rise on everything I put in it but taste awesome!","DONT DOUBLE THE RECIPE. So I've tried a single and it's amazing, very easy to tweak. It's good if you add chocolate chips or blue berries. I haven't tried it myself, but heard good things about adding strawberries. Anyway. Doubling the recipe causes it to rise faster and it kinda keeps the bread from cooking all the way. Nearly impossible to cook longer or the outside burns. Added note I did freeze the bananas and then that. So it could have been that or too many bananas.","wow, this recipe is amazing! my family literally fights over who gets the last piece! it's super delicious, and the banana flavor is amazing. i also have a few tweaks to make this recipe better! i added brown instead of white sugar, and i also didn't use a whole stick of butter. i used about 7\/8 of the stick. i would recommend using 4 bananas, they make the bread more moist and the banana flavor is more strong. i also would recommend using the vanilla, even though it says optional. but, i used a whole teaspoon instead of half. last, but not least, are the things to add into the batter! i add a handful of mini chocolate chips and walnuts. i also bought a cinnamon and sugar mix-in for this bread. that mix-in makes the bread a whole lot better! i would definitely recommend this recipe, it's the best one i've tried!","Good recipe!! I added some cinnamon and a splash of milk ..Thank you !","Love this recipe! I have made it 10+ times and love it! I always add milk chocolate chips and use 4 bananas...so good! Last time I added chia seeds too and it went well!","Really moist. Am surprised it\u2019s not that hard to make. Tried and tasted. Yummy!??","I loved this easy recipe. The flavor is so good. I used coconut extract instead of vanilla to give it a little Caribbean flavor","I tried this when I had nothing to do with my bananas that were turning black. Luckily I came across this post and actually tried something that I saw on the internet.... Lol. This turned out great! Loved the addition of a hint of salt. Thanx for breaking it down for us newbies.","Absolutely delicious! I made it according to the recipe with one tweak: instead of 1-1\/2 cups of all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup all-purpose and 1\/2 cup King Arthur whole wheat flour. (I mention the brand only because it is the only whole wheat flour I have used). I had four seriously brown bananas, so I exercised the option for the extra. Honestly, I think the fourth banana is a necessity. The 55-minute time frame is right on the money. This is the best banana bread I have made, but I confess that I don't bake very often. Usually my bananas are eaten before they have a chance to brown :).","Who doesn't love a go-to recipe that consistently comes out great? Good basic structure with this recipe, next time I'm going to try making it chocolate by substituting 1\/4cup flour with 1\/4cup cocoa powder and adding a heavy dose of chocolate chips??. I also made these gluten free and dairy free and the recipe was totally fine using gf flour and vegan butter. My go-to modifications: always 1tbsp of vanilla extract, 4 small ripened bananas, and just a dash of almond extract???? These came out perfectly moist with just the right amount of balance between sweet treat and banana??","when I was done baking I wet a paper towel squeezed it out... put it on top of the pyrex and then covered with a dish towel... to finish baking and retain moistness","Delicious and moist! I followed the recipe with two exceptions. I used 3\/4 cup white sugar and 1\/4 cup brown sugar. I also added mini chocolate chips. Yum! My only complaint is that it is too much batter for one loaf pan. I should have split it in two and cooked it for about half the time. As it was, the outside was overcooked by the time the inside was done. I cut the edges off my slice and it tasted delicious though. Give it a try!","the bananas must be very very ripe","I tried it out and it turned out a little doughy. I even put it in the oven for extra time and then it turned out dry.","I have made this banana bread many times and the only adjustment I occasionally make is to add a handful of chopped nuts. The moisture is incredible. Sometimes I add 4 bananas, if I have them and goodness, the moisture is incredible. It stores well in the fridge or freezer. I will often slice and wrap and store pieces in the freezer and when thawed are just as delicious as the day it was baked. If you haven\u2019t tried this recipe yet, run out and get some ripe bananas and make this delicious, easy, banana bread. EVERYONE will thank you!","Just made it this morning. This is the most moist banana bread I have ever tasted. The loaves turned out great.","Perfect banana bread as written. Most use oil, this is butter based &amp; more cake-y &amp; delicious. I've added walnuts, Cocoanut, still great. Never had a loaf last more than a day, every time I make it, my son &amp; husband scarf it down, &amp; they aren't usually real big cake eaters. Use the extra banana. When my bananas are reaching that overripe point, I put them in freezer. When I'm ready to make banana bread, I thaw 4 bananas, which will now be brown. But that's perfect for this recipe. This is now my go-to banana bread recipe. 5*****!!!!","Hi It turned out fantastically, very yummy. Jill Englert","great base recipe. my adjustments are to over-ripen the bananas, use 3\/4 cups sugar, add 1\/2 cup chopped walnuts.. and perfecto! but also for a bit of extra structure i combine 1\/2 cup of harder flour with a cup of the all purpose","I made this recipe yesterday and it came out perfect! I used 4 bananas and no vanilla and it was buttery banana deliciousness! It also keeps really well, at least overnight.","This is the second time I have made this recipe. THE BEST banana bread recipe I have ever tried by far. I did modify slightly (because who doesn't!), putting in 1\/3 coconut flour and chocolate chips the first time - delicious. This time I doubled the recipe, again used 1\/3 coconut flour and put blueberries for the bananas in the second batch. I used 4 bananas for 1-1\/2C so same for the blueberries. Another winner!","The best banana bread i have made. It moist. I added some walnuts and raisins. It turned out very good.","This is truly the best banana bread I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used very, almost too, ripe bananas, and only 3. Wonderfully delicious. Thank you, I will be using this recipe from now on.","After trying three different banana bread recipes this week this is definitely the winner by far. I had a lottt of bananas that all had sat for far too long and my girlfriend suggested I try my hand at making banana bread for the first time. I made two other recipes before this one that just didn't have that &quot;mmmf&quot; factor you want from a good banana bread, this one does. It is so moist. I used 3 bananas which gave it just the right amount of banana flavor, and the right amount of sweetness as well. So happy I finally found this recipe! On a side note I did tweak it just a little bit, but nothing crazy and I can tell it would be just as great cooking it as is. I did 3\/4 cups white sugar, and 1\/4 cup brown sugar. I only used 1\/4 teaspoon of vanilla. I added cinnamon (just followed my intuition on the amount, you know what I'm talking about) and added chopped walnuts as well. I baked it in a greased 8&quot; x 4&quot; loaf pan, was the perfect size pan for it in my opinion. I also covered it with foil for the last 30 minutes which helps prevent the top from getting too dark and brown. Came out perfect and can't wait to make it again for friends and family.","FABULOUS EVERY TIME!","Just finished making this Banana Bread I doubled the ingredients so I made two loaves. My house smells amazing and 1 of the best easy banana bread recipe ever.","I\u2019ve made this dozens of times to salvage those bananas we didn\u2019t get to in time. And every time it\u2019s amazing. I add cinnamon and walnuts if I have them bc I like it. I also adjust up or down based on number of banana refugees. It works well in my loaf pan or in cupcake pan with liners. This recipe is adaptable and perfect.","Never had good luck with banana bread in the past. This recipe is good and it's easy!","Is anyone adding the two tablespoons apple cider vinegar as suggested but not in the recipe. I make banana nut bread frequently as my husband likes it and have never seen this before. Always willing to try different ways.","What is cup: 250 ml?","Never made banana bread with soda or cider vinegar... I'm trying the baking soda now...","Excellent. 3\/4 cup sugar is plenty IMO. I might try 1\/2 and 2 sachets of Stevia. When using walnuts....toast them first for better crunch and added flavour. Next time I will add chopped Dates. Another technique is to blend the dates with the eggs. Note dates are sweet so adjust. Tweaking is fun but do it in steps.","This is the best recipe but.... that being said i cut the sugar by 1\/4 cup as i don't have much of a sweet tooth and i added the extra banana and about half way thru baking it started to overflow! the end result was a little mushier than i'd like but for sure the recipe is excellent. next time i will cut back on the banana. oh...and i couldn't resist adding a sprinkle of nutmeg.","I added 1 tsp of cinnamon. Best banana bread ever!","Yummy!! Great recipe. I\u2019ve modiflyed it slightly and swaped the 1 cup sugar for 1\/2 cup Coconut sugar. I also add Chia Seeds and Chocolate Chips.","Ingredients exactly per recipe, using 4 very, very ripe bananas but left out the optional vanilla. Bread is moist and bursting with flavor. It's very good -- but it's not the &quot;best&quot; banana bread I've ever had. I couldn't tell you why except that another recipe I use has yogurt in it and I'm, perhaps, spoiled with the flavors in that one.","This is the classic, basic banana bread recipe that almost everyone has, floating around somewhere. And it is good. But make a simple change in technique, and completely transform the character of the bread. Melt the butter, then add sugar as described. It thickens and almost melts, just as it does when you combine melted butter and sugar in the classic brownie recipe (that almost everyone has lurking in their kitchen). The bread becomes much moister and is delectable, just a smidge shy of being sticky. The bread becomes almost luscious. And using melted butter is much easier than creaming it, and frees you from the hassle of using a mixer. Yes, this way you have a basic one bowl, wooden spoon and spatula recipe. It is nice to be able to mix up the whole recipe without employing electricity. Substitute 1\/4 cup of the flour for an equal amount of good, strong cocoa, and change the character of the bread once more. The cocoa adds complexity and depth. At this point a lot of people stir in a cup of chocolate chips, but I abstain. Excessive, and too much additional sugar. Of course not everyone enjoys a super moist banana bread that is a little heavier, less cakelike, and more intense than the bread produced by the original recipe, in which sugar and softened butter are creamed. But if you swing toward the dark, deep and intensely fruity end of the spectrum, you will enjoy this recipe made with melted butter!","Great recipe but I find baking powder works better than baking soda in this case. Baking soda makes it rise too quickly. Maybe it\u2019s a preference","I\u2019ve been making this recipe for a year or so now and I always use 4 bananas when I make it. This makes the best banana bread I\u2019ve ever had and every time I make it, at least one person tells me this is the best banana bread they\u2019ve ever had.","Cooked in a cake pan for one hour 5 min. I think I could of cooked it for one hour a little darker around edges but looks good. Letting it cool","I made the best banana bread yesterday for the first time. I love it ! I used 3 large black bananas &amp; it came out so moist. It wasn't dry at all like other recipes I have tried. It was definitely the BEST banana bread recipe ever ! THANK YOU ! Audrey","I just put this banana bread together and it is baking. I liked the recipe because it was simple and so were the ingredients. I followed it to the letter and until I taste it I will decide if I like baking soda or baking powder better.","Best Banana bread ever!! I have tried about 3 different banana bread recepies and this one is far the best homemade recepie!! The ingredients and directions are very simple and easy to follow! Shout out from AZ.","Try using 1\/2 cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar and bake for one hour. It definitely enhances the color of your finished product and prevents it from being overpoweringly sweet. Otherwise a fantastic recipe! Definitely my go to!","It's a nice and easy recipe. I usually add walnuts and\/or semi-sweet chocolate chips. Last time I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat. Turned out great.","So easy to make and it really is the best banana bread. This one is the only one!","Best banana bread. I added about a tsp of cinnamon. Glad I made a double batch!","This a very simple but great recipe. My banana bread always comes out perfect. Thank you! Everybody loves it every time I make it! I\u2019m considering trying to add a little rum and walnuts next time.","Love this recipe! I usually have to double the quantities as it tends to disappear quickly! This recipe is perfect (with or without walnuts or chocolate chips) but if it is at all possible to improve the melt in your mouth effect try this: wrap your loaf(s) in aluminum foil as soon as it cools down and hide it in your fridge for a couple of days before serving... You'll be surprised at the extreme melt in your mouth taste!","Loved this recipe...I made 2 loaves with my son and it was gone in just a few short hours with a family of 6. I will admit I added dried cranberries and pecans to jazz it up, however this recipe didn't need anything I just like adding variety so the kids get used to many different things!","My family loves this recipe so much I have to make it at least once a week! I do add some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg just for a little kick. This is one of those breads to make and gift to friends and family. They will love you for it!!!!","Love this recipe! I have made it 3 times in the last 3 months!","This recipe is the closest I\u2019ve had to my favorite banana bread in the world, Aunty Sandy\u2019s in Keanae, Maui. The secret is the butter! If only I had some nice, ripe apple bananas! Nice crust on this.","This was the best Banana Bread I've ever made.","Keren Rsepnya , terimaksih atas informasinya, pasti akan saya coba http:\/\/website-de-nature-indonesia.bravesites.com","The best one I've tried. It's amazing when you put extra brown sugar on top to make it more sweet\/cake-like! I've made it for dozens of fellow college students, all love it and rave for more.","It should be pointed out that when baking items for 15 minutes or less, removal of the odd pots &amp; pans is not necessary..... That being said, I personally like pecans added to mine.","This is the best banana bread I have EVER had.","Loved it...but for fewer fat and calories, I used applesauce instead of butter...came out just as light and delicious...I did RUB butter on the top for a little of the flavor...","How many muffins would I get from this recipe What temp and time? Thanks","I love your first instruction! Clearly you know my kitchen, lol! Now, for some baking...","This recipe is super easy to make and absolutely DELISH!!! ????????","I have used this recipe twice and my Banana bread was delightful. Thanks.","Have made banana bread several times using this recipe. I swear by it &amp; always refer others to use it. Easy to follow and turns out perfect everytime. You truly will never need another recipe!!! Thank you so much!","Super yummy and easy to make??","Best Banana Bread recipe I have used. I made muffins from this recipe and added coconut and chocolate chips.....they were a big hit.","It's true! I will never need another recipe! Delicious and simple.","Wow! Excellent! I added dried tart cherries and walnuts. Yummy quick loaf bread for fall or anytime!","The best banana bread ever! I am making this banana bread every time and everyone loves it. Thank you for the great and keeper recipe!","I have made more complicated banana bread recipes, but this one is the easiest and best. The only thing I change is to add a few pecans ( if I have them handy ) and a shake or two of nutmeg. Delicious and moist every time !","I have used this recipe so many times. It\u2019s a major hit and is very forgiving. You can give or take on the quantity of some of the ingredients. I almost always go for 4 instead of 3 bananas because it does make it extra moist. Note that the extra banana can also make it seem like it\u2019s not cooked through so don\u2019t get caught off guard. Sometimes I need to go over the suggested time in the oven until the toothpick comes out a little cleaner (an extra 5-7 minutes). I like adding a quarter cup of chopped pecans or walnuts into the batter before baking. I\u2019ve made these as muffins and mini-loaves before but maybe my time is off - it\u2019s definitely not as moist in the smaller sizes. The full-sized loaf comes out right every time.","This really is the best banana bread ever! I always go for the four bananas, and add about 5 or more minutes to bake. I have usually make this when I see our banana getting those little dark spots on them. It tastes even better when the banana are extra ripe.","Excellent, super easy recipe. I enjoy a little hint of salt in my sweets so so added a full teaspoon. Additionally, I made this recipe into mini muffins. 24 cup pan for 15 minutes. Made 45 total mini muffins. Perfect!","I have made this over and over?? It really its the best!My son does not like bananas AT ALL..after few times i made it he tried it,&amp; now its every week:&quot;when are u gonna make banana bread??? Great recipe,i did added chopped pecans Delicious!","I have tried M-A-N-Y banana bread recipes and thought I'd already found the best.....THIS is so much better than ANY other recipe I've ever tried. I made it for a get-together and I don't think I'll ever be allowed to make anything else for this group of friends. I'll forever be known as the banana bread girl because this was so amazing! I made it with four bananas....make it with four!","This really is the best. Very moist and very easy to make. I add the vanilla. Sweet recipe! Five stars!","BEST BANANA BREAD! Amazingly moist and the consistency fine. I cut the sugar down to half a cup and added pecans and chocolate chips.","You had me at, remove odd pots and pans from oven. Good solid recipe, very moist and delicious.","I had bananas in the freezer that had turned. They slid right out of the peel when thawed and were very seeet. The best banana bread I have ever made! I used the 4 bananas and vanilla as per the recipe.","The consistency, colour and appearance were perfect. I have never given a recipe a 1 star review. Until today. The flavour - what an awful aftertaste!! A full can of Pepsi couldn\u2019t even wash it away - salty and bitter, really weird. Not sure why either - nothing in the recipe gives that flavour... terrible. Sorry :\u2019( ended up binning the whole lot after one bite...","Favorite recipe for work coworkers or just my boyfriend. Everyone eats this so fast, I can sometimes not manage to save myself a piece! I only put in 2\/3 cup sugar, and also add in 1\/4 cup chocolate chips, and 2 tablespoons of chia seeds. The chia seeds are completely hidden, which is nice. Add them in there for their micronutrients. SUPER moist. I do 4 bananas. Best variation I have ever made.","This really is the best banana recipe I have ever had--well, with just a few changes: I didn\u2019t use as much sugar-I only used 5\/8 cup sugar, and it was plenty sweet-I generally find most sweet items in the US to be too sweet. I replaced the sugar with 3\/8 cup cashew milk because sugar is a liquid in baking. I also added about 2\/3 cup chopped hazel nuts, 1\/3 cup ground hazel nuts and &frac12; cup toasted dried coconut (small grate). I changed out the soda for baking powder because I thought it would rise better. I made 6 large MUFFINS instead of a loaf, and I think they were the best banana muffins I have ever had. Let cool a full 5 minutes before taking out of the muffin pan and they are beautiful!","This is the best bannana bread I have ever made. Love it. The kids also like it when we make muffins out of it. 23 minutes and they come out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe","Delicious banana bread! I added chocolate chips and pecans. Yom!","Delicious, it cooked for 32 minutes 350 it was great I cut a banana I placed in the bottom after cooked \u2018\u2018twas so delicious","Made it exactly as recipe called for. Family loved it. Best banana bread!!!","One of the best banana bread recipes we\u2019ve ever used. Loved it!!!","Easy and delicious! I did add the extra banana and followed everything else as written! Our new go-to.","Wow, I'm impressed! It's super soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of moisture. I used brown sugar and raisins, by the way. It's really the perfect banana bread!","This was the same recipe my great grandmother used. I used salted butter and omitted the salt, self rising flour, vanilla, walnuts, chopped pecans, half white half brown sugar and 8 bananas for a double batch. It made 3 good sized loaves. One for now, one for later and one for the office in the morning","came out perfect, I left out the vanilla since the price has skyrocketed here, and it was better...all nice banana flavor. I sprayed the pan with Pam.","Great banana bread recipe! Thanks for sharing!","Hands down the best Banana bread ever! . My advice is to NOT change a thing in this recipe, it is perfectly delicious as is! I will be making a few loafs for the upcoming holidays. Also Don\u2019t forget.... after the loaf of bread is room temperature, wrap It in foil and plastic wrap and freeze it. When ready to use, remove the foil and plastic wrap and cut the bread in slices (while still frozen) This keeps the bread from crumbling!","I added bluebeeries and the walnuts, was the most moist bread ever.","I made the banana bread recipe for a function at work. Everyone loved it! I did add 3 tablespoons of all natural applesauce and it was very moist. I was asked by several people for the recipe. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","i just made 4 mini loafs and 3 small loafs with this recipe and it is amazing!! so glad i chose this one. I did add 3 1\/2 bananas!","This is the BEST banana bread I have ever made. It says to use four bananas for a more moist bread. I only had three, so I added approximately 3 tablespoons of sour cream. A maz ing!!!","Absolutely amazing recipe made just as written. The only thing I did was add pecans into it. Thank you so much this is my second loaf I making right now in the last four days. KUDOS!","I only had 2 bananas so added 1\/4 cup of applesauce. Also experimented by adding some previously frozen dark cherries and some chocolate chips. AMAZING","I've tried many different banana bread recipes...this is by far the BEST! I sprinkled walnuts on top the batter and then baked...amazing! There's never any leftovers.","Love this recipe because it's SUPER EASY!!!","Made this before and great! I add a streusel topping to mine before baking ?? Have loaf in oven as we speak!","I\u2019ve made this banana bread many times and it is absolutely delicious. The only change I make is to add some coconut to it. It adds moisture and a hint of \u201cwhat is that taste?\u201d. One of my friends claims he\u2019s a connoisseur of banana bread and said this was the best he\u2019d ever had.","I love this recipe. It's very easy. I tried it the 1st time with 4 bananas but it didn't bake all the way through, even with extra time. The flavor was awesome but gooey. The next time I tried it with the 3 bananas and it's perfect. I also doubled the vanilla extract. Took a loaf to the office and it was gone in seconds. This is a great recipe and will use often.","I made this last week for my granddaughters and they absolutely loved it. They wanted to eat it for breakfast, school snack and dessert. It is the best banana bread recipe.","I made this and added pecans and used a teaspoon of vanilla. This is my favorite banana bread. The best when warm.","So amazing! This perfectly yielded 12 banana muffins! I used brown sugar in place of granulated and I probably would melt the butter next time. But 10\/10! Very delicious and very very moist!","Delicious exactly as written... no tweaking needed! I followed this recipe exactly (including the optional 4th banana and vanilla extract) and it came out perfect! I did have to cook it about 15-20 minutes extra (maybe because of the extra banana?), but it really is the best banana bread I\u2019ve ever had! I\u2019m giving it to my grandma tomorrow and I know she will love it!","Oh my goodness is this ever good! So easy to make, too. I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 tsp vanilla and added 1\/4 tsp cinnamon. Super delish thank you for this awesome recipe!","Wonderful Banana Bread! I've made it several times since I read the recipe and the reviews are always the greatest!","My kids said this was the BEST banana bread I've ever baked! It was delicious and it didn't last long :) I did use the optional 4th banana and vanilla extract and I also used a tsp of cinnamon. This is a keep! :)","I made this recipe today however I did some minor tweeking. I omitted the vanilla, added 1\/8 tsp. Cinnamon and added some grated orange zest to it. The results are amazing!! Moist tasty mini banana breads and the orange zest was the perfect touch. Thanks for the recipe!","Very yummy. I added a little cinnamon to it as another reviewer suggested.

Almost like the ones they sell at local bakeries on the islands! The color wasn't as dark as I wanted it but the texture was fantastic--very soft and fluffy! The magic, however, is in the frosting! If you make this cake, you simply MUST make the frosting to go with it! For someone like me who normally scoops frosting OFF cakes, I was practically licking my plate! To make it though, was a bit daunting. On the first attempt, my frosting came out too lumpy. On the 2nd try, I revised it by adding the powdered cocoa and 1\/2 c. water mixture into the buttery liquid first (after step 16). Then with the remaining cornstarch, I scooped about 2-3 spoonfuls into a small seperate bowl and mixed it with the some of the simmering sauce from the stove. Stirred it til silky smooth and poured it back into the simmering pot to thicken it, mixing it once again. Repeat this several times, while keeping the bubbling mix on low heat and contantly stirring. I did have to add a bit of water from time to time to keep it from thickening too much, but I recommend you do so by instinct. The frosting should be almost like a pudding texture; maybe a little thinner. When done, you'll have to work quickly to frost the cake but your knife will just glide on the cake and the end result is just fabulous! I only frosted the top of my cake but baked it in a 9X13 inch pan. Will make this again and again for sure! Mahalo, Laniakea! **Recommended for all those who want a piece of aloha(love)!**","This is the first time I've incorporated anything into beaten egg whites so this was new territory for me.  I thought the cake would be the difficult part, but it turned out lovely.  The tricky part as lemonlylime pointed out is the frosting.  I was in a hurry and tried to make it quickly and ended up with starch lumps.  I didn't spend enough time mixing the cocoa, cornstarch and water together and kind of sloshed it in the bubbling pot while trying to stir with the other hand.  In a burst of inspiration I thought i could smooth out the lumps in my blender. Those of you who know better are probably falling off your chairs, but I was in a rush and desperate.  It didn't work, so don't try it.  After a few spins and sitting out for a spell it looked liked something I imagine you might find in a macbeth cauldron- so it ended up in the trash.  I tried a second time and thoroughly mixed the cocoa, starch and water together and was a bit more coordinated when combining it with the bubbling solution in the pot.  It turned out better, but the were a few lumps.  You have to be careful about the how fast you let it come to a boil, I think.  I fathom it's like making gravy, but I have never made gravy so this is only a guess. End result: Positive.  I received the Hawaiian seal of approval from hubby... Trickier to execute than anticipated.  Next time I will try lemonlylime's suggestions.","Please be advised. No cream and cornstarch doesn't make the Dobash frosting from the good old days. look up Ganache frosting instead it's closer to the rich frosting from back in the day.Lihia Baker's and HECO's recipes are the same disappointing result.

After browning the onions and meat 2 cups of cooked black beans along with the remaining ingredients were placed in a slow cooker.  After cooking all day on low the meat was very tender.  The chili is well seasoned and a winner for me.  Thanks much for posting.","Flavor is incredible!

May be even better the second day.","This is very similar to a recipe I have called &quot;Cuban Beans.&quot; I used previously cooked pork, so didn't get the brown fond from browning the pork, but it was still very good. I think I would skip the vinegar. My Cuban Beans recipe also calls for it, and one time that I made it I forgot to put in the vinegar, and I liked it better. You be the judge. I would have liked this recipe better if there was more of the delicious broth. I think I would cut back on the beans to get there (maybe by half?) I think it would be good if the broth were thickened a bit as well. I'm not sure what thickener would be good. You wouldn't want to mash the beans or add anything that would make the broth creamy looking, because part of the appeal of this dish is the clear and bright colors of the peppers and tomato broth.

Not having muffin pans, I just bake them on a cookie sheet. I love them!!! We drank a Sangiovese Di Toscana (local wine in Italy) and had polenta with the sauce. Windyday, living in Italy","Very, very nice!  I did end up making quite a few changes in the recipe as I went along, but the end result was a very nice dinner.  I had some leftover fresh salmon, so flaked & used that.  I didn't have any parsley (that would've been a nice touch - next time I'll make sure to have some on hand).  I decided to go with the White Worchester Sauce for no particular reason.   Halving the sauce recipe made plenty & I did double the lemon juice.  This was an easy, tasty meal which I will surely make again.  Thanks, Sean!","Yum! Only changes I made were using the zest of the lemon as well for a bit of extra zing and I quite like the bones and skin in in canned salmon so skipped removing them. It went wonderfully served with some salad.","A quick dish and it's nice not having to stand over a hot stove, so oven-baked got my attention here.  I did make a few changes....my family likes lots of flavor so I used one whole chopped onion and 3 TBLS Worcestershire. Turned out great!! Now for the yummy Lemon Sauce...not having any lemon juice in the house, I used 1 1\/2 tsp lemon extract. The lemon and cayenne are a wonderful tasting duo! I caught myself tasting and re-tasting it!!  \r\n\r\nI'll be fixing this again. \r\nThank you Sean!!","I fixed this for dinner and they just loved it.  Said I could serve this up for them anytime.  I also added just a bit more lemon to the sauce, and it was so good.  I plan to try the remainder of the sauce over some fresh shrimp now, too.  Thanks for sharing this easy and good dish!","This is the best salmon pattie recipe I have ever eaten, and I have eaten a lot of them. I left out the worcestershire sauce and parsley, simply because we don't care for them. I added some onion. I also used multi wheat crackers, because I was out of bread. I will make this again and again. A good way to get your omega 3. I will also double the sauce next time. Very easy to make, I had everything on hand.","This was a recipe at the get go that I was not prepared for in terms of temperature outside vs. indoor airconditioning.  I made it  and had to turn on the oven. Maybe a bit hot, but I didn't notice.   It turned out fantastically.  I would have liked maybe a little less moisture in the final product, but quite tasty.  Many people make mention of what they would do or had to succumb to doing..... me being one of those people.   I always have lemons at my disposal, for cooking, at this time, only limes....oh well.  My darling hubby says he would not have it any other way.  Not sure whether he means it, or just loves me for cooking for him.  I plan on sharing this recipe with others, so nice to prepare salmon in a way that does not require constant attention as it is cooking.  Thanks so much!  Laura","I made this last night. I crushed the bones in the salmon. The bones in the salmon are good and good for you. I used seasoned bread crumbs so did not use salt and 1\/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce. I did not use the salt in the sauce either, the butter was salted.This would be a very good recipe for OAMC. You couldn't make the sauce ahead though.If you didn't want the patties as moist cut back on the milk.Thanks for posting.\r\nOh, I loved the cayenne pepper in the sauce. Just the perfect seasoning!","I am trying to eat more fish and thought this would be a nice change from fillets.  It was nice, but not a hit with the kids or DH.  I thought the lemon sauce was a bit too salty and a bit not-lemony enough.  I liked putting the patties in muffin cups, because as they baked I also baked rolls.","I whipped this little number up for dinner tonight and we like it.  I used home-made bread crumbs (saved peices of home-made whole wheat bread, toasted and ground into crumbs) and 1 can of salmon with bones, another without.  I didn't have any parsley so I had to skip it.It was easy to put together.  It started browning by 30 min so you may want to watch the time.  The sauce is really yummy!  I put about 2x the amount of lemon juice... we like things really lemmony.  I just reduced the amount of milk by a couple of tablespoons and it came out creamy and perfect.  It is quite spicy so I may cut the amount of cyanne in half.  This time I added 1 tsp of sugar to help mild it.  My husband just came it and tried a bite... He likes it... and that is saying a lot!","We love this recipe!  We usually grill twice as much salmon planning to have salmon patties night 2.  I make the following alterations:  I use green onions, add 1\/2 of a jalepeno minced,  and use crushed crackers instead of bread crmbs.  Last night I used low fat wheat crackers, the generic kind from walmart.  We love the sauce!!!","I love this Lemony Sauce. I used it on top of Salmon Patties # 16911 (since that recipe is the way my mom makes her salmon patties) I did what one of the other reviewer said and put less milk in and more lemon juice. I used 1 1\/4 cup milk and 3 TB lemon juice. I also used the sauce on the vegetables that we served with the salmon patties. It was great. I'll use the lemony sauce again. Thank you","I had a playgroup scheduled for the local playground with just snacks, but weather changed our plans and we had to take it indoors. So, it was the night before and I wanted to make a lunch item but couldn't run to the store for anything. This recipe was great. I love that I could make several patties without frying! The patties pretty much tasted like the ones I make and fry, but the sauce was awesome! I added more lemon juice as I love lemon. I kind of wish I'd added a little less cayenne, however...it was super tasty but a little spicy for my personal taste. Husband loved it and didn't think it was spicy at all. I put the sauce in a bowl and everyone spooned it to use as dip for the patties. Much loved!","Baked rather than fried -- what a great idea!  I added a little chopped celery along with the onion since I'm used to patties that way.   For the sauce I used chicken broth instead of milk in the white sauce.  Very Tasty!!","Absolutely excellent, easy and fun to adjust.  Very forgiving and great taste.  I used fresh tarragon from the yard and added about twice as much lemon and pepper. What a great way to serve salmon without having to stand over the stove.  Thank you!","Delicious!!! This is one of the only salmon patty recipes that I could find that isn't fried.  Highly recommended.","Talk about good, these are it!  I did add a little more lemon to the sauce because I love it so much.  What a great addition!  I plan to make these again and again!","Best salmon patty recipe I've ever made. Instead of baking, for a faster way,  I fried in olive oil;  needed only about 1\/2 cup of milk.

Anyways, I would personally avoid these bars at all costs.","These are so simple to make and so INCREDIBLY yummy!!  I did not have problems with the \"setting up\" either but as as a precaution, I did add a tablespoon or so of butter into the Karo syrup\/sugar mix.  I also had just over a cup of peanut butter left in the jar so I used more than one cup, which made it more creamy in the end.  My kids LOVE it and will be added to my favorites!!","I had no trouble with these at all.

I made a few personal tweaks with ingredients (I like to use PB & Co cinnamon raisin swirl peanut butter and add about 1 c. raisins to the bars), but I think people who are having trouble with the bars getting hard are maybe cooking the syrup and sugar for too long\/bringing it to too high of a temperature?  I stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved and it just starts to bubble when I stop stirring for a few seconds, turn the heat off, add the peanut butter and stir until it's mostly melted, then take the pan off the hot burner to stir in the cereal and any other mix-ins I'm using.

Fold the other half of the plastic over the top of the dough and roll out thinly.  Place the resulting \"sandwich\" of dough inside plastic wrap on a cookie sheet and put in freezer until firm.

I never made homemade sugar cookies on my own before, and when I was little, I only remember helping to decorate them.  I've made them from premade dough, but never homemade and this recipe was so good, just the right amount of everything.  However, I did change a couple things - no almond extract so doubled the vanilla.  I replaced whole egg with Eggbeaters and used Smart Balance with Flaxseed Oil for the margarine.  I didn't ice them, I stuck red hot cinnamon candies in the cookies before baking.  They took about 9 mins.

I usually have a problem with the cookie spreading and the cut out design disappearing but these didn't. they are very light and crisp, almost melt before you get them to the mouth...didn't think I could decorate but don't need to, the taste is fantastic. thanks for a great recipe.","Like other folks, I was unsure about the almond extract but it ended up adding a nice depth to the flavor. I let mine stay in the fridge overnight and made sure my rolling surface had a good amount of flour on it and then I didn't have any problems.  I did have to make sure I cooked them for the minimum time or they started to burn a bit but that isn't uncommon with a gas stove.\n\nI also used this as a base to do a chocolate version where I left out the almond and added some unsweetened cocoa powder.","these were tasty, but the dough was very sticky and hard to cut out. had to roll it out in very small portions and cut it as quickly as possible. kept the bowl of dough in the fridge while i was cutting the others. went through a lot of flour during the rolling\/cutting process.\r\ntasted great, though. perfect for decorating because they're not too sweet.","First let me say that I dread rolling dough whether it be for cookies or for pie, it is just not my favorite thing to do.  Based on that  I did add a bit more four based on another review.  However, I found it easy enough to work with and I didn't leave it in the fridge more than an hour or so because I was in a hurry.  I used a small amount at a time and they turned out great!  I didn't use the icing instructions provided with this recipe.  Next tiem I will increase the almond extract because I love it.","Very good cookie! I used a different frosting recipe for it though. BUT the cookies i did not frost were EXCELLENT.","Mmmm these are my absolute favorite cookies! Same recipe we've been using for years and never found one better! Although we do things a little different after the mixing part. We don't refrigerate the dough and have never had a problem with that. Also we cook at 300 degrees for 8 minutes. And we put color sugar (food coloring mixed with sugar) sprinkle on shaped cookies before placing on cookie sheet.","Great cookie!!!  It will be my only sugar cookie from now on.  I was a little worried at first because the dough was VERY sticky.  I had used a spreadable butter instead of margarine, but  I used plenty of flour when rolling them out, and they came out perfect.  I used just a regular buttercream for decorating and they were so delicious.","These cookies were very tasty and easy to make. I rolled them into balls and flattened them with a glass to make round cookies which I then frosted with royal icing and decorated to look like baseballs (they were for a little league team), HUGE HIT!!! Thanks this one is a keeper for sure!!!","I gave this 5 stars even though my dough came out too dry! I added a couple tablespoons of milk and it it turned out fantastic! The dough rolled well and tasted great. The cookies cooked great and the kids loved them, so did I!","Cream of Tartar substitute: \n-1 tsp Baking powder = 1\/2 tsp cream of tartar & 1\/4 tsp soda.\n\nSince the recipe calls for both baking soda and cream of tarter, then omit both the baking soda & cream of tartar and just use baking powder.\nOne teaspoon baking powder is equivalent to 1\/4 teaspoon baking soda plus 1\/2 teaspoon cream of tartar.","It tastes nice, but mine came out so weak, I couldn't lift the cut cookies off the counter without destroying them. I let them sit for 3 hours in the fridge, and even a little longer in the freezer, made no difference. I think it's the powdered sugar. Might try again with granulated.","This has been my favorite recipe for sugar cookies since 1973 when a friend shared the recipe from the Betty Crocker cookbook.  Very tender and delicious!

I've made them both ways, either all brown sugar or 3oz Brown sugar and 3oz GS.  I have found that cooking them for 45 minutes at 150C or 300F makes them stick together more.

But, as a recipe for flapjack, I found it disappointing. (FYI, I followed Babs' recommendation to bake it for 45 minutes at 300 degrees, and Pat's recommendation to use half golden syrup and half brown sugar, which might have made a difference.) I think the ratio of oats to syrup is way off, because mine turned out more like a gooey candy with some oats in it. If I could change the texture of this recipe and keep the flavor, I think it would be a winner; so, I might try it again with 12 or even 16 oz oats, and see if that helps turn it into a syrupy oat bar rather than a soft oat-studded toffee.","Great gluten free recipe only had 3 oz brown sugar so used granulated sugar too."],"vegetarian":"Y","pescetarian":"Y","vegan":"N","lactose intolerant":"N","gluten free":"Y","peanut allergy":"Y","kosher":"Y","halal":"N"},{"id":3065,"name":"crispy baked orange roughy","minutes":16,"ingredient_ids":[5070,2499,2404,5180,4288,4262,3184],"ingredients":["orange roughy","egg","dry breadcrumbs","parmesan cheese","lemon, rind of","lemon pepper","garlic"],"steps":["cut fish into serving-size pieces","beat egg in small shallow bowl","combine remaining ingredients in second shallow bowl","dip fish into egg and then into crumb mixture , coating completely","place on foil-lined baking sheet tucking tail under if needed","bake at 450 degrees f oven for 6-8 minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork"],"description":null,"calorie_level":1,"avg_rating":4.5,"review":["Although this is a basic baked fish recipe, I found it to be quite yummy.

I made some for an adult party and they had a blast with them. I then made another batch and grossed out the local kids with them","Soooo gross!  I love it!  A friend and I made these for her Halloween party.  If you do not THOROUGHLY cool them, they will be two-toned.  Takes some time to make, but worth it.  Very high \"gross-out\" factor!  ;)  Thanx for shring!","These look so gross but taste so yummy and are such a great idea!!\r\nThanks for sharing Linda! =)","I brought this to work on Halloween. Great recipe. Really easy!!!  ","I think I may have messed up the recipe, I didn't add the whipping cream.  It tasted good but was tons of work.  I probably won't make it again, nice idea though.","OMG! These were so disgusting. I hate worms so I could not bear to try more than half of one before I grossed myself out. LOL  My adughter (7) would not even venture to try them and my son (7) loved them! Flavor was awesome.  Just a really creepy gag treat. All the kids either said \"cool\" or \"gross\". What a hit!","These were fun for a teenage Halloween party we had this past weekend.  The kids thought they were so cool when they grabbed a few at a time and let them dangle from their black painted, vampire teeth filled, fake blood dripping down their chin, mouths.  They were fun.  I did have a little bit of a problem getting them out of the straws, but not enough that some patience and care didn't resolve the issue of removing them.  Thanks for a fun recipe for our party.","Totally awesome!  Tough to get out of the straws, but definitely worth the effort!  Great effect, great taste!","Great idea, I was so excited but they did not work for me. My worms were only about 1 inch long, all the jello snuck out the bottom of the straws. How did you all make them, that the jello didn't sneek out??","This was a really easy recipe.  To get all the \"worms\" out quickly, I put the ends of two straws between my teeth and pushed with my fingers.  This made the process go by much quicker.  \r\nAlso, instead of laying them out separately to finish setting up, I piled them all in a bowl to set up together and this formed a brain.  It was quite a hit!","These were great! I saw that someone else had a problem with the liquid running out of the end of the straw.. I had this problem too, but the container I used was too big.. I wound up dumping it all into the original container and trying again with something that was tall and lean, so the straws were snug in the container. So if your container is too big, it runs right back out.. There was definitely jello on the insides of that container, but it also stayed in the straws..  I thought had plenty of raspberry jello, but only had 1 container, so I used a blue berry to go with.. By the time I got the green food coloring mixed in, my worms were grey.. Which was still ok.. They were a big hit! Thanks!","These were the biggest hit! I made them for my kids Halloween sleepover, but me, hubby, and hubby's friend were eating them before the worms were even set out! :oD  I thought they were well worth the time to make them.  I used a tall, round straw holder to set the straws in to fill with the Jello mixture, PERFECT!  \r\nMMMSweets...I thought yours were intentional when I saw your picture.  My first thought was \"Cool,  someone made maggots instead of worms.  I have to add that one with the worms next year!\"  So thanks to you I have another dish to set out next Halloween! lol","These were great - they looked very real!  I wasn't crazy about the flavor, but I might try different flavors of jello next time and compensate with food coloring.  The effect was more important anyway.  I served the worms in a glass serving dish mixed with crushed chocolate graham crackers and crushed oreos for dirt.  Awesome!","Additional tips:  a one liter plastic drink container with the top cut off works great.  Make sure you put the straws in the container upside down.  Allow enough time to \"squirt\" the worms out of the straws and ask for help!  Otherwise this is a VERY COOL affect--parents are grossed out and the kids think it is cool!","These really did look real! The 2-4 year olds would not touch them, but my 7 and 9 year old loved eating them! Make sure to fill up bending straws with the flexible side down. You want the ridges in the worms. Takes quite a bit of time getting all of the worms out-30-40 minutes. This was a small portion for a big party- next time I'll make two hundred!","What fun!  I agree they're a bit messy to make but hey, Halloween comes but once a year.  My 72-year-old husband walked by and said \"YUK!  they look like sea worms and I'm not having any\", the other kids in the house howled when they saw them.  Taste isn't bad, either.  TFS!","This has to be a five star recipe simply due to the special affects.  Taste is okay.  Kids love how they look.  They even feel like real worms.  It is really time consuming getting the \"worms\" out of the straws, but worth it to see the kids faces.","I thought these were fantastic.   My husband thinks I'm crazy.  I made them for girls preschool halloween party.  One classroom gobbled them up.  Only 2 kids from the other class would eat them.  I think it might have been the presentation.  They really looked like actual worms.   I used a square milk carton and got about 250 worms.  They were 3\" to 4\" long each.  Next time I think I'm going to put a layer of paper towel in the bottom of the carton to try and decrease the excess flow from the bottom of the straws.    As another reviewer suggested I crushed up chocolate teddy grahams for dirt and mixed it with the worms in little bowls.    Thanks!","I found a fast and easy way to get the worms out of the straws using needle-nose pliers. First I tried squeezing the open end of the straw with the pliers but it was too slippery. Then I tried grabbing the straw with one nose of the pliers inside the straw and the other nose outside. That did the trick. With my new solid grip I was able to squeeze the worms out quickly and easily...they practically slid out! It should only take you a few seconds for each straw. The worms really complemented my Qwiggle Halloween Jello molds (I have the hand, brain and eyeballs). Check out Qwiggle Jello molds online, they look so real it's scary. I love my gruesome but tasty treats for Halloween!","My daughter and I had great time making these.  They came out a bit darker because in australia our packaging is different and it was hard to get correct conversions.  The kids loved them.","ooooh wee! these were a hit at my son's halloween party. I used a box of green lime and orange, did everything else the same and they were a GREAT green color. I pushed in about 20 more straws and 2 days later pushed all those suckers out with my fingers - that was hard work! LOL About 20 straws after I started I remember I was to rinse them and that made the job much less messy. :-) \nThey will be at the party next year too! Thanks!","What a cool idea!  I love it.  Until it came time to get the worms out of the straws.  Way too time consuming.  I ran out of time and gave up. They look just like real worms though.  May try again next year and start early just because it is so gross - I mean cool!  :)","So sorry that I forgot to review this.  We used this almost 2 years ago! for my daughter's sweet 16 party where we played Fear Factor games.  \nThese really looked real.  We did have a bit of trouble with the first few, but then we found that holding the end of the straw with needle-nosed pliers helped a lot.  Also, be sure to run the worms under hot water long enough.  We were afraid that they would melt, but found that if you do it correctly, they will remove with ease and have a glossy appearance to them.\nThanks for a great gross-out recipe.","These are the coolest, grossest things I've ever made!  They look great, and feel disgustingly real.  My 4 yr old boy loved dangling them over his mouth and slurping them down, my 6 yr old girl took about 10 minutes working up the nerve to try one.  Even when told they were jello, some people wouldnt try them!  My kids took them to school today, and were the hit of their classes!","A HUGE hit with the kids in the neighborhood.  I made a batch this weekend to as a test for Halloween next month. They look so real no one really wanted to eat them.  I used raspberry gelatin and my worms have a nice, realistic pinkish-brown color.  I think it might be fun to make two batches and use grape gelatin for the second batch so there are some light and dark worms in the bowl.  Thank you so much for the GROSSEST recipe EVER!!!!!","These are fantastic!  I made a batch and served some in a bowl and also put some in a recipe #51813.  They were a huge hit.   The kids AND the adults all liked them!","They have a Halloween themed Birthday party for one of our officers every year.  Last year I made these along with the severed finger cookies.  They were a huge hit.... which means everyone was somewhat grossed out!!!  They are worth the effort!","These were a big hit at my ladies get together and fun to make!","A lot of fun to make, they do look so real. Just a tip for the next person, make sure the flexible part of the straw is facing down in the carton. My son loved them.","This is a great recipe.The worms look real and they taste good too.I like to use the raspberry flavor jello.","I love this recipe! I will make it again next year, but with red jello (had orange already) and a taller container. I used a rolling pin to get the worms out of the straws and it worked perfectly. Make sure to use a narrow and tall container!","I made these for my daughter's halloween party and they were a hit! My bowl full of worms was the star of the table and they were eaten up quickly! The kids and adults loved them. It was a little time consuming, but worth the effort.","What a great Halloween \"treat\"! My nephew and his friends loved these (the way they looked as well as how they tasted). I'll be making these again next year. Thanks Linda!!","These were great!  My kids were grossed out, but my daughter loved the taste!  (My son wouldn't try them)  It took some time to get the worms out of the straws, but otherwise it was pretty easy.  It was a perfect addition to our halloween party this year!  Thanks.","Fun Fun Fun!   Very gross looking, but they tasted good.  I had some trouble at first getting them out of the straw but once I got the hang of it it worked out.  Thank you for sharing.","Amazing, they really look like worms! Kinda gross! But really neat!\nI didn't have whipping cream so I substituted cool whip with a little powdered sugar to thicken the cool whip. They still turned out! I also put a little crushed up graham cracker to look like dirt.\nThanks for the brilliant idea! \n\nNote: It is best to hold straws underwater for only about 4 seconds. This allows the worms come out smoothly yet they are not turning into mush from too much heat!","The flexible straws give the worms realistic ridges and their color is perfect.","This was perfect and an enormous hit at the 5th grade Halloween party today! All the kids freaked out, and all the moms wanted the recipe. The only trouble I had was getting them out of the straws. I ran them under hot water for 4 seconds, but the water was too hot and turned the jello to goo, so I did 2 seconds on lukewarm water. My husband grabbed one end of the straw with pliers and used his thumb to press out the jello. The rolling pin did not work at all for us.","They turned out great and taste pretty good too. The only thing that I'll do different next time is not use dollar store straws. They split at the ridge area on some of them.","I have not even tried this, but it sounds so grossly wonderful! My granddaughter will LOVE this!<br\/><br\/>I wrote the above in 2006, now, exactly 4 years later I can update my review...wow, what fun! These worms look so real and taste so good! I did not have the jello called for, but I don't think it matters. I used what I had. They were both red jellos and both were sugar free. I added blue food coloring to the jello mix to make it more purple, then I added enough green to the whipping cream to balance the color. I tried the rolling pin method, but the worms were too uniform when they came out. I also found it a bit awkward. The finger method worked best for me, until I remembered that I had a small surgical clamp. I clamped it onto the end, which left both fingers free to squeeze out the worm and direct it into the bowl. I am excited to see my goblins tomorrow night! Thanks again for this wonderful share!","Fun! Fun! Fun! It was well worth the work.  My only disappointment was the amount of waste involved.  All of the worms stuck together in the bowl after being loosened from the straws so I think next time I will spray them all with a little non-stick spray.  Definitely a keeper for the shock value!","I've been making these for years (they originally came from Sunset magazine.) A friend helps me get them out of the straws because I now have problems with my hands. He's a very adventurous eater and knows exactly what's in them, but he is freaked out by how realistic they are and won't even try one. We serve them as part of Mud, Dirt and Worms every Halloween--I layer chocolate pudding with lots of oreo crumbs in a plastic flower pot used only for this recipe, then chill for several hours and garnish with the worms.","I was really excited to make this recipe for my son's 2nd grade class.  It was a flop and I had to go to a back-up plan.  The Jell-O mixture wouldn't stay in the straws even after I tried foil and a bag rubber-banded to the straws.  Then I tried cooling the mixture a little more...only to find it sat on TOP of the straws! I ended up just leaving it in the bowl and calling it chopped liver.<br\/><br\/>How in the world did you all manage to keep the Jell-O in the straws????? Not going to try again until someone reveals their secret!","How do you keep the liquid inside the straws.  There is no way they fill up, everything goes out from the bottom.  Please tell me what I should do to be able to fill the straws.  thank you.","Why is the whip cream needed in the recipe?","These worked out perfectly! I followed the directions but used strawberry jello. My biggest tip is to purchase the tall whipping cream container so you will have a snug fit around your straws. I used a cup but I had alot of waste around the worms (still edible) which made my straws fill up 3\/4 of the way. I saw people asking how to get it to stay in the straws, it's a tall snug container that does it.","The best way to keep the jello in the straws is to fill them 1\/4 of the way, put in freezer 20 minutes, then fill up the rest of the way.","hehe... so I was having the same problem as others, getting the liquid to stay in the straws.

LOL  We really enjoyed it, although I had no toasted almonds, so I didnt use any, but it was wonderful!  Thanks for a great dessert!","Super delicious!! This is a recipe I will use often!! ","This was an easy recipe to prepare.  The result was a very sticky, gooey, sweet treat.  By the way, 1 can of condensed milk equals 1 cup. I made a second time , heating the condensed milk in the microwave to help it spread more evenly and I used shredded, sweetened coconut instead of the almond joys.  I did everything else the same, except bake in a 15 x 10 pan for 25 minutes.  I drizzled some milk chocolate over the top.  I think that the original recipe has the better taste, because you just can't duplicate the Almond Joy's, but heating the milk definitly helped the second batch, as did the larger pan.

I used Mounds instead of Almond Joy, omitted the sliced almonds and used the whole can (14 oz) of condensed milk.  These took 30 minutes to bake in my oven.  I may never make plain brownies again!

I followed the recipe to a \"T\" and they were so yummy I almost finished off the whole bunch by myself!","I took this to work and it was loved by all, was asked to make another one soon.","This was a huge hit at my house.  Very easy to make and was gone in 2 days.  They are requesting more.","I wasn't sure about the directions because my brownie mix called for 1\/2 cup oil, so I ended up using a couple of T more oil. I think that made them a little too gooey. I made these as part of a brownie platter and honestly they were not my favorite but they were quite good. They were so easy to make and I am sure that had I made them alone they would have not had to struggle to get my favor. I think I will try making them again using DC brownie mix and see what happens. Bt the way, these also freeze quite well.","These brownies are for all almond joy fans.  They are very rich, gooey, and delicious.  I love the way the candy bars melt right into the brownie.  If I was to do anything different, I might try cutting down on the sweetened condensed milk a little.  Thanks for sharing a yummy recipe.","This was an easy recipe to make.  I made two batches for a bake sale.  It was one of the first things to sell out!  I asked a couple of people who bought the brownies what they would rate them (between 1 and 5) and they both said \"4\".  I added the extra star for ease of preparation.  I couldn't find 14 ounce packages of Almond Joy Bars, so I just used the 11.9 ounce packages.  I also didn't measure the condensed milk--I just used 1 14 ounce can for each batch.

It would be a great dinner party dish for an informal night with friends because it has a great presentation and if you get the ingredients laid out beforehand it comes together in a flash. I made a few changes to reflect what I had on hand, but I don't think they affected the dish significantly. I marinated the chicken in a bit of lemon juice, salt and pepper for about 20 minutes. I also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and lightly sauteed spring onions instead of parsley on top. For the breadcrumbs, I made my own using fresh bread, whizzed in a food processor and toasted in the oven. I think the total dish as written here would make quite a lot, maybe enough for 5-8 people depending if you serve with a salad and bread or not. I only had 1 chicken breast (admittedly it was a big one -- 250g) and used 5oz pasta and that was plenty for 2, with pasta left over.","This was really good.  Probably would have been even better if I had remembered to pound the chicken first as the recipe said.  Great as leftovers also.","This is a great recipe Marg, thanks for sharing. I used roast vegetable pasta sauce and fresh buffalo mozzarella rather than the  kind you can shred, so I just cut it into small chunks and added it while the chicken was still in the pan so that it would melt a little.

Had to juggle ingredients a bit as I only used 2 chicken breast.  That did not matter a bit though.  This was wonderful stuff.

I used my own homemade spaghetti sauce for the chicken cutlets, which of course makes it extra special with lots of added flavor.  I made with Garlic Spaghetti instead of plain and had it on the side.  This dish is really tasty and simple to put together.  We enjoyed it!","Really easy and tasty! Even my super-picky fiancee liked it! My only suggestions would be to use more pasta sauce than called for (I like to have sauce to eat with the pasta too), and to make sure you tenderize the heck out of the chicken!","Made this last night and it was fabulous.

I have to agree... it was to die for.","This was very good and extremely easy to put together.  I made it for all the boys for a weeknight meal and it came together in a snap.  Thanks for posting, will surely make again.","I made this for my husband and I and we loved it! When I made it I fried off some onion and sliced musrooms first and added them to the pasta sauce. I am in the UK and used Dolmio and it worked perfectly. Also, we were unable to get italian style breadcrumbs, so I just used Paxo ones, which worked well. I served it with spaggetti. An absolutely delicious meal, that I will definitely be making again really soon.","My husband just loved this dish!  I used whole wheat angel hair pasta.

I used chicken cutlets..already thin-cut-for you..the egg dip and bread crumb coating keeps the cutlets crisp..I added more Italian seasoning to the crumbs and used Paul Newman Marinara  and Ragu Old World Traditional sauce as I like the combination when I don't make my own sauce.  I do use fresh grated Parmigiano  Reggiano cheese and had to have some mozarella which i sprinkled over the chicken beasts while they cooked in the sauce...Will definitely be making again...","Fantastic! My only complaint is that 4 flattened chicken breasts can't fit in a normal sized skillet (or is it just that chicken breasts aren't \"normal\" sized anymore?) \r\nI had a 3lb pack of chicken with 5 breasts in it.

I used Barilla Marinara which is what I had on hand which had chunks of tomatoes in the sauce.

Every time I make these I get rave reviews. Plus, you can substitute the raisins with butterscotch chips for a nice twist.","I omitted the cinnamon,and added a bag of those new cinnamon chips.I also used regular rolled oats instead of the quick cooking kind.The cookies were great!","This is my favorite oatmeal raisin cookie recipe! The cookies are nice and chewy. I underbake them just a bit (when the tops just barely start to get a light golden color, and they are very soft to the touch), when they cool and settle, they'll stay chewy. I have found that using dark brown sugar (instead of light brown) gives them a richer flavor, and adding a 1\/2 tsp. of nutmeg is a nice addition. Great recipe!!","very very nice cookies. i halfed the recipe and added a dash of nutmeg. they were gone by the end of the day and i made them at 6 pm.","This is a classic cookie -- easily mixed all in one bowl and irrestible when they come out of the oven. I added nuts to half of mine, just for a change and that was a nice addition. Particularly liked the cinnamon in them and the slightly crunchy texture.","Crunchy, really crunchy and delicious!","This is a great recipe, my husband loves these cookies!! I'm going to add some chocolate chips next time.","Really great soft oatmeal cookies!  I added nutmeg and 1\/2 c. shredded coconut and they were yummy!  They disappeared quickly; guys seem to really like these cookies!","This recipe was awesome! :) Loving oatmeal but not raisins, I substituted the chocolate chips for the raisins, but added a touch of cinamon. They were dee-lish! \r\n\r\nI baked a dozen and froze the rest of the dough for another day. Thanks!","Excellent cookies!!!!  Highly recommend.","These are awesome! I love baking these for little kids:)","I make this recipe a lot, and these cookies are always loved by anyone who tries one. The only change I make is that I use 2 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon, and I underbake a little because I like them soft & chewy!","These cookies were excellent !! I had the family eating them as soon as they were coming out of the oven. I will try next time making them with chocolate chips. Thanks for sharing :)","Great Recipe.  My hubbys favorite cookie...My son has never liked oatmeal, and guess what!  He asked me to make again and again and again!\r\n\r\nThank you!  I made it exactly as stated!","Everybody in my family sure liked these cookies!  ","I made these cookies today and they are wonderful! I am a \"newbie\" in the kitchen and they still came out great.

Also my other friend who is an oatmeal cookie expert said they were the BEST ones she ever ate!  She wants the recipe!  Excellent!","Oatmeal Raisin is one of my favorite cookies!  This recipe is very good.  The whole family enjoyed these quite a bit!  I didn't have raisins so I used craisin and they tasted just as yummy.

I can't wait to try them with chocolate chips and coconut!!!","Very good cookies. I omitted the cinnamon in the recipe. I added chocolate chips to half the batter and raisins to the other half.

My parents said these were THE best cookies they've ever had...Well, these are the best cookies I've ever had too. Thank you sooooooo much!","I thought these cookies turned out good, but I think next time I will add nuts... and perhaps undercook them as stated by a reviewer above.","the cookie tasted pretty good.  however, i can't figure out why they were so puffy.  i guess i like flatter cookies so i tried to smoosh down the batter a bit when i placed them on the cookie sheet.  it really didn't help much.  ","Good cookies!  They were rather big and chewy and had an \"undercooked\" taste to them but a hit all the same!  I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make again!","Make these cookies all the time! Recipe is from oatmeal can lid. I usually add up to about 1\/2-3\/4 c. more flour, because then I underbake them and the cookies stay really moist! But anyways, this is an AWESOME cookie recipe! MUNCH ON!","This is the recipe that I have always used.  I never wrote it down, just always got it off the Quaker oatmeal box.  I just made a batch this afternoon, and they were as delicious as always!","I have made these twice so far and every time I do, they are gone sooo fast! This is definately a keeper.

I use this when im going to visit with people, the cookies are just so tastey they vanish.

Cookie stays soft for days if you keep them in ziplok bags  ","DH favorite cookies!!\r\nI bake each batch for 15 minutes.  Around here he'd be happy if I made these every week!!","these had a great flavour however i found them a little doughy.  i too undercooked them and they did stay nice and soft.  thanks for the easy, tasty cookie recipe!","Excellent cookies - crisp around the edges with a chewy center.  The amount of cinnamon is just right and I also like that they aren't overly sweet.  Thank you!!!","I have made these cookies for years, just using the recipe off the oatmeal box, so thanks for posting it.  I discovered by chance, that by making the dough in advance, putting it in a zipper bag in the refrigerator, and baking later, that the cookies are even better ... something about the oats getting softer and the flavors distributing better (I think).  They are a hit either way, but this method makes serving \"fresh baked\" cookies a breeze.","Out of this world nummy !!! I ran into a couple problems (my  fault) I was short on margarine, so I used 1\/2 cup margarine and 1\/2 cup  crisco. I got busy mixing this up then realized I had no cinnamon ! sooo I sprinkled a bit of all spice, pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg in to give it some spice flavor of some kind. One thing I did which I do with ANY oatmeal raisin cookie recipe is, I plumped the raisins in hot water then drained them. This makes the raisins softer and juicier. This is a regular cookie recipe for me now!!! Thanks so much.","A classic favorite of my family.  I love using the old fashioned oats instead of quick oats for a chewier cookie.  No rasins in mine tho - not a big fan of them. :-)","These cookies are wonderful!!  I was looking for a simple, delicious oatmeal raisin cookie recipe for my DH.  Boy, have I found it!  I will definitely be making this again and again!","So good!  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1\/2 cups regular flour and omitted raisins (I didn't have any).  All else was kept the same.  Turned out excellent.  I highly recommend!","These were exactly what I was looking for.  I didn't read all 40 ratings, but what I did read, no one mentioned that they were chewy.  That's what we love - CHEWY oatmeal raisin cookies.  I did have to lower my oven to 325 F and they baked for 10 minutes.  They did not spread much so you can load them up on your cookie sheet.  My daughter loved them too so the two of us made another batch the very next day for her to take to her co-op work place.  Great recipe!  Thank you.","Perfect classic recipe.  Why mess with perfection?  I loved it and added it to my cookbook.  I will be making these again as oatmeal raisin are my bf's favorite cookies.","I doubled this recipe and made approx 45 large cookies.  It was wonderful.","I have made these cookies over and over, and they taste just as good every time. I love them chewy, so I always bake them for a couple minutes short of the recommended time. Enjoy, I know my family does!","oh my gosh these are the best! we make them all the time! I they used to be my favorite, but now they are rivaled by my amazing whole wheat oatmeal cookies (can be found in my recipes!)","Love this recipe! They always turn out just perfect for me, thought I leave out the raisins. Thanks for sharing!","Our first snow and I am compelled to bake.  Who knew?  These are soooooo good.  Just in time for Valentine's Day.  They are my husbands favorite.  Thanks!","These cookies are for sure a keeper.  I did use half the butter and 1\/2c. applesauce. I microwaved the raisins and applesauce together for a couple seconds to plump raisins. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!","I don't know why came out pale... So I did the usual mistake - left it for another 1-2 min and then they were a bit too dry for my taste. I think it may be my oven... Which is due to be replaced anywa...","These were great cookies-you can't eat just one, or two, or..... I will surely make this again-no need to try another oatmeal raisin recipe. Thanks for posting!","My dad used to make this recipe when I was younger.  He did it one year for an office Christmas party, and the next year he was told he was bringing his oatmeal cookies ... :D\r\n\r\nOne thing I clearly remember from my childhood is that the recipe used to include 1\/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  I've tried making the recipe without it, and they just don't taste the same.","This is NOT the original recipe. TZhis has been altered, ratios are not the same as on the packet, just as the yield in the original is 36 cookies, not 48. The result was dry, less than expected and very sad. Why would people repost recipes after altering them?","This IS the original recipe. I have the box top from the Quaker Box right in front of me. It matches ingredient for ingredient, amount for amount. These are wonderful cookies! I sometimes add 1\/2 cup chopped nuts to the batter. We love them.","Fantastic! I could eat the whole batch myself. Only sheer will power is stopping me.... for tonight anyway :)","these are great i just finished making them i had been craving some oatmeal cookies for a few days now anyways i have already ate like 6 of them and there are still a little over 4 dozen on the platter thank you will be making again btw i made exactly like the recipe says and they turned out perfect.","This is the recipe I always use for oatmeal cookies - it is the best!","These were great. I made these with cinnamon chips instead of raisins as I was out. A big hit at the office. Thanks for posting!","Very good!","I made the bar form and overbaked them, I let them dry the rest of the way out on a rack and ran them through a food processor.  Turning them into yummy granola :)\nThanks for the nice rec","Made these today, let batter sit in fridge per another review's suggestion..... let come to room temp about 25 min then baked..... absolute perfection... used splenda for baking and also splenda brown sugar blend.  Nuts of choice were pecans... dh rates a 5, said they are just soft enough..i agree.... thanks for the recipe dale...","These are so good. My brother claims that they taste better than the store bought cookies. Thanks.","The perfect cookie!!  I replaced the raisins with chocolate chips,  just to make them a little more healthy.  :)  The chocolate w\/ the hint of cinnamon flavor is awesome.  Thanks for posting a great recipe.","These are really soft and chewy, just the way I like them. I love having raisins in the recipe so next time I think I;ll increase the amount. I made the cookies larger than suggested in the directions resulting in a bit less cookies.","Yummy! I like these cookies a lot, although some instruction about how far apart to space them on the cookie sheet would've been helpful, because mine all ended up stuck together! I was a little sceptical about not greasing my cookie sheets, so I did. They still turned out great.","I run a daycare, and had about 4 parents just rave over these (and the kids liked them too). I must agree they are delicious.I reduced the white sugar by 1\/2c.. with no noticable difference. Thanks","Too dry for my liking. i think Quaker's motivation is to use as many oats as possible.","They were ok. I think they needed to be sweeter. My kids loved them though. So I will make them again cause it is so easy. I will just make them sweeter next time.","Totally yummy! I added chocolate chips and walnuts, the perfect cookie for a cold, rainy day. (I realized I made these ages ago, wrote the review and forgot to add stars, oops.)","Thanks for posting this. I went to make the cookies and it was no longer on the box!!","I thought they were ok, but they werent as great as some of the other recipes I tried on here","I needed to take a snack to the Cardiac Rehab gym for a Christmas party.  I used this recipe and used some of the many great suggestions I found here.  I used half butter and half unsweetened apple sauce.  I then used Spenda\/Sugar Blend and the Brown Sugar\/Spenda blend.  I also tried the suggestion to soak the raisins in hot water and drain to plump them up.  I used Old-Fashion Oats as they have more fiber than the quick.  All-in-all, they came out great.  Thanks for posting the original recipe found at one time on the box.","This is my favorite oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. Easy to do and makes a nice soft, chewy cookie. Thanks for posting.","Awesome Cookies! I made them Vegan! I substituted  Soy Butter, egg replacer, sugar in the raw and I added apple sauce to the existing recipe. Perfect!","These oatmeal cookies are simply the best I've ever made.  I made one simple change....I used chocolate chips, along with the raisins (about 2\/3 cup each).","these are DELISH!","Gone in One day! And now I'm making more. These are just too good.","DH claimed he did not like oatmeal cookies....He said, \"Umm, these are goood!\" I left out the raisins.","The kids loved these. Am always looking for a new cookie recipe that, * clears throat* is HEALTHY for them. As well as one they will actually eat. This one is definately a keeper. I did add some walnuts, currants and coconut to the mix. Other then that followed EXACTLY. THanks so much for posting.. Perfect activity on a stormy wintery day.","really good!","These are so good!  I made a batch of these as mini cookies for my 1 year old & he loves them & I like that they don't use a lot of sugar.","I love these, especially made as bars!  Tonight I halved this recipe and made an 8 by 8 pan with about 1\/2 cup of m and m's I had leftover from valentine's day.  The kids (and me) really enjoyed them!","I made the square version of this recipe and it was very easy and very good.  A new staple in my children's school lunches.  Thanks for posting!","Best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever eaten.","Used  close to 2 cups  fresh ground soft white whole wheat flour , turbano sugar instead of reg. and brown and added a 1\/4 tsp nutmeg.Baked in a  over large pan as bars.\nEnded up falling a part and making the best granola we've ever eaten!\nNext time will use less flour and make as cookies.","I came on to post my comment that there wasn't enough flour called for, but when I checked the ingredient list I found that the recipe calls for 1 and 1\/2 cups of flour--when I printed it out, the 1\/2 cup was missing on my print out, and it makes a *big* difference! So, after making 2 pans of \"granola\" I added some flour and the cookies were great! I think they could use a little more spice (maybe some nutmeg and a little more cinnamon) but I really like the nice chewy texture of these. I can see that chocolate chips would be a great addition. Thanks for this recipe.","I was looking for an oatmeal raisin cookie not realizing that I already had one on my oatmeal box! Anywho, this recipe is absolutely amazing! I've never beena fan of oatmeal cookies, but this one had me coming back for more. I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg simply because I love the spicer taste. Delish! Thanks for posting!","This is good but not as good as Recipe #35813. That's why I gave it 4-stars.","This makes a great bar cookie! I made it for the family and all gave it a thumbs up.

I tried Donna Matthews tip for refrigerating the dough first and they came out beautifully that way.  Thanks so much for posting it.","Made'em for T-giving at the office, got 80 cookies out of it. *Four* returned home. I like to have the butter at room temperature before throwing it in the mixer with the sugars.","A good basic Oatmeal Raisin cookie.","This is how I remember oatmeal cookies and I love this recipe.  If you cook them a little less time they will be soft and chewey.","Enjoyed these as bar cookies as suggested.

I'm so happy that I chose to make these. I cut the recipe in half and subbed Egg Beaters for the eggs. They turned out perfect. Thanks so much for posting!!","I see why they vanish!! The best oatmeal cookies i have ever eaten. I added 1\/4 cup of chocolate chips. Delish!","This is the most AWESOME oatmeal raisin cookie recipe! I usually add 1 tsp. nutmeg to the spices, and I also sometimes use 1 1\/2 cups chocolate chips instead of raisins (sometime I am going to try putting Sun-Maid chocolate-covered raisins in). I bake them for 10 min, and I usually get about 3 dozen, because I like to make them more rustic-looking, so I don't use a cookie scoop and they come out a bit larger. :)","I love these cookies......really good with chocolate chips or M&M's, too.","These cookies were very good. I used half raisins half mini chocolate chips. I cooked mine for 11 minutes and they were very soft. Thanks!","These came out great and I'm not even an oatmeal cookie fan!

Thank you!","I love this recipe. whenever I make poeple ask me how I made them so good. and I say \"duh, its the recipe off the oatmeal box!\"","I was out of butter\/margarine so I substituted canola oil.  These cookies were fabulous!  I used green raisins which are my favorite, and reserved half of the dough to add walnuts to.  This is a easy, wonderful cookie!  Thanks for sharing!","Perfection!  Only change was to substitute 1\/2 cup plumped currents for the raisins.  DH even emptied the crumbs from the cookie jar into a bowl and topped them with vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup.","My family and I really enjoyed these cookies. I didn't have raisins so I left them out, which I actually prefer. Thanks for posting!","excellent! I added coconut and pumpkin seeds to the mixture as well to make more of a \"trail mix\" type cookie. Next time I'll add some chopped dates and maybe some nuts too.","The best!","These are really good!  They are soft & chewy (not cakey) if you follow the baking instructions.  But, hubby likes his cookies crunchy so I baked his cookies for 17 minutes.  I got 5 dozen large cookies from one batch.","These are perfect! This was my first attempt at oatmeal raisin cookies and I won't be looking for another recipe! My husband loves them and says they are better than the bakery that we usually get our oatmeal raisin cookies from. I took a couple suggestions from the other reviews-I soaked my raisins in hot water for 15 minutes to plump them up before using them and I added 1\/4 teaspoon nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.I baked them for 12 minutes which was perfect. Thank you for posting the recipe and thank you to all the helpful reviewers. These are just what I was craving....mmmmmm!","I have been making this recipe for years and still love it...I usually skip the cinnamon and add walnuts and chocolate chips...Yummm!","These cookies turned out wonderfully!  I soaked the raisins in the vanilla and 2 eggs overnite and wow!  Amazing!!!","These are wonderful. I made these and modified them to fit what I had.\nI used salted real butter and subbed 1\/2 tsp almond extract for the vanilla because I was all out.\nAfter I was done mixing, I turned it out onto wax paper and rolled it into a log. Refrigerated over night, cut into slices and baked at 350 for 6 minutes.","I didn&#039;t have raisins, and I never use margarine (butter only) other than that I stuck to the recipe.

DH asks for these everytime.  I always follow the recipe as is.","My sister just had a baby and her husband requested a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies. I had never actually made them and went to Zaar to find one to try. I settled on this one and I am glad I did because they went down so well that I am going to have to make a second batch tonight.","My cookies came out sticky and didn't seem to have enough flour.  I checked the recipe several times as I went along.  Just to be sure(after my cookies came out of the oven to sticky), I checked this recipe with the one on the Quaker Oats web site.  This recipe has 2 more Tablespoons of butter and 1\/4 c. MORE brown sugar than their recipe...which explains exactly why mine aren't turning out like the cookies I remember.  Sorry, but I am a bit disappointed.","Fabulous cookies, and just what I was craving. I love the texture, and they were easy to make. I subbed the margerine. I used 1\/2 cup margerine and 1\/2 cup applesauce. I wonder if they could be made a little spicier, but not brave enough yet to try it lol","Thanks for posting. If you buy a box of quaker oats in Mexico all you get is a recipe for some awful looking cheese\/oatmeal soup. I added a large very ripe banana to half the batch and craisins to the other half. The banana ones were really good.","Have made these classical wonderful cookies several times. They are the perfect balance between sweet and salty. They must be a little bit underbaked to stay moist and chewy. I have tried making them with craisins, although I favor good ole raisins. I tell myself that they are healthy because of the oats and the raisins, right?!","excellent recipe! i had golden raisins & oatmeal to use up and this was the perfect recipe. Easy to make, not to sweet or salty and just flavorful all over. my bf, who's isnt a cookie person, loved this as well. i brought it to work and everyone raved about and wanted me to take more!","Grew up eating these. Wouldn't change a thing!!","These rock.  This was the first thing I wanted to eat after delivering twins...my mom rushed home at around midnight and stayed up making a batch, bless her...they didn't disappoint and, 10 years later, it has remained my go-to oatmeal raisin cookie recipe ever since.","These are everything oatmeal raisin cookies should be! Delicious recipe, definitely making them again soon!","I have been enjoying these cookies since I was a kid! The cookies turned out just as yummy as I remember, and I received lots of compliments on them. I added 1\/4 tsp of nutmeg to the recipe. I also omit the raisins in mine - when I was younger, we were baking these and realized we were out of raisins but we actually enjoyed the raisin-less cookies more! So that's become a bit of a tradition in the family.","The Quaker Oats box recipe has changed a time or two.  This version is ok.  If I use quick oats I do not add the full 3 cups because I find that they absorb more and the cookies turn out a tad on the dry side.  I much prefer the texture of the old fashioned oats anyway.   The recipe I have that my mom got off a Quaker's box when I was little is called \"Quaker's Best Oatmeal Cookies\"  It eliminates one egg as well as 1\/4 of the brown sugar.  it also adds an addition 1\/4 cup of butter.  Everything else is the same.  My SIL uses this recipe, and I use the original quaker's best oatmeal cookie recipe and find that everyone prefers my version.<br\/><br\/>One last tip.  If you just use margarine, they tend to be quite a bit stickier and I have found that they tend to stick together when put in a container.  With butter they tend to be more crispy.  I have found that doing a margarine\/ vegetable shortening combo brings out the best moist chewy, but not sticky texture that both my husband and I like in our cookies.","This is the only recipe I use when making oatmeal raisin cookies.  It's just the best and there is nothing more or less needed to this recipe.  I can whip these up in my stand mixer and have them all baked in an hour.  Easy, affordable and delicious, it really deserves 10 stars IMO.","PLEASE!!! Correct this recipe! It's two sticks of butter! I wasted good ingredients making a recipe I thought was the original. Not at all vanishing oatmeal cookies! Booo!","I can't bake anything without making alterations and these were no different. I used half applesauce, half margarine, 2\/3 cup of each of the sugars, flax instead of eggs, wheat flour instead of white, double vanilla and nearly double the salt, and just a sprinkling of nutmeg. My goodness, are they lovely! Fragrant, and crisp on the outside\/chewy on the inside. These cookies lend themselves well to alterations. Full of hearty whole grains, packed with fiber, low in fat, and absolutely delicious. Thanks!","Easy and good.  Just what you are thinking of when you think oatmeal cookie.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and used .25 cup less sugar and half an egg less.  Would be good with any dried fruit or chocolate chips.","My granddaughter introduced me to these and I usually keep pretty close to the recipe - they're the best, just as she said. But just to show how flexible they are, I came to the old folks' FL retreat and found some pancake mix (the \"complete\" kind), oil, brown sugar, eggs, raisins, oats (and walnuts). So I looked online for this recipe and baked them with only those ingredients - and they're still irresistible!","I added pecans and they were chunkier and yum. I also substituted chocolate chips for the raisins. YUM! I have made them several times... one time i forgot the white sugar- and they were still great. this time i am adding some mollases and spice to them. ;)","These are very good and easy to make. My kind of cookie. They came out nice and chewy. I thought the amount of cinnamon was just right. I might decrease the sugar by 2 or 3 tablespoons next time, but that's just me. I might also throw in a cup of toasted walnuts. You can see I'm enthusiastic about these. I'm already thinking about when I'll make them next time and the last batch is still cooling. I made fairly small cookies, so did not add any additional flour. Thank you for sharing a lovely recipe with us.","I just have to say, I have been making this recipe every year as part of the family traditional cookies.  They are a hit every year.  And, this year, I go to get the recipe on the oatmeal container, AND THEY HAVE CHANGED IT!!!!  (now calls for a stick & 6 tablespoons of butter instead of 2 sticks).  So, glad to know someone preserved the correct recipe here.  I am writing it down this year (call me silly, I just never worried about it).","mmmmm! I have made these several times. I like that there is a high ratio of oats to flour. Sometimes I substitute some ground flax for some of the flour. It enriches them, and adds fiber. To make these really really easily, melt the butter first, and just mix everything together. The laziest way but it works fine!","These are great cookies, but adding a cup of Heath Englsih Toffee Bits to the recipe makes these the best cookies you will ever eat!","Very good, but next time I'll add more cinnamon","Ok, first let me say we loved your recipe.  DH ate and ate and ate.  The only thing is I didn&#039;t use raisins, I subbed in butterscotch chips instead.  This cookie is soft and moist and full of flavor.  We will use the raisins next go round but I had a half bag of chips to use up.  THank you for such a wonderful cookie recipe.  Everyone should try these, they are that good.","I melt the butter first.  It takes a bit more stirring, but I find it easier than waiting for the butter to soften.  They also taste better.  I  use a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon.  Everybody loves them.  This recipe doubles well, which is good for bake sales and group functions.","This is it !!!!!!!!!!! I use to have this recipe but lost it a while back. Now it is in my cookie book for good.","Finally.....a oatmeal cookie that isn&#039;t on the dry side! This will definitely be added to our cookie rotation.","I have made these 4 times now, and I LOVE them!  Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are my favorite and this is one of the best recipes I&#039;ve found.  It&#039;s very dependable and always turns out well.  I even upped the recipe to make 500 cookies for our church picnic and they turned out amazingly, even with the abundant amount of cookie dough that we got out of them.  These will be my go to &quot;sweet tooth&quot; healer from now on.  Thank you so much for such a great recipe Dale Goodman!","Update 9\/14\/14 - Interesting, I just made these and realize that the recipe that&#039;s on the Quaker Oats box has changed. It calls for only 1\/2c plus 6T of butter, and only 3\/4 c brown sugar.  I was wondering why the cookies were turning out a lot lumpier than I remember.  I think this original recipe with more shortening and more brown sugar come out with a better texture.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;These are my favorite OR cookies - they come out perfect every time.  I like my OR a little on the soft\/chewy side, so I love the texture of these, and the taste cannot be beat - perfect amount of spice and raisins.","I tried this, but I prefer the &quot;Vanishing Oatmeal Raisin Cookies&quot; recipe found on the Quaker Oats web site. It&#039;s almost the same as this one, except this one uses a full cup of butter instead of the 1\/2 cup + 6 T that the Quaker Oats recipe calls for. These just spread a little too much and were a bit on the greasy side. I think that&#039;s due to too much butter in the mix. If you use this recipe, reduce the butter by 2 T.","USE ALMOND FLOUR for a tasty variation to this recipe.","OMG!! The absolute best Oatmeal cookie recipe ever. Super easy and very tasty. I did not have any baking soda on hand so i subbed with 3 times baking powder and still turned out yummy. I also exed the raisins and added dried apples and now im hooked. :)","I substituted 1\/4 cup of canola oil for 1 stick of butter, and used half the amount of granulated sugar and brown sugar than the recipe called. Cookies still turned out soft (with less fat versus using 2 sticks of butter), and quite sweet because of the raisins&#039; natural sweetness. I ended up with 2 dozen palm-sized cookies. My husband loved them!","I like to add dried cranberries instead of rains and I also add a cup of chopped walnuts plus 1\/2 cup or more white choc chips..and usually a tiny bit more oats also.  Yummmmm","Best oatmeal cookies i have ever made!","These are so good! I've made them several times now and they always turn out just right.","the worse oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had in my life. You claim it is the original Quaker Oats recipe but after the epic failure of your recipe I see you got creative and changed measurements, they were horrible, total mess.","To those who condemn this recipe while pointing at current Quaker Oats box recipe, this recipe IS what the Quaker Oats recipe on the box used to be. I still use this one for a number of reasons. It is what I grew up eating. It works well. It uses an even number of sticks of butter (which is great convenience). The key to success with this recipe is using the proper creaming method (I start with room temperature butter or slightly colder and I beat the butter and sugar for nearly ten minutes) and then mixing the flour as little as possible to get a dough that doesn't develop gluten. If you make this recipe with the butter too soft you will get spreading cookies that will be a mess. I have developed type 2 diabetes not by eating fast food, but by home baking. This year I am going to try this recipe with carbalose flour, sukrin gold, erythritol, and about 1\/4 cup of real sugar. (Sadly, even though sugar alcohols work well for most things, they neither brown nor carmelize. Cookies cannot be made into health food!)","I have been making this recipe since I was a child in the 70s. It was the first baking I ever did. I often use dried cranberries and white chocolate chips instead of raisins. Best oatmeal cookie recipe ever.","Love the recipe but don't like the cinnamon in it","This recipe at the end says to add cinnamon with the flour But there is no mention of cinnamon, Soo how much cinnamon is supposed to be added","UH yeah, grease the pan","This is NOT the recipe from Quaker! The real recipe has 1c butter, no white sugar,(1.5c Brown not 1c) and it needs cinnamon.","I love this recipe, at first was really discouraged from the negative ratings. It was my first time making this and I tweaked the recipe a little with the helpful comments below. Turned out really good! I used cinnamon as well to bring out the flavour even more.","*Please list the cinnamon in the ingredients - I've made this a million times, and forgotten the cinnamon a few. I know, how can you forget cinnamon in oatmeal cookies!? But with 9 people and two dogs in a very small house, distractions sometimes win the day. Ok, that said, I've had to test a few subs to accommodate raisin allergies and low-sugar needs. Craisins are a no-brainer, no adjustments needed sub for the raisins, but the sugar is a bit trickier. Sugar substitutes don't melt or cook like white and brown sugar, so liquid adjustments are necessary. I've experimented with adding more egg white, more whole eggs, some canola oil. This morning's sub mix seems to be a winner, although I used more brown sugar and whole egg than I'd like - DH just won't be able to have quite as many as he'd like in a day. ;) The whole cup of brown sugar, half cup of sugar substitute, 3 whole eggs, and a 1\/4 cup of canola oil. I'd love to hear any suggestions anyone else has worked out. We'd like them to be a bit healthier, but still look and feel like the original recipe.","I've used coconut oil in place of some of the butter. The recipe on the container calls for 1c&amp;6T of butter and zero canola oil. So I've used 1c butter and the rest cocnut oil. They were good! Also I use half old fashioned &amp; half quick cook oats.","I made these just as recipe shows using old fashioned oats. Did not spread as picture shows. Not very good as cookies. BUT we crumbled them and layered with yogurt. Better than as cookies. I was a (home) commercial baker for many years and never had a failure like this.","I think I failed this because they are in cupcake cups then I pressed chips into them.... I don't even want them now.","Is this recipe from Quaker Oats? Because if it is, you are missing more butter and I think this is the reason why the cookies didn't spread at all. 1\/2 cup butter + 1 cup brown sugar +1\/2 cup white sugar did not make my mixture creamy at all, it was crumbly. They did not spread at all. Like many moms out there, I baked tons of cookies in my lifetime and sadly to say, these cookies are the worse tasting ever, very dry, not appetizing at all.","Delicious, I add chopped walnuts, craisins and chopped dates, so moist and yummy !","These cookies turned out horribly. They did not spread out due to the shortage of butter.","I've made several versions of 'Vanishing Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies&quot;. The several versions I've tried all didn't spread out and I thought that odd - holding them to the same standard as Choc.Chip and other cookies. But the sheer &quot;mass' of all the raisins and oatmeal certainly contributes to that. As it turns out, that's how these recipes turn out in every case. I caused them to spread I bit by going to slight larger toggles scoop and gently pressing each dough-ball with a glass cup to about 2\/3 its full height - just to get a little width to them (wetting and shaking off excess water helps and is fast). These cookies - though small in the 6 or 7 versions I've made - are perfect for kids. They taste incredible. I suppose who aren't happy with a thick small cookie can make the dough balls larger and press them more - the cookies will still come out with ample mass to please any O-R cookie lover. I live on O-R cookies as my treat and I've had a lot of them - these are right up there with the tasty ones. I also subbed Sun-Maid Fruit Bits for the raisins - those were great too.","Very easy to make, and taste great! Thank you for sharing.","I have made oatmeal raisin cookies many times. I usually use the quaker oats recipe merged with my Grandma's for a unique personal version of oatmeal raisin cookies. I couldn't find my Grandma's recipe so I went with this recipe after using it to compare it to the quaker oats one. This recipe is short 12 tbsp of butter compared to the Quaker recipe. Both the quaker recipe and this recipe have too much flour. This recipe has 1\/2 cup more of brown sugar (same amt. of white sugar) than the quaker recipe and it still has too much flour. I will be remaking them with less flour and more sugar. If I am pleased w\/ my alterations and I remember, I will post them on here!","I used chocolate chips instead of raisins. I really enjoy cinnamon and chocolate together though. It was really easy and pretty good! Will make again for sure!","Did not work at all!! I could tell right away there wasnt enough butter!! Regular recipe calls for 1\/2 pound not half cup. A big waste of momey as the cookies tasted amd looked awful","I have made these many times... they're great!!!","I agree with haggyone1963, this recipe states 1\/2 c butter. They came out hard as rock. I've made the cookies from the Quaker Oats website before and they were wonderful. I was in a hurry and just googled the recipe and this was the first one that came up. Boy, did I pay for that. They had a decent taste, but I think I chipped a tooth.","I have to admit I was a little hesitant to follow this recipe after reading some of the comments. However, they came out great following ingredients and measurements as listed. I didn't add raisins or chocolate chips in case the recipe didn't turn out well, but I definitely will next time!","Love these! I cut recipe in half since there is just 2 of us. Made 2 dozen. I also added more spice. I will make these again for sure!","I thought the website should know The metric Version of this recipe is not accurate, dry ingredients plus the butter are supposed to be measured in grams not ml\u2019s.","I cooked this recipe in my muffin pan. Just filled each cup halfway up. Cooked perfectly in 25 mins. Great breakfast snack.","This has far too little butter. The recipe directly from Quaker calls for 2.5 sticks - 1.5 cups of butter. It also has an overload of brown sugar, 3\/4 of a cup is the recipe amount. I knew something was wrong as soon as I looked at the recipe, the ratios are off since the rest of the recipe is the same.","Fast, easy and yummy recipe.

I did add nuts for more nutrition and texture which turned out well.","Beautiful and tasty muffins! I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding dry cranberries instead of fresh. I would suggest chopping the cranberries up first. The coconut adds just enough sweetness to off-set the tartness of the cranberry. I will definitely make these again!","I more than halved the sugar to 1\/3 cup and finely blended the cranberries in with the liquids, since I don&#039;t like biting into a sour cranberry. My coconut flakes were unsweetened and my cranberries were sweetened. Also substituted whole wheat for half of the flour. Very good, extremely light and fluffy muffins, and healthy-tasting with the whole wheat. A bit too baking powdery for my taste, I may experiment with that, as well. If you blend the cranberries like I did, be forewarned that the cranberry flavour pretty much disappears; the coconut flavour and texture becomes predominant."],"vegetarian":"Y","pescetarian":"Y","vegan":"N","lactose intolerant":"Y","gluten free":"Y","peanut allergy":"Y","kosher":"Y","halal":"N"},{"id":3201,"name":"holiday season cranberry bread","minutes":75,"ingredient_ids":[2683,6906,332,6270,335,5058,840,2499,2790,7642],"ingredients":["flour","sugar","baking powder","salt","baking soda","orange juice","butter","egg","fresh cranberries","walnuts"],"steps":["sift flour , sugar , baking powder , salt and soda into large bowl and set aside","add 2 tablespoons melted butter to 3 \/ 4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice","add beaten egg to orange mixture and add to dry ingredients","mix until dry ingredients are moistened","stir in chopped nuts and cranberries","turn into 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan","bake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes to 1 hour","let stand 24 hours before slicing","this recipe freezes very well - i usually wrap first in saran wrap , then wrap it in aluminum foil and then place in zip-lock bags - i generally take out of the freezer the night before serving , if possible","delicious plain or with butter or cream cheese spread on it"],"description":"we always have a lot of people visiting during the holiday season and it's always nice to have a little something homemade on hand to offer.  this bread is nice to give away as gifts during the holidays.  delicious plain, with butter or with cream cheese (<-- my personal favorite).  thank you mom for this recipe. :)","calorie_level":1,"avg_rating":4.8333333333,"review":["This is a wonderful holiday bread.  I make it every year and give some of the loaves to my close friends and neighbors who look forward to this special treat.  It is especially delicious served with a hot cup of Christmas tea.","I  think  I  will  try  this  one  next  week!!!  sounds  soooo  good.","I made this yesterday and just had my first piece tonight.  It is everything that orange cranberry bread should be and with only 2 tablespoons of butter!  As an aside, I omitted the nuts- just a personal preference.","This is DELICIOUS! I loved it so much, I'm planning to make a batch of small loaves just to give away for Christmas! Thanks!","Excellent bread. Easy to make. No substitutions needed. If you are running low on fresh cranberries it comes out well with a combination of fresh and dried berries (but the fresh are best, as they give it such a tang). I also once made it with hazelnuts instead of walnuts- very good. To make for a lactose intolerant friend I substituted canola oil for the butter. When fresh cranberries are no longer available, I enjoy this bread year-round with fresh blueberries or frozen cherries.","Very tasty!  I subbed 1\/4 c wheat germ for 1\/4 c of the flour and used sliced almonds instead of the walnuts.","This was delicious!  Smelled wonderful too!","It was very tasty despite the fact that I slightly overcooked it. I omitted the nuts. The prep took me longer than 15 minutes because halving cranberries is not my forte. It was worth the extra time though.","Shared this bread with co-workers and got two immediate requests for the recipe.  It is filled with healthy-for-you stuff and little butter. The tartness of the cranberries adds great flavor.  I added a sprinkling of sparkling sugar to the top before baking.  Simply sublime!","Boo, nut haters!  The walnuts in here make this loaf awesome.  I only had 1 c. of fresh cranberries, so instead I microwaved 3\/4 c. dried ones with 2 Tbsp. brandy & water to cover for 1 min.  I also added 1 Tbsp. orange zest, which went well.","I was going to post my recipe for cranberry bread until I saw this one- it is the same, except mine has orange zest in it (as another reviewer added). I make it to give away to other teachers at the school where I work. It is always a big hit. My one year old baby LOVES this bread. For him, I make it without nuts since he is not having them yet.","This is a great recipe.  I  baked mine in a flute pan and it came out beautiful.  It is a keeper."],"vegetarian":"Y","pescetarian":"Y","vegan":"N","lactose intolerant":"N","gluten free":"Y","peanut allergy":"Y","kosher":"Y","halal":"N"}]
