Added some oranges because we didn''t have enough lemons. I think I''ll be making this for my daughters birthday party!!!REVMy parents went like wow when they dranked it! REVReally nice lemonade. Used a potato peeler to get the zest off.  No white comes off if you do it in a light pressure zig zag.  After it chilled the children loved the zest sprinkled with more sugar.REVIt was hot the other day and I decided to make some lemonade.  This really quenched our thirst and was awesome!REVThe taste was excellent, and it really wasn''t difficult to make at all.  My stepdaughter and I did this one afternoon, and everything turned out great the only change we made was to add more hot water to dissolve the sugar the amount called for was not quite enough.  Very good taste, especially with the lemon zest.  Excellent recipe we''ll use often.REVcomplicated recipe but cool.REVMy favourite lemonade recipe is essentially the same as this. Allowing the sugar to absorb the lemon oils is what makes it so delicious. The syrup is quite concentrated so a little goes a long way. I usually use the zest of 4 lemons, their juice and 1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup sugar. It''s good old fashioned lemonade. Use mineral water to dilute the syrup and you get a great fizzy drink.REVI made this with limes instead of lemosn and it was the best limeade i''ve ever had! sooo good!');

Then removed and sauteacuteed the chicken breasts which I did not cover during cooking. Made my sauce in the same pan and poured over my chicken. I just had the butcher cut chicken breasts in half. Did not pound them. I baked for approximately 30 minutes covered and they came out great! The sauce is excellent!REVThis was AMAZING with a few minor changes. I only used 6 breast halves, but the same amount of the sauce. I sauteed onions and garlic in the same pan after I removed the mushrooms.  To the sauce mixture I added dried oregano and thyme and added back the onions and garlic to let it all reduce together.    I served with mashed potatoes.REVThis was delicious !  I used 4 chicken breasts which when cut and pounded made 8 nice pieces and left all the other ingredient amounts the same.  I subbed fontina for the mozzarella.

AWSOME!  We cut it down for 2 and it was one of the best meals we have had in awhile.REVWe just loved this one!  I cut boneless chicken breasts into pieces, then followed the rest of the recipe.  It came out juicy and we loved the taste!REVThis was YUMMY!  My only changes were 4 chicken breastslrg cut into 4 pieces each and I put the salt on the chicken before I dredged it in the flour.  I didn''t have anything but white cooking wine and burgundy.  Did less than called for but upped the chicken broth.  Also didn''t have fresh parmesan cheese  but since I doubled the sauce, the chicken was almost floating.  Sprinkled the pregrated parmesan and then covered with mozzarella.  Everyone of my family loved this.  Great quick chicken meal.  I will be stocking the staples for the future!REVWhen I first read through the ingredients, I thought that the quantity of marsala would overwhelm the dish, but, boy, was I wrong!  In spite of its great rich flavor, this recipe is much lighter than I expected. Easy to put together.  I did as one reviewer suggested and made the entire sauce recipe and only two chicken breasts DH likes lots of sauce, and it was the perfect amount for our taste.  Served over fettucine with roasted asparagus on the side. This recipe''s a keeper!!REVthis was SOOO good!! the flavor was awesome! all the flavors blended so well. it would be 6 stars if that was possible.REVDH  I really enjoyed this recipe!

Will be making thisdish again soon.REVLove this dish!  Have made this for friends as well and everyone is always impressed.  Great flavor!REVThis is an excellent dish. I opted to serve it with roasted potatoes instead of noodles. The combination was very delicious and made a nice presentation on the plate!REVThis dish is out of this world. I used marinaited capatella cheese, provalone, and parmesan. The combination of cheeses was wonderful. I made rosemary buttered noodles asa my side dish along with a nice crusty loaf of bread. YUMMY!!!! Cudos on this recipe Mrs. QREVMy family loves this recipe !REVMy Guests raved about this dish! I followed the directions exactly and it was wonderful. Served it with steamed asparagus and a green salad no noodles or carbs of any kind.  My wife said to be sure to keep this recipe as it is now one of her favorite chicken dishes. REVThis was easy enough to make though, it took me longer because I could only cook two chicken filets at a time.  Very tasty.  If you use noodles, I would suggest to double and perhaps triple the amount of sauce simmered chicken broth and marsala at the end because it goes great over the noodles I also recommend egg noodles for this dish.  Will definitely make again.REVWhen I made it I didn''t have any wine, so I used a few drops of spiced vinegar and sugar.  Also, as a variation I made it with pork chops, except I substituted the broth with apple juice, water, spiced vinegar, a touch of mustard and cinnamon.  Also, very good.  Both ways, definitely a keeper.REVThis is an easytomake and enjoyable dish. I made a few subsitutions in the recipeinstead of Marsala and chicken broth which I didn''t haveI used canned tomatoes and I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. It was great served with pasta.REVI give this recipe a good to high rating because it just tastes good and is realitivly easy to make.  I used Cream Sherry as I didn''t have any Marsala, and it turned out really good. Broiling the cheese is a really good idea, its adds just a little crunch that makes this dish supurb!REVthis is a real keeper.

This will be my new standard recipe for beef stew!REVmade this in my slow cooker....delicious!REVits aiightREVThis was an easy, tasty, and healthy stew. I used regular stew meat and yellow onions with carrots, celery, new potatoes, and parsnip as well as a few extra seasonings, including a pinch of powdered cayenne pepper and a 12 t. of sugar. The thickened gravy was especially good.REVThis is a great beef stew didn''t use the pearl onions, just sliced yellow...and used some leftover green beans for the sugar snaps.
Make for the Lowfat event in CPF.REVThis was an OK stew, but I had to add many more vegetables and double the base to really make it a meal, which is what I expect when making a stew. Left out the pearl onions and used a white onion, sliced thickly. The flavor of the base may make it worth trying again.REVmmm mmm good! We enjoyed this stew very much.  I used ordinary stewing beef and used sherry for the wine, delicious!  I used less bably carrots and added celery, rutabega, fennel bulb and rather than pearl onions, which are to hard to get, used regular white onon and left out the snap peas in favour of the fennel bulb. I cut all the veggies into large chunks.  Also cut the cornstarch to just one tablespoon  which thickened it quite nicely.  Lovely favlourful stew, I will be makeing again.');

Fantastic recipe...thanks.REVA different kind of bruschetta, but I couldn''t ask for a more tasty treat. I served these up as the first course of an italian feast for my parents anniversary.

Tasty dressing. The parsley was a nice touch. Cilantro would have worked as well. It was very good served as a side to spicy chicken fajitas with some rice and guacamole and summer squash.REVWasn''t thrilled with this salad much at all. Didn''t like the texture of the black beans with corn and we found the whole thing pretty much tasteless.  Sorry but won''t be repeating this one.REVThis a great with hamburgers after over a week of holiday food.  Simple, light and easy!  Taking some suggestions from other reviewers, I did add a dash of cilantro and also some chick peas I had left over from another recipe.  I loved the flavors!  Will make this again!REVYummy! I was looking for something easy to whip up for a dinner party. The main dish was chicken enchiladas and this recipe made a great side dish. I threw this all together and heated it on the stove for about 10 minutes. I used a can of seasoned black beans, and I threw in some ground cumin and garlic salt. I didn''t use lettuce leaves since I served it hot. Come summer I''ll try this as a salad!REVI loved this! Made recipe just as written. Beautiful simple flavors. Served this with some leftover chicken skewers and lettuce.REVDelicious!  I will definitely make this again.  I brought it to a church function, and had requests for the link to your recipe.  I used frozen corn.  Thanks!REVGreat salad ... only addition I made was equal amounts of cilantro and parsley.  Will make again.REVThis recipe is one that I make again.  I loved all of the flavors and textures.  Unfortunately, the rest of my family didn''t as much...but that''s ok...more for me!REVThanks, Dave, for a tasty and simple to make salad.

Yummy!REVEasy and simple.  We loved it. Thanks.REVThis salad is a complete, satisfying, refreshing and nutritious meal and quite pretty too, I must say!. The next time around I will probably use less lemon juice a bit too much ''zing'' for my personal taste, but I will definately make it again.REVThis tasted great!  I also used a lot of cilantro.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!REVEasy and delicious! I used frozen corn and served this with cuban spiced pork chops 134871. Very good. Needed a little salt and pepper, but a very nice summer salad. REVThis was a delicious salad! We subbed coriander cilantro for the parsley and used frozen corn and cooked, dried beans.REVWe liked this recipe a lot because it''s very flavorful.  As I''ve had a chance to adjust the recipe to our taste, it''s evolved into something that we enjoy often.  We substitute lime juice for the lemon juice and significantly increase the amount.  I use frozen corn and instead of the fresh parsely leaves I use a lot of cilantro.  As mentioned by another reviewer, I throw in a good pinch of sea salt.  Usually, I substitute a finely minced red onion for the scallion.  I also find that the flavors in this salad improve greatly as it sits, so I try to make it the evening before we want to eat it.  This is a staple at our house!  It''s very versatile and my kids love it with some chips or to roll into a tortilla.  Thank you for posting it!REVThis was quite good and even better the second day after the flavors had more time to blend.  I used frozen corn to save time and it worked very well I undercooked it just a bit to keep it''s crunch.  Next time I would use less olive oil.REVthe combination of ingredients is smart, but this recipe as is desparately needs some sea salt and balsamic vinegar for that extra kick.REVThis recipe was awesome!

All my kids raved about it, so we will use this often this summer.  Next time I plan to try it on some ribs!REVThis was super quick and easy to make.  It has a wonderful, rich flavour and is equally nice for a brush on sauce on the grill or a slow cook method.  I added a small drop of liquid smoke flavour and extra garlic.  I''ve made this many times since I first found the recipe and everyone LOVES it.  Use it on any meat, it''s great!REVWhat flavor!  Used on chicken and my son grabbed what was left of the sauce to take home.  Can''t wait to try this on ribs now.  Made for the Comfort Cafe, a tag game.REVOutstanding!  The only change I made was add 2 Tblsp water rather than add 1 Tblsp water to dry mustard.  Didn''t have expresso so made a strong pot of coffee and added that.  Fabulous flavor  deep and rich.

The whole family was raving over the barbecue sauce and wanted to know the brand and store where we bought it! Even grandma, who was sure that it would be too spicy for her, asked for more to dip her barbecued ribs into. Thanks for sharing the recipe!REVThis is a great sauce!  The only change I made was to substitute apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  Next time I think I''m going to mix in chipotle powder with the chili powder for a smokey kick.REVThis sauce is amazing. I have been looking for a recipe for a sauce similar to the sauce served at my favorite hometown rib joint. This is the closest thing I have found. I followed the recipe and only added 14 cup of bourbon.REVThis was an excellent sauce! I did cut it in half and still have some left for next time. It was really tangy and BH really liked it. He was the one who braved the cold and went outside to cook it on the grill after I had marinaded two ribs for about an hour. I gave him some extra sauce to baste with and all turned out well. The time it took to prepare and the long list of ingredients used was well worth it. I may even try this during the winter as a slow roast or even a crockpot recipe for ribs as I still have quite a few of them in the freezer.REVVery nice flavored bbq sauce!

I added dethawed frozen pea pods  broccoli florets once the celery  onions were tender. I''ll repeat this recipe with different veggie combinations in the future.

It was easy to make  my 6yr old and I used the full amount of almond extract and crumbled the toasted almonds by hand.  It''s a great recipe for turning the yuck bananas into something yummy.REVCame out great for a chocolate Easter cake. I made an almond cream cheese frosting instead of a chocolate glaze to make it more Springlike. Very moist and the banana is definately the strongest flavor coming from the cake. Will definately make again.REVStep 11 states to drizzle glaze over top and down side of cake, but WHAT glaze? I''d already used all the ingredients in the cake, and hadn''t set aside anything to use to make a glaze. While it smelled fabulous while baking, and had a moist, dense texture, the flavor didn''t measure up. I did substitue unsalted butter for the margarine, and generic almonds instead of Dole brand but I would think the butter would have made it better, not worse. I did make my own glaze, which was fine, but it really didn''t help the cake.REVYum! This cake was gone in no time. It was really light and moist.I used butter. I cut the sugar down to 1c and  I also didn''t make a glaze for it and it was delicious and sweet enough for us. My boyfriend went out and bought more bananas for me to make it again!');

Everyone raved over it.  We did add the leftover pork filling from the egg rolls to it, as we did not want to waste anything.  It actually gave some additional texture and color, with the grated carrots.  We did not use 4 eggs, but cut that amount in half.  Also, we substituted the red chile paste with cayenne pepper.  All of it tasted better than any restaurant we have been to in the USA and abroad.  Thanks again for the great and  fairly quick recipe.REVI can''t believe how great this recipe is!  It tastes just like the hot and sour soup I have been craving, but can''t have in the UK bc we can''t afford to eat out.  

I left out the pork, eggs, carrot, water chestnut, and black fungus.  It was delicious.  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and did not find the soup thick at all.

Next time I''ll try to find golden needles and black fungus, and then maybe open a Chinese restaurant!  

Thanks for a great recipe that I''ll be sharing with family and friends!REVI made this recipe exactly how it is written except omitting the tofu, and it turned out pretty good. I really like the restaurant version of hot  sour soup, and this had a little different taste, but VERY close! I think the ingredients that threw the flavor off was the mushrooms. I used canned shiitake  straw mushroom only way I could find them and was not impress with the flavor  texture it gave. Next attempt will be with fresh button mushrooms...which I''ve had at a couple Chinese restaurants. Thanks so much!!REVThis was an awesome recipe.  I was looking for something that replicated a soup that my fiance and I had in Hong Kong and with a few additions this recipe was perfect.  Used more broth and less cornstarch.  Added cilantro, bean sprouts, half the chili paste, and used regular mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms.  Next time I think I will make it thicker and possibly add noodles in place of tofu.  My fiance is already begging me to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe Nancy!REVWe really enjoyed this soup. My 15yo daughter has been jonesing for Hot  Sour soup so off I went to find a recipe. My 14 LOVED it, the grownups did too! I used 2 eggs, all dried mushrooms which I hydrated, added both chicken and tofu. I was not thick from the corn starch or too salty or too tangy from the vinegar. It was a golden brown color and very appealing.  Super good on day 2 for lunch! It''s a winner all the way around. Thanks for sharing Nancy!REVAWESOME !!!!! I will never buy  hot  sour soup  from  a  restaraunt  again !
i added some wasabi bean sauce  and japanese  pepper pods  to  heat  it  up  a bit more but   apart  from  that it  was SPOT ONREVThis is a GREAT recipe. Super easy to make, and tastes better than the soup in most of the chinese restaurants Ive been to!REVVery good !! I didn''t have chili  paste so used 2 large cloves of garlic and a heaping 12 tsp. of Italian pepper seeds. That was just the right amount of heat for us. 1 rounded Tbsp. of cornstarch was perfect. Did use about 12 tsp. of pepper but will omit it next time. The bite was harsh. I will also omit the egg. I don''t believe it adds to the flavor and the broth would be much more appealing to the eye without it. Did garnish with chopped Cilantro. It added a nice flavor and additional color.REVTakes a bit of time to make, but it is one of the greats for hot and sour.REVThis was outstanding.  I reduced a few ingredients 1 tb chile sauce, 12 pkg of tofu, 3 tb cornstarch and 3 eggs.  And I didn''t use the fungus.  It was fabulous and surprisingly easy  I have saved this in my favorites!REVAbsolutely delicious!  Relying on some of the other reviews, I used only 1 tsp. of cornstarch and 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste, and when tastetesting it was not spicy enough my family likes strong taste so I ended up using 2 tbsp paste as the recipe said.  I also increased the soy to 3 tbsp and used 13 cup rice vinegar in place of 14 cup white vinegar.  I also used lowsodium soy sauce, which worked fine.  This was wonderful, flavorful and very authentictasting.  Thanks for a great recipe!REVOk so this is an ok recipe I added some stuff and mine tastes like it came from a restaurant black fungus lily flower buds and a few other things and it perfectREVI can''t believe I have never left a rating on this absolutely fabulous recipe.  I''ve made it for years and everyone just raves over it. The recipe has been passed out numerous times. It is the BEST hot and sour soup I have ever had and that includes in Chinese restaurants.  It is my go to recipe, period. 
We like it hot so I used 3 tablespoons of the garlicchili sauce. I omitted the carrots and used 2 beaten eggs instead of the more healthy egg substitute. Regarding the cornstarch, I just keep adding the slurry until it looks to be the right consistency.  Everything else is as the recipe recommends....including the black fungus...or wood ear mushrooms. 
Thanks so much, Nancy.REVI just finished making this for dinner tonight and just had to taste it.  What a flavor sensation. I didn''t see where it said to add the carrots so I put them in with the bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts.   I used 1 T  garlic red chili sauce, 14 c. egg substitute and only had button mushrooms and dried shitake and  also no tofu.   This is one dynamite hot and sour soup.  I can''t wait until I have all the correct ingredients.  This is great as I made it though.REVIt was just what we were looking for!  I didn''t have some of the mushrooms and skipped the tofu but it was great!  We''ll definitely be making this recipe again.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, we cut back the Chili to 1.5 tbsp and it was just the right heat.REVOh. My. This is the holy grail of Hot and Sour Soup. Fried up a batch of wonton strips and everybody had seconds. This is a definite keeper.REVWhen I visited China I ate a lot of hot and sour soup, mostly because I could be more sure of the ingredients!  This is the closest I''ve found to the taste of the soup there, better than any restaurant soup I''ve tried.  I make it with extra garlic chile mix and no meat.  Only problem is, I haven''t found dried black fungus.  Maybe it would be even better?REVWe love to order hot and sour soup in the restaurant, so I was a bit leary of trying this at home.  I knew my family would be tough to please when it came to this soup.  I read through the instructions and thought I will try it.  I am so glad I did....this is so good.  I used my homemade chicken stock, and instead of straw mushrooms I used button mushrooms what I had on hand, otherwise followed your recipe exactly.  We really loved this and I plan on making this quite often when we make a chinese style meal.  Thank you so much for posting this.REVI''m so happy to have found this soup!  I happily used 2 T of garlic chili sauce  I like my lips to be a little numb when I finish my Hot and Sour Soup!  I only used 1 egg and didn''t have any dried black fungus.  I also used about 8 oz of tofu and that was plenty for us.  My husband and son were so impressed, they figured the local Chinese restaurant could use me for a chef. Thanks for posting!REVgreat flavor  I made it fully vegan so omitted the pork and egg and used vegetarian base.  I would def. tone down the heat a bit for most audiences.  I love the spice but it was even hot for me.REVI was unable to find the black fungi but the recipe turned out GREAT! I''ve tried dozens of recipes and none can compare to this one. It''s a keeper.REVSpot on!REVI am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I thought with all the positive reviews here it would be restaurantquality. Boy was I wrong!I followed this recipe exactly, omitting the water chestnut and carrots, but I still found it too bitter. I would back off on the vinegar but I can''t think of any other way to improve this recipe. It was just plain awful! I will pay 1 for a cup of awesome authentic hot  sour at my local Chinese restaurant from now on.REVWonderful recipe with the modifications others have suggested less chili paste, cornstarch, egg a slight bit more vinegar  I used rice vinegar. I also reduced the soy sauce to 1 T. Also, to make things even easier, I use canned straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots and baby corn, and reconstituted shiitake mushrooms. I also omitted the pork and water chestnuts. If I have more time, I like to add the black fungus, and tiger lily buds golden needles.REVJust as good as any Chinese restaurant soup!  Excellent flavor and overall taste!REVExcellent !REVBelieve everything. I made this soup a week ago and I''m about to make it again, so I thought I would post. Excellent soup. I''m not much of a cook so I just went through the comments and modified the recipe to my liking based on what others said. I was very impressed with the way it turned out, will make often.REVVery good recipe. I enjoyed the spiciness very much, as my family is used to eating very spicy Indian dishes. However, if you are not into extremely spicy foods, I suggest reducing the chili paste.

SashwatREVGreat recipe for anyone who like it as close as it come to the real thing! Very simple to make and you can find all the ingredents in your local supermarket! I myself would cut back on the white pepper and add a little bit of hot oil not to much! I would also add about 1 12 tbls more of vineger. or to taste add a little more meat and you can serve with a bowl of white rice with steamed veggies for a meal of its own.REVmy family like the bamboo shoots whole. but we love your recipeREVMy boyfriend and i were very pleased with this recipe. he is half chinese so he knows the good stuff. the only thing we changed was the amount of chili paste. we only put one tablespoon instead of 2. the soup is very very spicy with 2 tblsp''s. other than that it was great. the flavor is awesome. my boyfriend said that it tasted just like his mom''s. that is a great compliment.
amityREVLoved it!REVthis was pretty good on the whole. a few things the cornstarch was waaay too much and it made the soup unbearably thick, less soupy and more mealie. i''ll probably use just three tablespoons next time, perhaps less. the two tablespoons of chili sauce were also too much, just one would suffice. otherwise, the recipe is good. i omitted the pork and used less egg. i couldn''t find black fungus so used dried wild mushrooms which worked out just fine. the soup is very filling and will have your scalp sweating by the time you''re done.REVWith a few adjustments this is the best I have ever made.  I''ve searched far and wide for a good recipe, and here it is.  I added two additional cups of broth.  Used 2 tablespoons of corn starch, two eggs, and a splash more vinegar.  I agree that using the two tablespoons of chili sauce makes it really really hot, but I like it that way.  Served it with sticky rice.  It was tremendous.  What a find.  Thanks for posting this recipe.REVThis recipe is the bomb!  This is the closest to the restaurant kind that I''ve ever encountered.  It has a permanent home in my personal recipe box now.  As said in earlier posts, I would definitely only recommend using 1 Tbsp. of the chili sauce instead of 2 Tbsp.  Also, only 4 Tbsp. of the corn starch is needed.  Otherwise, it''ll congeal pretty quickly.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone seeking the real thing.REVI found this to be just great!  I cut the recipe in half, and I took some of the others'' advice and reduced the cornstarch for half the recipe I only used 1 Tbsp.  I also did not use the black fungus, used rice vinegar instead of white, and only used 1 egg.  This tasted like I was eating it at a restaurant...I served it with steamed dumplings and Pad Thai as the main course.REVKick ass!  I love hot and sour soup and I could live on it!  This recipe is oooh la la. 

Here''s what I did different  halfed the amount of garlic and chili paste and that''s saying a lot bc I love me some HOT stuff, and halfed the amount of cornstarch.  I doubled the amount of soy, vinegar and sesame oil.  I also increased the egg and tofu amount a tiny bit bc I excluded the yolks in half the eggs I used and I love tofu.  USE YOUR OWN VARIATION AND ENJOY  IT DOESN''T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!!REVExcellent recipe, however I used only one egg  cut back on the corn starch. I''ve also used canned chinese stirfry vegetables bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, mushrooms  bean sprouts  frozen shrimp in this soup for variation  ease.REVWOW!  This really IS the BEST!!!!  I took others advice, and only used 1 Tbsp. of the chili paste, and it was more than enough.  I don''t like tofu, so I just used twice as much of the mushrooms.  If you''re looking for the best, this is it!REVWe make this recipe OFTEN! It is the best we''ve ever tasted. Modifications
1.Double recipe and freeze it.
2. Leave out eggs until ready to eat.
3. Black pepper instead of white.
4. Use only 5 TBSP cornstarch in doubled recipe.
5. Leave out bamboo shoots.
6. Use whatever kind of mushrooms are available. Usually a mix of several kinds.
7. Rice vinegar instead of white.
8. Leave out black fungus.REVWith a few adjustments, this is about perfect.  Like others, I found 1 tbsp. of garlic and red chile paste provided plenty of punch and 2 tbsp. cornstarch was right.  I used 4 eggs, but next time I''ll use two.  The vegetables can be varied at will.  I used Golden Needles, but no fungus and regular mushrooms instead of the straw.  We did not care for water chestnuts in the soup and I wouldn''t use them next time.  And there WILL be a next time, because I am now done looking for the Hot and Sour Soup of my dreams.REVTastse surpasses any found in Chinese restaurant!  Presents well.  Simple to make.
I cut hot pepper by 50, omitted the pork.  Am striving to reduce the sodium.REVThis is the first time I''ve left a review.  Could not resist because this soup was so good.  I always order Hot  Sour soup at chinese restaurants, it''s my favourite.  And I''ve tried to make it from scratch several times unsuccessfully.  This recipe was easy and the ultimate Hot  Sour soup.  I will never look further for a recipe.  The changes I made were to use 1.5 tbsp of chili paste I like spice but would reduce further if not used to it, 2 eggs and 3 tbsp of cornstarch, no pork, no straw mushrooms and substituted dried porcini mushrooms for the dried black fungus. Next time I''d try to find the dried black fungus and cut the water chestnuts into smaller pieces. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.REVI just made this soup.........I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  It is soooo good!  I made it as stated in the recipe except I only put 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste.  This is even better than any hot sour soup I''ve had at Chinese restaurants!  Thanks for this keeper!REVI made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.I cut the chili paste in half,used less cornstarch , 2 eggs and substituted chicken for pork. It had enough heat, but each person could add more chili sauce if desired. I will make this again.REVI made this as it is listed.  I really enjoyed it and will make it again soon.REVWay too hot!  Cut the chili paste dramatically if you don''t want to burn your lips!  I ruined the whole batch by following the directions exactly.  I wish I had followed the other reviewers'' advice!REVAlso loved this recipe.  Cut back on the eggs used 3 and omitted pork and tofu.  Added a splash more vinegar an used reconstituted shiitake''s.  Yum!  Perfect for killing a cold.REVI apologize for taking so long to review this recipe as I have made this now at least 3 times. I did make some changes but only because we like our soup not quit as thick as what this recipe calls for. Therefore I used 4 tbs of cornstarch and 2 eggs. I did not think that the chili sauce needed to be adjusted. We all agreed that it had just the right amount of heat. My daughter enjoys this so much that she now fixes a big pot of it on the weekends minus all the meat and veggies and eats it for lunch through out the week. This is a prize recipe.');

I got my fix. Thanks for posting Carole Reu!!REVThis turned out really good and was a big hit with our resident chocolate lovers at Christmas dinner.  A couple notes I made it the night before and left it in the fridge overnight. I used 4 egg yolks instead of 3 in the filling and 1 milk. The finished pie had a little bit of syrupy liquid in it. Apparently this is from the meringue and is completely normal, it did not change the taste of the pie at all. I also used a store bought graham cracker pie crust which worked just fine. It set almost immediately and cut into real slices. Great recipe.REVI didn''t put the Meringue on top of the pie because we don''t like it, but make it as a Chocolate Cream Pie...  We LOVED this pie!  Thick and rich chocolate.  Perfect with some Cool Whip on top... Yum!REVMy only problem with this recipe is that I now have to try really hard to not be a little snot when someone else makes a chocolate pie I want to tell them their pie is alright but my new recipe is so much better. WOW!! 10 stars! I like pie, but I love this one, and it is now the pie I have to make for every event because it039s just too good to pass up an opportunity to eat it. So rich and thick. Had no trouble getting it to set up. Very easy to make if you039re handy with a whisk. I was careful to add the mixture to my yolks very gradually. And keeping my whites refrigerated seemed to help the meringue set up better. I039ve made it with and without crust and love it both ways.REVThe filling is good but my mirange didn039t set up. I followed the instructions.REVPie shell...how about it,do you have directions for it or only for fillingREVI loved this pie just as it is written because I prefer something denser that I can actually cut into a pretty slice and my spoon still goes right through. But my husband preferred his grandmother''s version understandable, and she only uses a 13 cup of flour and does not bring it to a boil, just to the point of thickening. She also said that she forgot all about adding any salt. Hers tastes great, but it did not cut into actual slices.REVThis didn''t turn out good for me either, same as Katybird.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made sure to stir continuously using a wooden spoon in a nonstick pan on medium heat and I couldn''t even let it come to a boil as it was thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan.  So I went ahead and put half into a bowl with the egg yolks stirred well return egg mixture to pan, still stirring continuously it was starting to smooth out but then before it could reach boiling point, it started thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan again and cramping my hand.  Please give me suggestions as to what may have caused this or how to prevent that from happening should I try and make it again in the future.  Thanks, ReginaREVJust wasn''t chocolatey enough for us ... It just wasn''t as good as I anticipated.REVThe recipe has turned out great for me. The taste is chocolaty rich!!! First time at baking a chcolate pie without using a boxed pudding. Loved it. Easy to follow recipe too. Thank you.REVLoved this pie the flavor was just what I was looking for.  DH wanted a chocolate Meringue Pie and this fit the bill.  My only problem and it''s probably my technique as I''m new to this was that it wasn''t firm enough to hold it''s shape when cut.  I''m thinking maybe I didn''t cook it long enough but will be making this again and I''m sure perfection will come with practice.  That said the flavor of the rich chocolate can''t be beat.  Thanks Carole for a wonderful recipe.REVwhen i made this pie,i forgot to add the butter and vanilla,just didn''t read very carefully,and i didn''t know if i should have baked the pie crust before adding the mixture.i put the filling in the crust and baked it for about 10 minutes took it out and let it cool a little bit then put the meringue on top,the pie turned out just GREAT i can''t believe that anyone hasn''t rated before now.the only reason that i rated it a four is because of the confusion with the crustREVMade it this morning but used my own meringue recipe.The pie was gorgeous,not overly sweet,very creamy but firm enough to set beautifully.My husband a confirmed chocaholic gave a satisfied groan as he tasted it!
Really easy, I recommend it.REVChocolate lovers you gotta try this one!  This pie is so rich and chocolatey.  It more than satisfied my chocolate fix.REVThis was easy and excellent. The chocolate part is a dense, rich pudding, not fluffy. I used 12 tsp of white vinegar since I didn''t have cream of tartar.REVI have recommended this recipe and would like to add this was by far the easiest chocolate pie I''ve made.  I used 4 yolks in pie and used corn starch for meringue, they both worked great.REVI grew up loving my Grandmother''s Chocolate cream pie. I never thought I could ever make one as good as hers. Well, this is IT! This easy to follow recipe and well balance ingedents make this a keeper! Thanks Carole ReuREVThe best chocolate pie EVER! It was awesome and easy.REVThis was a great pie very easy, and it tasted just like my grandma used to make. Also, the chocolate and sugar combination was perfect..REVI am sorry but this did not turn out for me at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up with a super thick mixture of goo that I could barely get a spoon through.  I think if I had used a lot less flour it might have turned out better but as written it just did not work for me.REVThis pie was beautiful.  Everyone loved it.  I did have a syruptype liquid at the bottom of pie.  This may have been from my meringue or something I did wrong.

The only two additions I make are 2 tbsp grated onion mixed in with everything else and a sprinkling of Old Bay or J.O.''s on the top before baking.

I made this for a barbaque this labor day it was so easy and fast to prepare.  I subsituted the dry  mustard for regular mustard and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt I also added extra cheese and crab meat was a hit everone wanted this recipe. I want to say thanks for making me look so good.   
REVA BIT HIT!!!! This is absolutely fantastic. I made this for Thanksgiving guest and served with different types of gourmet crackers. Everyone kept saying how wonderful this was. Needless to say it went fast. I doubled the ingredients to make twice as much and all the measurements worked fine. I did add a little more cheddar cheese to the dip...just about 2 more TBSP because I love cheese and apparently so does everyone else. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!REVThis taste great!!!!!! Even my 3yr. old loved itREVOutstanding dip for chips, but especially broc and cauliflower...My coworkers got most of it, but not before I at least got a decent taste. Thanx for a great recipe !REVGood stuff. Very good stuff.REVVery good and EASY to make.  This was a big hit with everyone.  A few of them even said, it was the best crab dip they ever tasted!!!REVmade this for superbowl sunday  everyone RAVED about how wonderful it was!!!  several people even asked for the recipe.  positively THE BEST crab dip I have ever had!!!!!  A new staple in my recipe book!!!!REVAbsolutely fantastic!!  I had to use prepackaged crab meat as fresh was unavailable, and it turned out great!  When it finished cooking, I put in into a hollowed out bread loaf french bread, and used the left over bread cut up as dipping pieces  WOW!!  This was a hit with my guests!  I will definately make this again.REVThis has replaced my staple crab dip and I may not make it again.REVThis was excellent.  I made for a work pot luck and it was scarfed down in no time.  I used imitation crab meat , fresh minced garlic and substituted TexMex cheese for the cheddar.  I will make this again for sure.  Easy and delicious.REVI used 12 imitation crab and 12 salad sized shrimp and added some old bay seasoning for some spice. I made a casserole dish of it for a pot luck party,it was gone! all of it, there were people eating as sandwiches they liked it so much!REVThis was really good.  I used a pound of crabmeat and it was delicious.  Next time I will add some finely chopped onions.
JudiREVQuick,easy and delicious!REVThis is the best crab dip. The only substitution I made was to use 12 t. minced garlic and regular salt. Yummy and I served with assorted crackers. My family and I give it top honors. Thanks for sharing this.REVThis crap dip recipe has replaced our spinach con queso for a while! This was so good with big wheat crackers. Everything about it was great! Nice ans salty too! The way a dip should be!REVThe kids  I had this for supper last night, using fresh broccoli for dipping. I had to use 2 cans of drained crab meat 4.25oz each, which made the texture a bit weird, but the flavor was divine. I look forward to someday making this with fresh crabmeat. The combo with the broccoli flavor was a good one, but I might try celery next time to get more of the solo dip flavor.REVThis was wonderful, and so easy to make I could almost do it with my eyes closed! I tried to keep this lower fat to stay close to my diet, so I used fatfree mayo, fatfree cream cheese, and fatfree cheddar in this, and it still tasted fantastic! I did go ahead and mix all the cheese into the dip before heating since fatfree cheese doesn''t like to melt on top but will when it is stirred into a dish. It warmed up very nicely and was great on crackers! Thanks for a great recipe!REVMy girlfriend has a source of fresh crab on a regular basis and since I have found recipezaar she phones me weekly and we always chat about the new crab recipes that I have found before the conversation is over. Thankfully she also shares because this sounds wonderful.REVThanks for the wonderful recipe! I used fresh Dungeness crab and everyone loved it! This recipe is definitely a keeper!REVThis was gone in a matter of minutes on xmas eve.  I too used imitation crab meat, and it tasted like the real deal!  I baked a loaf of french bread for dipping, yummy!REVExcellent crab dip. Rich and creamy. The worcestershire really adds to the flavor. We spread this on our favorite crackers and that was our dinner. Yummy!! Appreciate the recipe.REVI can''t believe how many reviews this dip has gotten, so I had to try it myself.  It disappeared before my very eyes!  I would definitely add diced onions, more garlic, and some cayenne or something to give it a kick...REVI needed another dip for a party that I was having and I made this one.  It was a big hit and my party guests kept talking about it all night. REVAmazing crab dip! I served this as sort of a side dish with some broiled shrimp and we really enjoyed the flavor. I didn''t change a thing, it isn''t necessary. Thanks for posting.REVAfter all the great reviews this has received, I was expecting an out of this world dip.  However, I was very disappointed with the final result when I prepared this.  It came out really soupy and was very greasy...I''m not sure why as I only lightly greased the casserole.  I might try this again to see if I get different results...if so, I''ll revise my review.  REVThis dip was a big hit during Thanksgiving.  I served it with some toasted bread as an appetizer and my guest just loved it.  I used imitation crab meat instead and it was still GREAT!  REVMade this for a small gathing of friends this past week, and everyone just raved about it.  It was gone in no time, and they were still asking for more!  The only change I made was adding about 34 cup of grated parmesan cheese.  Very, very yumpy....  Thanks for the great recipe!REVGreat recipe!  It went very quickly at my recent dinner party.  I did use 1 clove of garlic, minced, salt, about a tablespoon of minced onion, and a dash of hot pepper sauce.  I didn''t have any milk, but it didn''t seem to need it.  I also added a little extra cheddar cheese.REVThis is a fairly good dip but it needed more flavor and I would have liked it to have been a little hotter.  Maybe I''ll add hot sauce next time as another reviewer suggested.  I did substitute minced garlic for the garlic salt, doubled the recipe, and heated it in my crockpot for about 3 hours.REVI brought this to a hurricane party, and I swear I turned around and it was gone! Everyone ate the dip as fast as I put in on the table! People were ranting and raving about how good it was. Thank you so much for your post!REVThis was a pretty good dip, but I find that it is lacking something and I just don''t know what. The tangysour flavor from the cream cheese,sour cream and lemon juice was certainly overpowering the whole dip. It needed something with a spicy taste, I think, to balance the flavor. Also, The cheese I had melted on topcheddar had a layer of oil from cooking.After it had cooled a little the whole top layer of cheese came off in one piece. Maybe next time if I remake itI will mix all the cheese in to the main mix. Other than those small flaws it was edible and the flavor of the crab meat really came through.REVthis is the best I''ve had in a long time. just needed a little pinch of red pepper to my taste.');

Light and nice for a warm summer afternoon.REVI used the juice of just 1 orange in part because I only had balsamic vinegar and I thought the sweetness would be enough. I decided to wilt my bok choy a bit in the same pan I did the chicken in, and tossed it with the dressing in that pan. I also used bamboo shoots and some baby corn.

The second time I made it, I didn''t have anymore mushrooms so I subbed some shredded zucchini, and had run out of walnuts as well. It was just as good though! I recommend mixing the shredded cheese in a little not just topping it, only thing I do differently!REVI made this almost as the recipe called for. I only had cheddar and pecans on hand and so used those as a sub. If serving as a vegetarian meal, walnuts are the way to go as walnuts are an essential part of a vegetarians diet.

It combines sweet like sweet potatoes, Oriental and a stuffinglike taste. I do not believe the combination works at all.  It would work better to pick one of the styles, instead of combining tastes that don''t work well together. 

Stuffing Style remove the brown sugar and soy sauce, add some soft breadcrumbs, double the basil.

Oriental Style substitute almonds for walnuts, remove brown sugar and basil.

Sweet Style remove soy sauce and basil. Increase the brown sugar.REVI can''t believe I haven''t rated this before now.

The melted muenster cheese really topped it off well.  I think I''ll be making it again this week as we''re getting more squash in our CSA delivery box.  Thanks for posting it!REVThis was my first time making acorn squash, and was looking for a nonsweet, vegetarian recipe. This was the one I went with. The results were ohsogood! Although next time I will follow the recipe more closely, I did have to make a few small changes because in each case I didn''t have fresh onhand I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I soaked and finely chopped, frozen broccoli, and dried basil I also added some dried parsley. I didn''t have walnuts so I had to omit those. I''m a vegan, so instead of using muenster, I used a vegan cheddar cheese that is made by Follow Your Heart, and instead of butter, I used a vegan margerine. The results were still amazing. I will make this again, next time with allfresh ingredients. REVI thought this was great, but made a few minor changes. I used olive oil instead of butter healthier and sharp cheddar instead of muenster cheese. Next time I make it there will be a next time! I would scoop out some of the softened squash and mix it with the filling prior to topping with cheese. It was a nice mix of flavors, and the splash of soy sauce gave it more of a depth of flavor. REVExcellent recipe!  I couldn''t find any muenster cheese so I used aged gouda and it was very tasty.REVThis was great!  I hate to be one of those people but I did have to make a couple of changes since I had to use what was onhand.  I didn039t have broccoli so I substituted about 112 cups of swiss chard, and let me tell you, that was an EXCELLENT choice!  I might actually do this every time.  I also had to use pecans instead of walnuts no big deal and I used a combination of ricotta and mozzarella instead of muenster cheese.  The cheeses were a BIG success as well.  I feel like my substitutions didn039t change the recipe too much, so I feel confident in giving this a 5star rating.

Once again DA!!! kenk, thanks for the recipe!REVI''m sure mine didn''t turn out the way intended, as I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces since I don''t like large bites of potato. Then, on top of doing that, I left them in the water after boiling, until I was ready for them, I knew all along what the result might be, based on the things I was doing lol. I considered posting my result on here as a new recipe, but realized that really, it''s still the same recipe, with a slight variation, so others can choose which way they''re in the mood for, each time they make it. What happened was that as I was mixing everything together, yes, go figure, the potatoes started falling apart. So, I ended up with something between mashed potatoes  potato salad, only far more garlicky, but very good. Oh,  I did add a tad of dried dill, sweet basil  white pepper. My son had wanted hamburgers, but I didn''t want to serve the typical chips, or fries or macaroni  cheese with them, so when I found this recipe I thought it would be a nice fit, a little less plain. I also served it with my Caribbean Coleslaw recipe 290325 which was nice  light which helped balance out the garlic flavor. For desert I served my Rocky Road Chocolate Mousse 286486 which was nice, because it was cool  light,  we could each choose how much we wanted, I only had a little because by that time I was very full duh.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe that was simple and apparently infallible lol!REVMMMMM we loved this recipe!REVYummy....this was absolutely wonderful.  Prepared like FoodExplorer. as I have a heavy hand with potatoes, and didn''t want them to mush up.   However, I did not bake them in the oven.  I microwaved them a few minutes to precook a tad before I sliced them.  The sauce was brilliant.  Thnx for posting kenk.REVReally wonderful side dish.  Went together fast.  Will definitely make again!REVWow these potatoes are fantastic!  So easy to prepare and a great side dish for the summer.  I will definitely make these again!REVTastes good, but nothing much to rave about. Pretty easy recipe. Also, I have tried this with both parsley and cilantro, and I think the cilantro gives it a better taste.REVA great recipe.  When I was in Spain, we ate this all the time at our favorite bar.  The owner''s secret was to use a bay leaf in the potatoes while you are boiling them.  It adds just a little background flavor.REVI love garlic, so I added another clove. Garlic lovers unite!REVDelicious!  I used red potatoes and homemade mayonnaise made with lemon juice and high quality safflower oil.  Also, I increased the amount of parsley by 1 tbsp.  Highly recommended!REVOne of the best tapas during my tapas party. Simple to make,big garlic flavor for all garlic lovers out there !REVI had this dish at a funeral luncheon, and had to find a recipe for it. This is very easy to make  I just wing the quantities when cooking for myself  as I039d eat four servings if they were in front of me.REVThanks for easy and good recipe!  I used the recommended lemon juice to thin out the mayo.  It had a nice garlic flavor and made a great addition to the potluck I took it to.REVI was about to post this when I saw you''d beaten me to it! 

We really enjoyed this. It had a great flavor and texture. She recommends using homemade mayonnaise she also recommends using Spanish ingredients when available. Great with a glass of red wine or sangria! Also makes a nice side disha refreshing change from Americanstyle potato salad.REVI really liked this. Instead of boiling the potatoes, I fried them. It was faster this way. They ended up tasting cheesy. I would have never imagines they would taste this good. The reason I''m only giving it a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 is because they were very greasy.REVI loved these!  Such a simple recipe and so much flavor.  Thanks for sharing.REVMmm this was wonderful.  We roasted the potatoes but made the aioli as directed, adding a little bit of lemon juice to lowfat mayonnaise.  The flavour was awesome. I was going to halve the recipe because there are only 2 of us but since there was only 12 cup left in the jar I used it all.  I''m glad I did, I can''t wait to use it again!REVMade this lovely potato dish for dinner tonight, it was fantastic!! A garlic lover''s dish, simple to make and simple to enjoy!!  This will become a summer regular in hour hourse, heck probably an all year long regular!!Thanks for sharing.REVOutstanding!! What a delicious dipping sauce.

I served this with steak and salad for a delicious quick and easy meal, thanks for sharing.REVI was bored with mashed, baked, boiled, and roasted potatoes.

My husband, my 3 year old and my 1 12 year old loved them.  I''m making them again tomorrow!!!REVGreat potato recipeinstead of boiling and chopping up the potatoes, I baked them and cut them horizontally into circles.  Then I placed them on a greased cookie sheet, brushed them with olive oil and a little bit of salt and broiled them until the skins were crispy.  I served them with the sauce as listed in the recipe, which I made early and let sit for a while so the flavors could meld.
I made these with fried chicken, green beans and biscuits... thank you!! REVyummy yummy!!! I couldn''t keep my fingers out of the mayo mixture. I also added a touch of dry sherry, all I had. I have been looking for something like this for ages, and now i can have my fix anytime. It''s so simple i''m suprised i never thought of it. Thank you very much for posting, will be making again and again. Foodlover1REVWe loved how this tasted.  We are on Weight Watchers and used low calorie mayo and it still came out excellent.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!REVWonderful!  I used roasted garlic and added some citrus lime juice as suggested.  I made enough for fourthey were sorry I didn''t make more...REVExcellent recipe!

I used Granny Smith and Braeburn apples, cut the butter back to around 4 tablespoons and used a bit more flour, brown sugar, and oatmeal  than the recipe called for. This was great and lasted a week in our fridge just fine.REVI used Haralson apples and got rave reviews.  My only quibble was that a 9x13 pan is too big for this recipe.  The topping didn''t fully cover the pan and the apples cooked down so that it was barely a quarter inch think.  I''d either double the recipe or use a smaller pan.REVI love the texture of the topping, and the flavor of the nuts is yummy! I thought while I was making it that I should spice up the topping, which would still be tasty, but leaving it without the extra spices let the flavor of the nuts come through.

Awesome recipe!REVI followed the directions except that I left out the walnuts.  It was very good!REVThis recipe turned out great! It tasted delicious! I substituted lime juice instead of lemon, and I didn''t have enough topping for a 9x13 pan, but I quickly and easily whipped up a second batch in my food processor to cover the rest of the pan. Reason for this could be that I was eating it while slicing apples   I served it with vanilla bean ice cream and warm caramel syrup drizzled over the top. I also sprinkled some cinnamon over the ice cream and garnished with cinnamon sticks. Delicious!REVTakes a little more time to make but it is totally worth it!!

She does make a few changes though  in oat mixture she only used 4 Tbs butter and puts the extra 2 Tbs in with the apple mixture.  She only uses 4 c apples  I think because we enjoy more topping and doesn''t use lemon juice or walnuts, but I think I will try it next time!  She also uses an 8x8 dish.  Thanks, this recipe is a keeper for sure!REVI couldn''t find my Mom''s recipe for apple crisp, and I knew she wasn''t home yet, so I couldn''t call to get it from her.  So, I found this one, and it''s just as good!  Perfect time of year for apple anything, and the oats and brown sugar go so well together.  I think I could justify eating this for breakfast. Thanks for the recipe. Oh, I used closer to ten apples, but they were on the smallish side.REVI chose this recipe over another because it uses less butter. It was great! I used Granny Smith apples and omitted the walnuts. Topped it with homemade whipped cream and it was just what I wanted. Reminded me of the apple crisp I used to eat as a kid.REVJust what I was looking for.  I try to avoid butter, so I substituted with lowfat yogurt butter and it was fabulous.  Didn''t even miss it.

Carole in OrlandoREVI tagged this recipe knowing that it was one of your adoptees and you hadn''t made it yet.  I would never have made this as written.  It is my belief, and only my belief, veggies in a frittata should be crisp tender.  Hope you don''t mind that I took some liberty with this recipe.  I sliced the squash thin and added some green onions and red bell pepper.  Cooked the onion and bell pepper for a few minutes in a lightly buttered cast iron skillet, added the squash and cooked to wilt.  Poured the eggs mixture of egg substitute mixed with 1 tablespoon crme fraiche, black pepper and Italian seasoning over the veggies.  Cooked, lifting egg to allow the uncooked portion to go to the bottom of the pan.  When eggs were almost set, I topped them off with freshly grated parmesan cheese and placed under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  The family enjoyed this served with fresh biscuits.REVMy husband loves squash so he made this for himself today. He also followed PaulaG''s lead and sauteed the squash till crisptender instead of boiling it. It''s also better cut into rings instead of diced small, for texture. He used egg subsitute and omitted the cheese to knock off all that cholesterol, so this was much healthier. This made a delicious satisfying brunch for him.REVThis Yellow Squash Frittata was Yummy!  I used the creme fraiche made from scratch.  Served the squash dish with a roll of buttered lefse.  A real treat.');

Thanks!REVI followed the original recipe, but added a grated garlic clove, after reading the reviews.  I enjoyed the moist texture but will add sweet corn kernels to give it more of a hushpuppielike taste.  I will also do a teaspoon size dollop, should cook through more evenly, I think.  A great way to use the plethera of yellow squash I have in my freezer from this summers garden!REVThese are a family favorite!  I also add some cayenne pepper when certain ones will not be eating this... I enjoy the little bounce of flavor... also, use white cornmeal as the meal will not color the yellow squash.  You should try these with a little hand grated cheddar added to the batter... Yummy!REVDelicious! I did take the suggestion of another poster and added some sweet kernel corn. I think that next time, in order to cut back on the fat, I''ll add a little oil to the batter and try to bake these.REVFantastic!  I made these to use up some yellow squash and zucchini.  I made quantity for 6 servings, added a whole can of corn, and a tablespoon of sugar.  Served alongside baked fish sticks.REVMy family loved these things... !  I made them even more delish by using lard. Yes, that four letter word. Try it and I promise the final result will not seem so greasy or heavy after you''ve eaten a dozen!  This recipe should definitely be doubled in order to make a decent amount. I used about 4 medium sized squash to do it and then food processed the squash to make it nice and mashed. Also food processed the onions.REVThis was delicious. It reminded me of hushpuppies. I added alittle celery seed to the batter for alittle extra flavor. 
I thought I made a review for this but don''t see it listed so I am adding another. 
I shared a few puffs with a friend and she just had to have the recipe, she loved them too. This is a keeper!! Thanks for posting a neat way to use squash. REVThese are delicious!  I made them as written but plan on try some of the suggestions of the other reviewers, especially adding southwestern flavors and sweet corn to the batter.  This was an excellent recipe to help me use up the bumper crop of yellow squash coming out of my garden.  Thanks Riffraff br82611Adding stars and also want to comment that these reheat really well, SO, since we''re getting so sick and tired of squash been eating it for 3 weeks now, I''m going to make a huge batch of these and freeze them to eat during the winter, I''m sure we''ll love squash again in January!!REVYellow squash are my favorite squash.  I would simplify it by using selfrising flour.  I would also fry the puffs in Ghee, for extra flavor.  By the way, thanks for the new word offal to be added to my vocabulary, pronounces the same as awful.REVThese are really tasty! I think we''ll try adding hot sauce next time we make them.REVReally enjoyed this.  I added a little less onion and then put in onion powder instead, just simply because I wanted my children to eat them.  I also put the smashed squash into a stainer and shook out excess water.REVThese puffed up nice. I modified the recipe slightly for my picky eater. DD loved the hush puppies served on our summer vacation down south. I omitted the onion and added about     1 c.whole kernel sweet corn in its place. I doubled the recipe and used a whole medium fresh squash, shredded, with skin on in the food processor using the grating attachment no prior cooking required!. ltbrgtMy DS wanted ketchup on his, we also had some with honey.This is a really fun way to use up a little yellow squash and get some veggies in otherwise because they wouldn039t eat squash knowing it was in  there. ltbrgtThanks for sharing.REVTasty little puffs! I would add a little more seasoning next time, maybe cayenne or thyme and maybe make them a little smaller. Great way to use up all those yellow squash that are around this time of year. Thanks for posting.REVThanks for posting this very yummy recipe.  I added 2 teaspoons of sugar because I like sweet cornbread and I grated a clove of garlic to even out the onion...It was just great!  Thanks again!REVTasty little things, but mine were more flat like a pancake or latke. Not sure why they lost their shape. I used an electric skillet and thought it worked pretty slick.REVfirst off, i replaced cornmeal w cornflour, so maybe this is why i had creamy centers...but, it just didnt work for me. Hardly any flavor. REVThis sounds really GOOD!!!  Thank you, I need all the recipes for yellow squash I can get... can''t wait to make it!REVThese taste very good, and are a nice way to use up the yellow squash abundance from summer gardens.  They don''t taste like squash, which would be appealing for those who don''t care for yellow squash.  I agree that they could work nicely as a substitute for hush puppies.REVyummy!  A good way to hide veggies from kids since they look and taste like hushpuppies!  We loved themREVVery yummy......... my kids loved it!  But for me??  To high in calories!!! REVeveryone will love these as an alternative to the someimes dry hushpuppies.  If you''d like to have a little more zing to your squash puffs  substitute fish fry instead of the cornmeal...this gives it a little more seasoning with some spice to it.REVMy 6 year old loved them. I made a few changes because I didn''t have cornmeal in the house. I used whole wheat bread crumbs and for the onion I used 2 Tablespoons of parmasan cheese. Thanks for a great kid friendly recipe.REVMy boys looked at these and said is there squash in here?....ooohhh they are getting better about finding those hidden vegetables.  BUT they loved them and I had no leftovers....Thanks for a great recipe!REVI tried this recipe over the weekend. I thought I had some cornmeal but when I opened the bag, I wasn''t sure if it was still good. So since I already had the recipe started I just added some extra flour.  Needless to say, the puffs were pretty doughy on the inside. Maybe it would be better with the cornmeal. I may try again another time.REVI would probably call these fritters more than puffs, but they were delicious no matter what you call them! I loved them on their own, but I also tried this mixture as a batter for deepfried zucchini and it is great for that, too. The main key there is not to put too much batter on the zucchini because the corn flavor can kind of overpower the zucchini. REVThese were very good.  Good for using up squash.  Thanks for posting.REVWe have made these a bunch of times and love them! Great way to get kids to eat veggies!! I''ve added cheese before and it was great!! Thanks for the recipe! One of our family favorites.REVThese were very good as the recipe stands.  We made two batches.  In the second batch we cut the cornmeal with breadcrumbs which lightened it up some and added southwestern ingredients like finely chopped jalapeno and green onion, garlic powder, cayene pepper, paprika and cumin.  We just put enough dough for one or two in separate bowl and everyone added what they thought would be good.  We also had various dipping sauces available.  The southwestern flavors dipped in ranch won the day. Thanks riffraff for a good recipe using up some of the garden squash as well as a couple of hours entertainment for the family.REVthese were great. i used Jiffy cornbread mix,prepared as on the box, lots of onion powder, some cayenne, and a lil hot salsa that was left in the fridge. the squash gave this a nice texture, and a way to get my bf to eat the squash. i ate them with a lil maple syrup, n he dipped his in a bit of ketchup. this one''s a keeper!REVAwesome recipe!  I did alter it a bit and used about 3 onions and then served them with sour cream and hot sauce.  That combination really brings out the flavor.REVThese were wonderful!  Super easy to make!!  My 5  7 year old even ate them.  We added a little Iowa sweet corn.  Yum!!!!REVJust made these and they remind me of potato latkes or pancakes.  They were quite tasty, but I really try to avoid frying, and that is the only criticism I have.  I wonder if spraying a broiler pan with Pam and putting them in the oven would work?  Maybe I''ll try that the next time I want to make these when I have an extra supply of squash.  A friend dropped off a box maybe 100 small squashand I chose a bunch of Zaar yellow squash recipes that appealed to me.  The only problem is that I still have half a box left!  I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.  I just chopped the onion roughly, and the machine did the rest.  It makes one life a lot easier.  Thank you riffraff for the tasty and savory recipe.REVLooking for ways to use up all my summer squash, i tried these..oh my, sooo good !!!i couldnt stop eating them. I served them with a curry dipping sauce. They would make fantastic appetizers with a little green salad. I will be making these all summer long. thanks for a great recipe.');

Cap''n JackREVI took another reviewers advice and I added 1T of bourbon to the filling. I also doubled the filling except I left the white sugar at 14 cup and added 12 cup brown sugar. I used Karo brown sugar corn syrup for the dark corn syrup and added natural maple flavoring.  I added a pinch of cloves to the filling and 12t of fresh ground nutmeg. I think I only baked it about 50 minutes.REVFabulous.REVI am giving this a five star rating because to do otherwise would not be fair. I did change this greatly though.  First I used Splenda in the pumpkin layer.  Secondly I left out completely the sugar in the top layer and used only the corn syrup.  The results a lower carb version and less sweet.  I was recieved rave reviews and a thanks giving a less sweet option.REVMy husband started the day a week or two ago saying he wanted sweet potato pie so we went looking for one to make.  I took a Pillsbury crust from the freezer and let it defrost while we searched.  We came across this one and he decided instantly that it was what he wanted.  We really enjoyed it, but thought that there was not enough sweet potato filling.  Next time we''d double the sweet potato part and leave the pecan topping the same.  It really is the best of both worlds, though!REVMy husband''s comment This is definitely a doover!  Delicious!  Tasted like a pecan pie with a little texture of pumpkin pie.  I added more of each spice, used brown sugar instead of white, and half corn syruphalf maple syrup recommended by another reviewer.  While the filling wasn''t supershallow in the pie dish, I would agree with other''s recommendations to doubleincrease the filling.  This is such a good pie you''re going to want more of it anyways!REVVery delicious and great combination of sweet potato and pecan. Perfect level of sweetness.REVI really like this.  Sometimes a pecan pie is a little too much for me and this had such a nice layered flavor.REVWe love this!  Made it for second Thanksgiving in a row.  This year I made some changes  used maple syrup instead of the corn syrup and put a tablespoon of bourbon in the sweet potato portion which I doubled to fit into a 10 inch deep dish pie.

We had pork satay, and I used the sauce from that for both dishes.REVI love GadoGado and this is a very good recipe.   I sometimes put the salad on a bed of Watrecress when available  Thanks CarolREVMy husband and I lived in Malaysia for 4 years and became WELL acquainted with the local food.  We loved GadoGado which is Indonesian but the Malay love it also and it is seen on many restaurant menus throughout the country.  Southeast Asians normally peel their cucumbers but since we hae returned to living in the states I DON''T, not only because of the nutrient value, but also it adds color to the salad.  I also add shredded carrots to the salad for the same reason but keep the rest of the veggies most like how it was served in Malaysia and Indonesia. 3  The secret to having the BEST GadoGado is the fresh peanut sauce that is used as the dressing.  If making it fresh isn''t your thing, try using Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce found in your local Safeway store in the Ethic region.  It''s the most like the IndonesianMalay sauce served with this salad.  MOST recipes in Malaysia include Tofu cut into small cubes, dusted in cornstarch and fried up in a wok and then added on top of the salad just before serving.  It''s wonderful!!

It ended up better than I''d get at a restaurant!REVThe first time I made this, it was a little bland. This time I added cranberries halfway through cooking and more crushed red pepper... maybe not as authentic, but the cranberries really added depth! It was great, and went over well with my critic. REVFantastic tasty meal, I made some chipati to accompany it, but used cauliflower rice instead of cauliflower florets, and added a teaspoon of curry powder to taste just before the end.REVThis was a good standard. I felt like it was missing something...I can''t put my finger on it. I followed another reviewers advice and added a sprinkling of garam masala, but I guess I didn''t add enough. Made a nice healthy meal complemented by Recipe 21855REVall i could taste was lime REVit was ok.REVPretty bland, but that may be the fault of six cups of rice.

This recipe is easy to follow with simple ingredients which are easy to find at most grocery stores.

It039s great served with a spicy main I served it with a very hot chicken tikka masala amp some rice. Overall good but I think I will add more cauliflower next time.REVTerrific recipe! I followed other peoples suggestions and used broth instead of water and added a teaspoon of garam Marsala. Excellent!  I made it for a dinner party and had to share the recipe with everyone.  This digs was. A hit!REVSo good, I made it 7 weeks in a row and never got sick of it. I use ground cumin, frozen cauliflower florets, canned diced tomatoes and add 1 tsp of veggie Better than Bouillon to the water. I also let it cook on medhigh for 1520 minutes and the lentils turn out nice and mushy like at restaurants. I rave about this recipe to everyone I know.REVThis was amazing!

used vegetable stock instead of water and added chopped carrot and peas to up the veggy quota. Oh and grind the cumin seedsor use pre ground as it gets a fuller flavour then but otherwise YUMMY! my kids loved it, as did I. 
I can imagine it would be a touch boring if made exact to recipe but adding stock and ground cumin gave it a lovely rich flavour. make a double batch!!!REVThis recipe makes the best Dal I''ve had at home ever... and it''s so authentic! It reminds me of the Dal I used to have at my best friend''s place during my school days. The only possible change I''d make is to increase the amount of red peppers for a little more ''heat''. Also, you can omit the rice, and drink this as a wonderful lentil soup. It''s great for when you have a really bad cold, and need something to warm you up. Thanks for sharing this one... I''m sooo gonna make it over and over!REVThis dish was incredibly tasty and easy to make as well! I substituted broccoli for the cauliflower that''s the only thing I had on hand and added a bit more red pepper because I like my dal spicy. Altogether a great recipe . . . all my roommates loved the smell and the taste!REVI made this recipe for some guests who had spent time in India.  They couldn''t beleive how great it was!  I modified by cooking in pressure cooker for about 10 minutes at high pressure.  I allowed the guests to add more heat by having Thai spicy sauce on the side.  A DEFINITE WINNER!REVenjoyed this very much, I usually puree my dal, but this is much nicer.  Thank youREVThis makes a very attractive dish.  I made it pretty much as the recipe called for.  If I were change anything, I might add additional red pepper flakes.  Other than that this was very good.REVThis recipe is simply delicious.

My husband and I had it with some tandoori pork chops and rice.REVThis is a family favourite in our house. I originally got it from Cooking Light but was happy to find it here on ''Zaar. I usually use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and double the ginger. I serve with basmati rice, a big dollop of plain yoghurt, and microwaved pappadums. I sometimes partially puree this. I usually use red lentils, but see in the pictures some people have used brown. Might try that for something different!REVI just made this for dinner, it was so easy and fast, I didn''t add Cauliflower didn''t have anyand added ground coriander didn''t have fresh. I added a little more salt, to my taste. It only took about 15 min of cooking which was great. I love the colour, texture and taste. Next time I might experiment with adding other spices like garramasala and curry powder for added idian flavours. I love it thank you so much.REVGaram Masala was essential. It was lacking something without it, I also used fresh jalepenos. I served coriander chutney available on the side as well and I made home made naan to go with it. I also used yellow split peas instead of lentils a little less lime juice and after everything was suatee''d I threw it in the crock pot.REVGreat dal.  I needed a basic dal I took out the cauliflower for my rice with a veg dish and this was just perfect.REVThis was pretty good, I have been searching for a good dhal recipe. I liked the added cauliflower  tomato. My husband thinks a little spinach at the end would be nice as well. It made a huge pot which we ate for lunch the next day and still leftovers!REVIt turned out good, I forgot the ginger and it would have been better had I added it.  I also pureed it when it was done and mixed the rice into the puree...it tasted great.REVI''ve never had Lentil Dal before. It was fairly bland to me, from my experience with curry type dishes. I do love the idea that it is a healthy vegetarian dish.  I would make it again for myself since I love to eat healthy, but I would never make it for company or a hot date.REVLovely flavours,I,ll be having this again.
Just serve with rice or Naan, it was deliciousREVI was a bit doubtful that all the rave reviews could be right  but they were!  A very, very nice dal.  I used puy lentils so the cooking time more than doubled and the cauliflower was overcooked.  I hardly ever follow recipes exactly but with this one I did and personally wouldn''t change a thing.

I reduced the red peppers I used cayenne to just a dash because I was worried that it would be too spicy, but the spices mellow a lot during cooking.

Thank you very much.REVThese were good and had a nice flavor to them. I followed the recipe exactly as written but I too used frozen already chopped potatoes.REVThese were great. I followed your recipe exactly and we thought the spicing was perfection. Thanks for sharing this one!REVCubed the potatoeseveryone loved them!!! REVI used a 1 lb. frozen organic hash brown mix from my freezer and halved the rest of the ingredients.  I chose this recipe because I had everything available on my kitchen shelf and was low fat to boot.  I allowed my hashed browns to defrost quite a bit before cooking, used a small casserole dish, substituted cayenne pepper powder for red pepper, and cooked for recommended length of time.  This made the top nice and brown, and under layers soft.  Served with extra hot sauce, yum!  Easy, quick, and healthful!REVExcellent Hash Browns! These turned out great and tasted even better! Thanks Malarkey Test....REVThese hash browns are to die for!!!  I am on a very low carb diet and just one bite and I kept eating them against my will!  Spicy enough that my husband liked them and not so spicy that my little boy scarfed them down as well.  VERY GOOD RECIPE!!!!REVThese were excellent although they weren''t as spicy as I thought they would be.  For us, they could be spiced up quite a bit and this recipe is so easy that we were able to do so with no problem.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!REVI cheated and used frozen cubed potatoes and the same spices and they were really tasty. Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will make them again.');

It was so easy to make.  I didn''t use the raisins.  While it was baking the whole house smelled like apples.  This will be added to my favorites.  Thank you for a great recipe.REVI found the pie to be very good.  I did accidently, on purpose, omit the 34 cup surgar.  Just sounded like too much sugar.  It would have taken the guess work out of it if the baking time had been included in the recipe.  I also, baked for about 45 miunutes.  I would bake again.   And again, would leave out the 34 cup of sugar.REVeveryone LOVED this.  it''s very sweet even though i, too, omitted the extra 34 cup sugar.  i did not have fresh nutmeg, but used organic, and the spice mixture was wonderful.  it''s great as a dessert with whipped cream, or as a nice breakfast with tea.  the directions do not mention where to add the butter, i just mixed it in with the other wet ingredients before blending with the dry.  thank you so much for posting this!  i will be making for Thanksgiving this year!REVloved it!!!

But over all awesome dish!REVthis was wonderful warm with cream for sweets tonight. i left out the peacans as my family doesnt appreciate nuts but they really loved this piecake  many thanks for a delious recipeREVThe flavor of this was good, but the making of it didn''t go very well.  There were a lot of steps, which isn''t necessarily a  bad thing, but it didn''t fall together like most cake recipes.  For example, I couldn''t figure out why I had to melt the butter and of course cool it when I was just creaming it, or why add the sugar in two parts.   I had tons of tunnels.  And it would be helpful if there was a number for how long to bake.  At least a range, especially for us novice cooks.   It took 45 minutes for me.REVthis  was a real hit, i also omitted the 34 cup of sugar and the raisins. i also used chopped almonds instead of pecans, cause that is was i had on hand. i will make it again.');

It was great served with pasta.REVI give this recipe a good to high rating because it just tastes good and is realitivly easy to make.  I used Cream Sherry as I didn''t have any Marsala, and it turned out really good.

It has a wonderful, rich flavour and is equally nice for a brush on sauce on the grill or a slow cook method.  I added a small drop of liquid smoke flavour and extra garlic.  I''ve made this many times since I first found the recipe and everyone LOVES it.  Use it on any meat, it''s great!REVWhat flavor!  Used on chicken and my son grabbed what was left of the sauce to take home.  Can''t wait to try this on ribs now.  Made for the Comfort Cafe, a tag game.REVOutstanding!  The only change I made was add 2 Tblsp water rather than add 1 Tblsp water to dry mustard.  Didn''t have expresso so made a strong pot of coffee and added that.  Fabulous flavor  deep and rich.  We''re going to have this one alot.  Thanks!REVI''ve used this on chicken and ribs now and it always gets rave reviews.    This is one of the few recipes I wouldn''t dare to tweak   its great just the way it is!REVMade this sauce to go on some bbq chicken.  Everone loved it!  Thanks Queen Dragon Mom.  AnnREVEveryone loved it! I have to admit that barbecue sauce with coffee just didn''t sound right, but we needed barbecue sauce and had all the right ingredients for this one. WOW! The whole family was raving over the barbecue sauce and wanted to know the brand and store where we bought it! Even grandma, who was sure that it would be too spicy for her, asked for more to dip her barbecued ribs into. Thanks for sharing the recipe!REVThis is a great sauce!  The only change I made was to substitute apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  Next time I think I''m going to mix in chipotle powder with the chili powder for a smokey kick.REVThis sauce is amazing. I have been looking for a recipe for a sauce similar to the sauce served at my favorite hometown rib joint. This is the closest thing I have found. I followed the recipe and only added 14 cup of bourbon.REVThis was an excellent sauce! I did cut it in half and still have some left for next time. It was really tangy and BH really liked it. He was the one who braved the cold and went outside to cook it on the grill after I had marinaded two ribs for about an hour. I gave him some extra sauce to baste with and all turned out well. The time it took to prepare and the long list of ingredients used was well worth it. I may even try this during the winter as a slow roast or even a crockpot recipe for ribs as I still have quite a few of them in the freezer.REVVery nice flavored bbq sauce!  We enjoyed it on our ribs and chicken.REVI lerterally just made this sauce before I read this post. I made coffee bbq sauce and googled it and this is the exact same ingredients minus I added home made hot sauce. Mind blown');

I''d already used all the ingredients in the cake, and hadn''t set aside anything to use to make a glaze. While it smelled fabulous while baking, and had a moist, dense texture, the flavor didn''t measure up. I did substitue unsalted butter for the margarine, and generic almonds instead of Dole brand but I would think the butter would have made it better, not worse. I did make my own glaze, which was fine, but it really didn''t help the cake.REVYum! This cake was gone in no time. It was really light and moist.I used butter. I cut the sugar down to 1c and  I also didn''t make a glaze for it and it was delicious and sweet enough for us. My boyfriend went out and bought more bananas for me to make it again!');

I used just under 8 oz of mushrooms, but left out the celery don''t care for it, used green onions, used parmesan flavored breadcrumbs, and sauteed in olive oil, rather than butter.  Baked for 7 minutes at 400 degrees.  They were delicious, but a bit salty probably the parmesan.  So easy and delicious!REVI added garlic and small pieces of shrimp to mine.  We loved them!REVExcellent mushrooms without a lot of work.  Great savory flavoring that is perfect without cheese in fact, cheese might ruin this recipe in my opinion.  Both my husband and I devoured these.  I used an 8 oz package of cremini mushrooms, which we thought were great, but don''t know if there might be better ones to choose from?  I cooked them for about 10 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Agree with others that this is a great lighttasting recipe.  Will definitely repeat!REVIt was easy to make, but the stuffing was mediocre.  Not bad, but not super.REVWe enjoyed this.  It was a nice light recipe, instead of one piled with calories.  Definitely make again.REVI made these a while ago and forgot to rate them then. I remember thinking I wouldn''t make them again.REVWe add fresh sausage and cheater ,Also sauteed in 1teasp bacon dipping . Totally awesome.REVWas looking for recipe that did not have cheese in it and this hit the spot.  So easy to make and very good. Thanks for posting.REVVery Tasty and a nice change from having cheese in every recipe. They took 12 minutes in the oven  Iput a piece of foil over the top for the first 5 minutes. The mushrooms were very thick.. I cut the recipe back to 6 mushrooms. Thanks AnnJoy for a recipe that I''ll enjoy as an appetizer and for Sunday BrunchREVAppreciated the package size designation rather than the number of mushrooms.  Used green onions rather than regular onions, and substituted dill for oregano.  I usually butter the cookie sheet rather than grease it.  Tasty!REVI made these for our family New Year''s Eve party. What a hit. They were really super tasting and very easy to make. I did make just a little revision since we always have a big crowd. I doubled the recipe and added to the filling 2 Tbs Grated Parmesan Cheese and 2 cans of well drained Crabmeat. This filled 212oz pkgs of mushroom caps. Thanks for the great recipe!!REVVery good recipe!  It taste terrific!REVI served these at my wine tasting party  mushrooms are great to mix with a red wine.  One of the hits of the party!  With all of the food I was serving, it was nice to have a lighter appetizer vs the typical sausage and cheese stuffing.  Quick and easy, and the house smelled great while they were cooking.  I doubled the recipe and only had 3 or 4 left over.  A definite repeat!');

I left out the pork, eggs, carrot, water chestnut, and black fungus.  It was delicious.  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and did not find the soup thick at all.

Next time I''ll try to find golden needles and black fungus, and then maybe open a Chinese restaurant!  

Thanks for a great recipe that I''ll be sharing with family and friends!REVI made this recipe exactly how it is written except omitting the tofu, and it turned out pretty good. I really like the restaurant version of hot  sour soup, and this had a little different taste, but VERY close! I think the ingredients that threw the flavor off was the mushrooms. I used canned shiitake  straw mushroom only way I could find them and was not impress with the flavor  texture it gave. Next attempt will be with fresh button mushrooms...which I''ve had at a couple Chinese restaurants. Thanks so much!!REVThis was an awesome recipe.  I was looking for something that replicated a soup that my fiance and I had in Hong Kong and with a few additions this recipe was perfect.  Used more broth and less cornstarch.  Added cilantro, bean sprouts, half the chili paste, and used regular mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms.  Next time I think I will make it thicker and possibly add noodles in place of tofu.  My fiance is already begging me to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe Nancy!REVWe really enjoyed this soup. My 15yo daughter has been jonesing for Hot  Sour soup so off I went to find a recipe. My 14 LOVED it, the grownups did too! I used 2 eggs, all dried mushrooms which I hydrated, added both chicken and tofu. I was not thick from the corn starch or too salty or too tangy from the vinegar. It was a golden brown color and very appealing.  Super good on day 2 for lunch! It''s a winner all the way around. Thanks for sharing Nancy!REVAWESOME !!!!! I will never buy  hot  sour soup  from  a  restaraunt  again !
i added some wasabi bean sauce  and japanese  pepper pods  to  heat  it  up  a bit more but   apart  from  that it  was SPOT ONREVThis is a GREAT recipe. Super easy to make, and tastes better than the soup in most of the chinese restaurants Ive been to!REVVery good !! I didn''t have chili  paste so used 2 large cloves of garlic and a heaping 12 tsp. of Italian pepper seeds. That was just the right amount of heat for us. 1 rounded Tbsp. of cornstarch was perfect. Did use about 12 tsp. of pepper but will omit it next time. The bite was harsh. I will also omit the egg. I don''t believe it adds to the flavor and the broth would be much more appealing to the eye without it. Did garnish with chopped Cilantro. It added a nice flavor and additional color.REVTakes a bit of time to make, but it is one of the greats for hot and sour.REVThis was outstanding.  I reduced a few ingredients 1 tb chile sauce, 12 pkg of tofu, 3 tb cornstarch and 3 eggs.  And I didn''t use the fungus.  It was fabulous and surprisingly easy  I have saved this in my favorites!REVAbsolutely delicious!  Relying on some of the other reviews, I used only 1 tsp. of cornstarch and 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste, and when tastetesting it was not spicy enough my family likes strong taste so I ended up using 2 tbsp paste as the recipe said.  I also increased the soy to 3 tbsp and used 13 cup rice vinegar in place of 14 cup white vinegar.  I also used lowsodium soy sauce, which worked fine.  This was wonderful, flavorful and very authentictasting.  Thanks for a great recipe!REVOk so this is an ok recipe I added some stuff and mine tastes like it came from a restaurant black fungus lily flower buds and a few other things and it perfectREVI can''t believe I have never left a rating on this absolutely fabulous recipe.  I''ve made it for years and everyone just raves over it. The recipe has been passed out numerous times. It is the BEST hot and sour soup I have ever had and that includes in Chinese restaurants.  It is my go to recipe, period. 
We like it hot so I used 3 tablespoons of the garlicchili sauce. I omitted the carrots and used 2 beaten eggs instead of the more healthy egg substitute. Regarding the cornstarch, I just keep adding the slurry until it looks to be the right consistency.  Everything else is as the recipe recommends....including the black fungus...or wood ear mushrooms. 
Thanks so much, Nancy.REVI just finished making this for dinner tonight and just had to taste it.  What a flavor sensation. I didn''t see where it said to add the carrots so I put them in with the bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts.   I used 1 T  garlic red chili sauce, 14 c. egg substitute and only had button mushrooms and dried shitake and  also no tofu.   This is one dynamite hot and sour soup.  I can''t wait until I have all the correct ingredients.  This is great as I made it though.REVIt was just what we were looking for!  I didn''t have some of the mushrooms and skipped the tofu but it was great!  We''ll definitely be making this recipe again.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, we cut back the Chili to 1.5 tbsp and it was just the right heat.REVOh. My. This is the holy grail of Hot and Sour Soup. Fried up a batch of wonton strips and everybody had seconds. This is a definite keeper.REVWhen I visited China I ate a lot of hot and sour soup, mostly because I could be more sure of the ingredients!  This is the closest I''ve found to the taste of the soup there, better than any restaurant soup I''ve tried.  I make it with extra garlic chile mix and no meat.  Only problem is, I haven''t found dried black fungus.  Maybe it would be even better?REVWe love to order hot and sour soup in the restaurant, so I was a bit leary of trying this at home.  I knew my family would be tough to please when it came to this soup.  I read through the instructions and thought I will try it.  I am so glad I did....this is so good.  I used my homemade chicken stock, and instead of straw mushrooms I used button mushrooms what I had on hand, otherwise followed your recipe exactly.  We really loved this and I plan on making this quite often when we make a chinese style meal.  Thank you so much for posting this.REVI''m so happy to have found this soup!  I happily used 2 T of garlic chili sauce  I like my lips to be a little numb when I finish my Hot and Sour Soup!  I only used 1 egg and didn''t have any dried black fungus.  I also used about 8 oz of tofu and that was plenty for us.  My husband and son were so impressed, they figured the local Chinese restaurant could use me for a chef. Thanks for posting!REVgreat flavor  I made it fully vegan so omitted the pork and egg and used vegetarian base.  I would def. tone down the heat a bit for most audiences.  I love the spice but it was even hot for me.REVI was unable to find the black fungi but the recipe turned out GREAT! I''ve tried dozens of recipes and none can compare to this one. It''s a keeper.REVSpot on!REVI am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I thought with all the positive reviews here it would be restaurantquality. Boy was I wrong!I followed this recipe exactly, omitting the water chestnut and carrots, but I still found it too bitter. I would back off on the vinegar but I can''t think of any other way to improve this recipe. It was just plain awful! I will pay 1 for a cup of awesome authentic hot  sour at my local Chinese restaurant from now on.REVWonderful recipe with the modifications others have suggested less chili paste, cornstarch, egg a slight bit more vinegar  I used rice vinegar. I also reduced the soy sauce to 1 T. Also, to make things even easier, I use canned straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots and baby corn, and reconstituted shiitake mushrooms. I also omitted the pork and water chestnuts. If I have more time, I like to add the black fungus, and tiger lily buds golden needles.REVJust as good as any Chinese restaurant soup!  Excellent flavor and overall taste!REVExcellent !REVBelieve everything. I made this soup a week ago and I''m about to make it again, so I thought I would post. Excellent soup. I''m not much of a cook so I just went through the comments and modified the recipe to my liking based on what others said. I was very impressed with the way it turned out, will make often.REVVery good recipe. I enjoyed the spiciness very much, as my family is used to eating very spicy Indian dishes. However, if you are not into extremely spicy foods, I suggest reducing the chili paste.

SashwatREVGreat recipe for anyone who like it as close as it come to the real thing! Very simple to make and you can find all the ingredents in your local supermarket! I myself would cut back on the white pepper and add a little bit of hot oil not to much! I would also add about 1 12 tbls more of vineger. or to taste add a little more meat and you can serve with a bowl of white rice with steamed veggies for a meal of its own.REVmy family like the bamboo shoots whole. but we love your recipeREVMy boyfriend and i were very pleased with this recipe. he is half chinese so he knows the good stuff. the only thing we changed was the amount of chili paste. we only put one tablespoon instead of 2. the soup is very very spicy with 2 tblsp''s. other than that it was great. the flavor is awesome. my boyfriend said that it tasted just like his mom''s. that is a great compliment.
amityREVLoved it!REVthis was pretty good on the whole. a few things the cornstarch was waaay too much and it made the soup unbearably thick, less soupy and more mealie. i''ll probably use just three tablespoons next time, perhaps less. the two tablespoons of chili sauce were also too much, just one would suffice. otherwise, the recipe is good. i omitted the pork and used less egg. i couldn''t find black fungus so used dried wild mushrooms which worked out just fine. the soup is very filling and will have your scalp sweating by the time you''re done.REVWith a few adjustments this is the best I have ever made.  I''ve searched far and wide for a good recipe, and here it is.  I added two additional cups of broth.  Used 2 tablespoons of corn starch, two eggs, and a splash more vinegar.  I agree that using the two tablespoons of chili sauce makes it really really hot, but I like it that way.  Served it with sticky rice.  It was tremendous.  What a find.  Thanks for posting this recipe.REVThis recipe is the bomb!  This is the closest to the restaurant kind that I''ve ever encountered.  It has a permanent home in my personal recipe box now.  As said in earlier posts, I would definitely only recommend using 1 Tbsp. of the chili sauce instead of 2 Tbsp.  Also, only 4 Tbsp. of the corn starch is needed.  Otherwise, it''ll congeal pretty quickly.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone seeking the real thing.REVI found this to be just great!  I cut the recipe in half, and I took some of the others'' advice and reduced the cornstarch for half the recipe I only used 1 Tbsp.  I also did not use the black fungus, used rice vinegar instead of white, and only used 1 egg.  This tasted like I was eating it at a restaurant...I served it with steamed dumplings and Pad Thai as the main course.REVKick ass!  I love hot and sour soup and I could live on it!  This recipe is oooh la la. 

Here''s what I did different  halfed the amount of garlic and chili paste and that''s saying a lot bc I love me some HOT stuff, and halfed the amount of cornstarch.  I doubled the amount of soy, vinegar and sesame oil.  I also increased the egg and tofu amount a tiny bit bc I excluded the yolks in half the eggs I used and I love tofu.  USE YOUR OWN VARIATION AND ENJOY  IT DOESN''T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!!REVExcellent recipe, however I used only one egg  cut back on the corn starch. I''ve also used canned chinese stirfry vegetables bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, mushrooms  bean sprouts  frozen shrimp in this soup for variation  ease.REVWOW!  This really IS the BEST!!!!  I took others advice, and only used 1 Tbsp. of the chili paste, and it was more than enough.  I don''t like tofu, so I just used twice as much of the mushrooms.  If you''re looking for the best, this is it!REVWe make this recipe OFTEN! It is the best we''ve ever tasted. Modifications
1.Double recipe and freeze it.
2. Leave out eggs until ready to eat.
3. Black pepper instead of white.
4. Use only 5 TBSP cornstarch in doubled recipe.
5. Leave out bamboo shoots.
6. Use whatever kind of mushrooms are available. Usually a mix of several kinds.
7. Rice vinegar instead of white.
8. Leave out black fungus.REVWith a few adjustments, this is about perfect.  Like others, I found 1 tbsp. of garlic and red chile paste provided plenty of punch and 2 tbsp. cornstarch was right.  I used 4 eggs, but next time I''ll use two.  The vegetables can be varied at will.  I used Golden Needles, but no fungus and regular mushrooms instead of the straw.  We did not care for water chestnuts in the soup and I wouldn''t use them next time.  And there WILL be a next time, because I am now done looking for the Hot and Sour Soup of my dreams.REVTastse surpasses any found in Chinese restaurant!  Presents well.  Simple to make.
I cut hot pepper by 50, omitted the pork.  Am striving to reduce the sodium.REVThis is the first time I''ve left a review.  Could not resist because this soup was so good.  I always order Hot  Sour soup at chinese restaurants, it''s my favourite.  And I''ve tried to make it from scratch several times unsuccessfully.  This recipe was easy and the ultimate Hot  Sour soup.  I will never look further for a recipe.  The changes I made were to use 1.5 tbsp of chili paste I like spice but would reduce further if not used to it, 2 eggs and 3 tbsp of cornstarch, no pork, no straw mushrooms and substituted dried porcini mushrooms for the dried black fungus. Next time I''d try to find the dried black fungus and cut the water chestnuts into smaller pieces. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.REVI just made this soup.........I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  It is soooo good!  I made it as stated in the recipe except I only put 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste.  This is even better than any hot sour soup I''ve had at Chinese restaurants!  Thanks for this keeper!REVI made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.I cut the chili paste in half,used less cornstarch , 2 eggs and substituted chicken for pork. It had enough heat, but each person could add more chili sauce if desired. I will make this again.REVI made this as it is listed.  I really enjoyed it and will make it again soon.REVWay too hot!  Cut the chili paste dramatically if you don''t want to burn your lips!  I ruined the whole batch by following the directions exactly.  I wish I had followed the other reviewers'' advice!REVAlso loved this recipe.  Cut back on the eggs used 3 and omitted pork and tofu.  Added a splash more vinegar an used reconstituted shiitake''s.  Yum!  Perfect for killing a cold.REVI apologize for taking so long to review this recipe as I have made this now at least 3 times. I did make some changes but only because we like our soup not quit as thick as what this recipe calls for. Therefore I used 4 tbs of cornstarch and 2 eggs. I did not think that the chili sauce needed to be adjusted. We all agreed that it had just the right amount of heat. My daughter enjoys this so much that she now fixes a big pot of it on the weekends minus all the meat and veggies and eats it for lunch through out the week. This is a prize recipe.');

I got my fix. Thanks for posting Carole Reu!!REVThis turned out really good and was a big hit with our resident chocolate lovers at Christmas dinner.  A couple notes I made it the night before and left it in the fridge overnight. I used 4 egg yolks instead of 3 in the filling and 1 milk. The finished pie had a little bit of syrupy liquid in it. Apparently this is from the meringue and is completely normal, it did not change the taste of the pie at all. I also used a store bought graham cracker pie crust which worked just fine. It set almost immediately and cut into real slices. Great recipe.REVI didn''t put the Meringue on top of the pie because we don''t like it, but make it as a Chocolate Cream Pie...  We LOVED this pie!  Thick and rich chocolate.  Perfect with some Cool Whip on top... Yum!REVMy only problem with this recipe is that I now have to try really hard to not be a little snot when someone else makes a chocolate pie I want to tell them their pie is alright but my new recipe is so much better. WOW!! 10 stars! I like pie, but I love this one, and it is now the pie I have to make for every event because it039s just too good to pass up an opportunity to eat it. So rich and thick. Had no trouble getting it to set up. Very easy to make if you039re handy with a whisk. I was careful to add the mixture to my yolks very gradually. And keeping my whites refrigerated seemed to help the meringue set up better. I039ve made it with and without crust and love it both ways.REVThe filling is good but my mirange didn039t set up. I followed the instructions.REVPie shell...how about it,do you have directions for it or only for fillingREVI loved this pie just as it is written because I prefer something denser that I can actually cut into a pretty slice and my spoon still goes right through. But my husband preferred his grandmother''s version understandable, and she only uses a 13 cup of flour and does not bring it to a boil, just to the point of thickening. She also said that she forgot all about adding any salt. Hers tastes great, but it did not cut into actual slices.REVThis didn''t turn out good for me either, same as Katybird.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made sure to stir continuously using a wooden spoon in a nonstick pan on medium heat and I couldn''t even let it come to a boil as it was thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan.  So I went ahead and put half into a bowl with the egg yolks stirred well return egg mixture to pan, still stirring continuously it was starting to smooth out but then before it could reach boiling point, it started thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan again and cramping my hand.  Please give me suggestions as to what may have caused this or how to prevent that from happening should I try and make it again in the future.  Thanks, ReginaREVJust wasn''t chocolatey enough for us ... It just wasn''t as good as I anticipated.REVThe recipe has turned out great for me. The taste is chocolaty rich!!! First time at baking a chcolate pie without using a boxed pudding. Loved it. Easy to follow recipe too. Thank you.REVLoved this pie the flavor was just what I was looking for.  DH wanted a chocolate Meringue Pie and this fit the bill.  My only problem and it''s probably my technique as I''m new to this was that it wasn''t firm enough to hold it''s shape when cut.  I''m thinking maybe I didn''t cook it long enough but will be making this again and I''m sure perfection will come with practice.  That said the flavor of the rich chocolate can''t be beat.  Thanks Carole for a wonderful recipe.REVwhen i made this pie,i forgot to add the butter and vanilla,just didn''t read very carefully,and i didn''t know if i should have baked the pie crust before adding the mixture.i put the filling in the crust and baked it for about 10 minutes took it out and let it cool a little bit then put the meringue on top,the pie turned out just GREAT i can''t believe that anyone hasn''t rated before now.the only reason that i rated it a four is because of the confusion with the crustREVMade it this morning but used my own meringue recipe.The pie was gorgeous,not overly sweet,very creamy but firm enough to set beautifully.My husband a confirmed chocaholic gave a satisfied groan as he tasted it!
Really easy, I recommend it.REVChocolate lovers you gotta try this one!  This pie is so rich and chocolatey.  It more than satisfied my chocolate fix.REVThis was easy and excellent. The chocolate part is a dense, rich pudding, not fluffy. I used 12 tsp of white vinegar since I didn''t have cream of tartar.REVI have recommended this recipe and would like to add this was by far the easiest chocolate pie I''ve made.

Very rich but so delicious.  We made this for Christmas Eve and it was gone in no time.  I will be making this many times over.  Thank you for this yummy recipe.....StephanieREVGreat, I added green onions and used pepperjack cheese to make it spicier.REVMt husband loved this recipe! I doubled the recipe which turned out fine. It also reheated well the next day. Next time I will use bread for dipping.REVYummy! We made this with french bread and ate the whole thing!REVThis was amazing.  My DH and I had this for dinner a few nights ago.  We ended up eating it only and the entire bowl!!  He couldn''t stop talking about how great and creamy it was.  I am doubling the recipe and taking it to a birthday football party today.  GO COLTS!REVVery good! I doubled it and halved the lemon juice...I am glad I did because I think it would have been overpowering. I added extra Worcestershire and cheddar, some Old Bay, some cayenne pepper and white pepper. I don''t know if it''s raveworthy but it is definitely good dip! I used reduced fat cream cheese and mayo.REVLove this, and have made it several times.REVI made this dip for New Year''s Eve.  Added some old bay, onion powder, pepper, and extra worcestershire sauce to give it a little punch.  I used about 34 lb. of fresh backfin crabmeat.I didn''t like it hot!  Right out of the oven, it seemed bland.  HOWEVER, after sitting in the refrigerator overnight, I decided to spread it on club crackers just because I didn''t want to waste it.  Oh how wonderful it is as a cold spread!!!   I ate the whole thing in two days time!!  Who knows, maybe slightly heating it at this point, with the flavors all mingled, it might be good hot.  I will remember this as a wonderful cold spread!REVSomething about this dip just didn''t work for us.  It lacked a bit on flavor and was too sourtangy.  I''d have to tweak it a bit to suit our tastes.  It went largely untouched at our last gathering.REVI made this yesterday to take to Christmas Eve dinner at my inlaws.  It was really good and everyone really liked it.  I followed the directions exactly except I used 2 cans of lump crab meat and didn''t have any dry or even dejon mustard, so I subbed a squirt of yellow mustard.  I probably used quarter cup of cheese in the dip and another 12 cup on top.  I took a bag of pita chips to dip and kept going back for more!  I am going to make this again for my new years eve party!  Thanks for great recipe!REVThis was GREAT!!! Even dear old Dad
who hates dips said he could make a meal of this.  The only thing I did different was to use a little fresh garlic and fresh lime juice didn''t have lemon on hand.  Thanks of a wonderful appy recipe!REVThis is Delicious and really good!  Only thing I did different was to use 2 6oz. cans pink crabmeat, no lemon juice, milk, or cheddardon''t like it.  I sprinkled top with Old Bay.  This tastes good even cold!!!REVI loved this dish. My dear old dad found it on here and made it for my boyfriend and I for supper. It was so delicious! Dad likes it better the next day after it has chilled in the refrigerator over night and all of the flavors have blended. Served hot or cold its a hit!REVWith all these great reviews I hate to be the one who has something negative to say, but my family and I didn''t really care for this recipe as written.  I doubled the recipe, and didn''t use the cheddar cheese, that was the only change I made, and we all thought it was very bland.  Before baking, I added a lot of old bay maybe a ts or 2 and hot sauce maybe 3 or 4 Tb and we finially liked it.  I mixed it up the day before, and baked it covered for an hour, then uncovered for 20 minutes, with a little old bay sprinkled on top.  After those changes it was fantastic.  Thanks for posting anyway, I doubt I''ll ever make crab dip any other way.REVWhat a waste of crab!  Way too tangy flavor that drowns out the crab. Yuch!REVI made a slight variation on this that turned out amazing. I added diced red peppers and green onion I then drizzled it with cocktail sauce ... I was told it was BANGING... Great recipe ThanksREVThis has been my goto recipe for the past 6 years! It''s the perfect accompaniment to crab...not too overpowering. Good bread is necessary! The only two additions I make are 2 tbsp grated onion mixed in with everything else and a sprinkling of Old Bay or J.O.''s on the top before baking. NOTE If you pick the crabs yourself and they have been steamed in Old Bay, DO NOT add the old bay or garlic salt or it gets WAY TOO SALTY! If you want to freeze to save for another night, be sure to bake it but not for the whole timecloser to 2025 minsthen you can reheat in the microwave or toaster. If you don''t cook it it ends up separating. I usually split the recipe and have half that night and half the next weekend. Enjoy!REVI tripled this recipe. I used the imitation crab meat as it was 18.00 a pound for crabmeat and you can only buy it by the pound I did not want to spend 36.00 on one ingredient. My daughter tasted it the morning I took it out of the oven and told me, Mom, they are going to LOVE this.  Sure enough they did. I took it to monthly birthday celbration at 800 AM by 855 AM it was GONE! People were eating it like it was a cassarole. I didn''t even get to taste it! It was fantastic, evidently!!!I a ton of emails asking for the recipe. I followed the recipe to a tee except that I put probably twice as much cheese as the recipe called for.REVThis was delicious and super simple to make. However, I felt like it was missing something. Maybe I''ll add some Old Bay next time. Thanks for sharing.REVGreat recipe. I got this recipe from an old freind from Maryland back in the early eighties. Her husband was a crabber and knew what tasted good. Still a great tasting dip!REVGreat tasting dip!  My DW whipped it up and we just about fell into the dish fighting to get there first!  Served it with some rippled potato chips and bagel chips.  It''s a real treat for us!REVI prepared this dip ahead of time and baked it while everyone was in the kitchen enjoying all the snacks at my party. Soon the whole place smelled wonderful and they ate it right up and couldn''t stop raving about it! Thanks for the great recipe!REVFantastic and easy!  I added Old Bay and substituted fresh grated Asiago cheese, then used low fat mayo, sour cream, and cream cheese.  I will definitely make this again!REVThis was very good. Mine didn''t set up very well until after it had cooled. However, nobody seemed to mind because it tasted great!REVA quintessential party dip  creamy, cheesy, and crabby! I used backfin crab meat in mine. Such a snap to prepare and everyone loved it.REVThis is very tasty.  It tastes great right out of the oven, but the leftovers were even better the next day after being warmed up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!REVOh, MYmymymymymymy..... This could become a VERY dangerous addiction! I made this for my husband and his friends who stopped by yesterday and they couldn''t shut up about it.   I took my portion to the living room where I could feast upon it in peace and make barelysubdued moaning noises and euphoric facial expressions without being gossiped about later. Anyway, I used backfin crab and it seemed a little fishy, so next time I''ll go for higher quality. I used a preshredded cheddar and for the milk, used 12 and 12. Everything else I did as indicated. The combination of ingredients was just wonderful and I can''t wait to make this again.  Thank you to Lee and crabplace.com!REVMade this for a baby shower and it was a HUGE HIT! I didn''t have worcester sauce so I used a couple dashes of soy sauce, also I didn''t mely cheese on the top, but I did mix it all in and it turned out wonderful! It was one of the first things to go.REVI made this for my family during the Superbowl. They loved it and it was a festive addition to the usual snacks. We had leftovers and it was just as yummy cold. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making it again.REVA nice basic recipe for warm crab dip. We added some chopped artichokes and served with whole wheat crackers. I wish I had added some Old Bay, it would have added a nice kick. I did add a few drops of Tabasco sauce. Yummy!REVVery tasty crab dip!  I liked the flavor added by the Worcestershire sauce.  It was good cold too.REVI absolutely loved this recipe. I added some finely chopped green onions and used fresh pressed garlic.  The worcestershire sauce added a wonderful flavor for this delicious dip.  I made it twice this weekend and it was gone within 30 minutes after it came out of the oven!  THank you so much for posting this!REVThis crab dip was an absolute hit
I made this for a barbaque this labor day it was so easy and fast to prepare.  I subsituted the dry  mustard for regular mustard and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt I also added extra cheese and crab meat was a hit everone wanted this recipe. I want to say thanks for making me look so good.   
REVA BIT HIT!!!! This is absolutely fantastic. I made this for Thanksgiving guest and served with different types of gourmet crackers. Everyone kept saying how wonderful this was. Needless to say it went fast. I doubled the ingredients to make twice as much and all the measurements worked fine. I did add a little more cheddar cheese to the dip...just about 2 more TBSP because I love cheese and apparently so does everyone else. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!REVThis taste great!!!!!! Even my 3yr. old loved itREVOutstanding dip for chips, but especially broc and cauliflower...My coworkers got most of it, but not before I at least got a decent taste. Thanx for a great recipe !REVGood stuff. Very good stuff.REVVery good and EASY to make.  This was a big hit with everyone.  A few of them even said, it was the best crab dip they ever tasted!!!REVmade this for superbowl sunday  everyone RAVED about how wonderful it was!!!  several people even asked for the recipe.  positively THE BEST crab dip I have ever had!!!!!  A new staple in my recipe book!!!!REVAbsolutely fantastic!!  I had to use prepackaged crab meat as fresh was unavailable, and it turned out great!  When it finished cooking, I put in into a hollowed out bread loaf french bread, and used the left over bread cut up as dipping pieces  WOW!!  This was a hit with my guests!  I will definately make this again.REVThis has replaced my staple crab dip and I may not make it again.REVThis was excellent.  I made for a work pot luck and it was scarfed down in no time.  I used imitation crab meat , fresh minced garlic and substituted TexMex cheese for the cheddar.  I will make this again for sure.  Easy and delicious.REVI used 12 imitation crab and 12 salad sized shrimp and added some old bay seasoning for some spice. I made a casserole dish of it for a pot luck party,it was gone! all of it, there were people eating as sandwiches they liked it so much!REVThis was really good.  I used a pound of crabmeat and it was delicious.  Next time I will add some finely chopped onions.
JudiREVQuick,easy and delicious!REVThis is the best crab dip. The only substitution I made was to use 12 t. minced garlic and regular salt. Yummy and I served with assorted crackers. My family and I give it top honors. Thanks for sharing this.REVThis crap dip recipe has replaced our spinach con queso for a while! This was so good with big wheat crackers. Everything about it was great! Nice ans salty too! The way a dip should be!REVThe kids  I had this for supper last night, using fresh broccoli for dipping. I had to use 2 cans of drained crab meat 4.25oz each, which made the texture a bit weird, but the flavor was divine. I look forward to someday making this with fresh crabmeat. The combo with the broccoli flavor was a good one, but I might try celery next time to get more of the solo dip flavor.REVThis was wonderful, and so easy to make I could almost do it with my eyes closed! I tried to keep this lower fat to stay close to my diet, so I used fatfree mayo, fatfree cream cheese, and fatfree cheddar in this, and it still tasted fantastic! I did go ahead and mix all the cheese into the dip before heating since fatfree cheese doesn''t like to melt on top but will when it is stirred into a dish. It warmed up very nicely and was great on crackers! Thanks for a great recipe!REVMy girlfriend has a source of fresh crab on a regular basis and since I have found recipezaar she phones me weekly and we always chat about the new crab recipes that I have found before the conversation is over. Thankfully she also shares because this sounds wonderful.REVThanks for the wonderful recipe! I used fresh Dungeness crab and everyone loved it! This recipe is definitely a keeper!REVThis was gone in a matter of minutes on xmas eve.  I too used imitation crab meat, and it tasted like the real deal!  I baked a loaf of french bread for dipping, yummy!REVExcellent crab dip. Rich and creamy. The worcestershire really adds to the flavor. We spread this on our favorite crackers and that was our dinner. Yummy!! Appreciate the recipe.REVI can''t believe how many reviews this dip has gotten, so I had to try it myself.  It disappeared before my very eyes!  I would definitely add diced onions, more garlic, and some cayenne or something to give it a kick...REVI needed another dip for a party that I was having and I made this one.  It was a big hit and my party guests kept talking about it all night. REVAmazing crab dip! I served this as sort of a side dish with some broiled shrimp and we really enjoyed the flavor. I didn''t change a thing, it isn''t necessary. Thanks for posting.REVAfter all the great reviews this has received, I was expecting an out of this world dip.  However, I was very disappointed with the final result when I prepared this.  It came out really soupy and was very greasy...I''m not sure why as I only lightly greased the casserole.  I might try this again to see if I get different results...if so, I''ll revise my review.  REVThis dip was a big hit during Thanksgiving.  I served it with some toasted bread as an appetizer and my guest just loved it.  I used imitation crab meat instead and it was still GREAT!  REVMade this for a small gathing of friends this past week, and everyone just raved about it.  It was gone in no time, and they were still asking for more!  The only change I made was adding about 34 cup of grated parmesan cheese.  Very, very yumpy....  Thanks for the great recipe!REVGreat recipe!  It went very quickly at my recent dinner party.  I did use 1 clove of garlic, minced, salt, about a tablespoon of minced onion, and a dash of hot pepper sauce.  I didn''t have any milk, but it didn''t seem to need it.  I also added a little extra cheddar cheese.REVThis is a fairly good dip but it needed more flavor and I would have liked it to have been a little hotter.  Maybe I''ll add hot sauce next time as another reviewer suggested.  I did substitute minced garlic for the garlic salt, doubled the recipe, and heated it in my crockpot for about 3 hours.REVI brought this to a hurricane party, and I swear I turned around and it was gone! Everyone ate the dip as fast as I put in on the table! People were ranting and raving about how good it was. Thank you so much for your post!REVThis was a pretty good dip, but I find that it is lacking something and I just don''t know what. The tangysour flavor from the cream cheese,sour cream and lemon juice was certainly overpowering the whole dip. It needed something with a spicy taste, I think, to balance the flavor. Also, The cheese I had melted on topcheddar had a layer of oil from cooking.After it had cooled a little the whole top layer of cheese came off in one piece. Maybe next time if I remake itI will mix all the cheese in to the main mix. Other than those small flaws it was edible and the flavor of the crab meat really came through.REVthis is the best I''ve had in a long time. just needed a little pinch of red pepper to my taste.');

I did not know for how long to soak my mushrooms, so they may not have soaked long enough before I had to add them to the dish.  At this time, the recipe does not indicate how much or what type of oil to use for cooking the shallots and garlic.  I started with sesame oil and then recooked shallots in vegetable oil and combined the two oils when I tossed and coated the noodles.  I still don''t think I had enough oil to properly coat the noodles, and by this time it was too late to try and flavor my third round of oil, as my meat was all cooked and waiting for my noodles to be added.

REVThese were excellent! I followed exactly as directed and they were perfect. The first batch of phyllo that I bought stuck together, but the 2nd separated easily.Great recipe!REVVery yummy.  I added parsley, dill, and parmesan to the mix.  I also cooked fresh spinach it took a 40 oz bag!.  These are greasy and even started a fire in my oven!  After the first batch I used a jellyroll pan so the butter couldn''t drip off.  There''s no need to rebutter the pan after the first batch.  My hubby accidentally bought fat free cream cheese, which I thought would ruin them, but they turned out fine.  I found the phyllo dough web site to be of great help  www.athens.com  with folding the triangles.  Recipezaar had the better idea of cutting the 2 strips before unrolling, though.  Make sure you keep any dough you''re not immediately working with under a damp towel.  It will be ruined if you don''t.REVI made these for a party and everybody loved them! Folding the triangles was a bit time consuming so I stopped before I used up all the filling. The next day for dinner, I used whole sheets of phyllo and rolled up the leftover filling like burittos.

A Feijoada is made from salted pork cuts feet, tail, ears, ribs, etc jerked beef and at least 2 kinds of sausage cooked on black beans and served aside with white rice, stewed kale, orange, fried pork lard and other which may be different on other regions.

I recommend mixing the shredded cheese in a little not just topping it, only thing I do differently!REVI made this almost as the recipe called for.

The melted muenster cheese really topped it off well.  I think I''ll be making it again this week as we''re getting more squash in our CSA delivery box.  Thanks for posting it!REVThis was my first time making acorn squash, and was looking for a nonsweet, vegetarian recipe. This was the one I went with. The results were ohsogood! Although next time I will follow the recipe more closely, I did have to make a few small changes because in each case I didn''t have fresh onhand I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I soaked and finely chopped, frozen broccoli, and dried basil I also added some dried parsley. I didn''t have walnuts so I had to omit those. I''m a vegan, so instead of using muenster, I used a vegan cheddar cheese that is made by Follow Your Heart, and instead of butter, I used a vegan margerine. The results were still amazing. I will make this again, next time with allfresh ingredients. REVI thought this was great, but made a few minor changes. I used olive oil instead of butter healthier and sharp cheddar instead of muenster cheese. Next time I make it there will be a next time! I would scoop out some of the softened squash and mix it with the filling prior to topping with cheese. It was a nice mix of flavors, and the splash of soy sauce gave it more of a depth of flavor. REVExcellent recipe!  I couldn''t find any muenster cheese so I used aged gouda and it was very tasty.REVThis was great!  I hate to be one of those people but I did have to make a couple of changes since I had to use what was onhand.  I didn039t have broccoli so I substituted about 112 cups of swiss chard, and let me tell you, that was an EXCELLENT choice!  I might actually do this every time.  I also had to use pecans instead of walnuts no big deal and I used a combination of ricotta and mozzarella instead of muenster cheese.  The cheeses were a BIG success as well.

Once again DA!!! kenk, thanks for the recipe!REVI''m sure mine didn''t turn out the way intended, as I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces since I don''t like large bites of potato. Then, on top of doing that, I left them in the water after boiling, until I was ready for them, I knew all along what the result might be, based on the things I was doing lol. I considered posting my result on here as a new recipe, but realized that really, it''s still the same recipe, with a slight variation, so others can choose which way they''re in the mood for, each time they make it. What happened was that as I was mixing everything together, yes, go figure, the potatoes started falling apart. So, I ended up with something between mashed potatoes  potato salad, only far more garlicky, but very good. Oh,  I did add a tad of dried dill, sweet basil  white pepper. My son had wanted hamburgers, but I didn''t want to serve the typical chips, or fries or macaroni  cheese with them, so when I found this recipe I thought it would be a nice fit, a little less plain. I also served it with my Caribbean Coleslaw recipe 290325 which was nice  light which helped balance out the garlic flavor.

Prepared like FoodExplorer. as I have a heavy hand with potatoes, and didn''t want them to mush up.   However, I did not bake them in the oven.

Also, I have tried this with both parsley and cilantro, and I think the cilantro gives it a better taste.REVA great recipe.  When I was in Spain, we ate this all the time at our favorite bar.

We really enjoyed this. It had a great flavor and texture. She recommends using homemade mayonnaise she also recommends using Spanish ingredients when available. Great with a glass of red wine or sangria! Also makes a nice side disha refreshing change from Americanstyle potato salad.REVI really liked this. Instead of boiling the potatoes, I fried them. It was faster this way. They ended up tasting cheesy. I would have never imagines they would taste this good. The reason I''m only giving it a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 is because they were very greasy.REVI loved these!  Such a simple recipe and so much flavor.  Thanks for sharing.REVMmm this was wonderful.  We roasted the potatoes but made the aioli as directed, adding a little bit of lemon juice to lowfat mayonnaise.  The flavour was awesome.

The best Apple Crisp I have ever had!REVJust like my mom always makes.  I am so glad you posted this so I don''t have to do the work adding it!  She does make a few changes though  in oat mixture she only used 4 Tbs butter and puts the extra 2 Tbs in with the apple mixture.  She only uses 4 c apples  I think because we enjoy more topping and doesn''t use lemon juice or walnuts, but I think I will try it next time!  She also uses an 8x8 dish.  Thanks, this recipe is a keeper for sure!REVI couldn''t find my Mom''s recipe for apple crisp, and I knew she wasn''t home yet, so I couldn''t call to get it from her.  So, I found this one, and it''s just as good!  Perfect time of year for apple anything, and the oats and brown sugar go so well together.  I think I could justify eating this for breakfast. Thanks for the recipe. Oh, I used closer to ten apples, but they were on the smallish side.REVI chose this recipe over another because it uses less butter. It was great! I used Granny Smith apples and omitted the walnuts. Topped it with homemade whipped cream and it was just what I wanted. Reminded me of the apple crisp I used to eat as a kid.REVJust what I was looking for.  I try to avoid butter, so I substituted with lowfat yogurt butter and it was fabulous.  Didn''t even miss it. I think it''d be perfect with the contrast of cold vanilla ice cream though.   Will try that next time. REVI can''t believe I forgot to rate this.  I have made this about 30 times already.  Everybody in my family loves it.  Thank you for posting this recipe, it''s saving us money because my husband used to drive to the cheesecake factory everytime he craved an apple crisp.  Now he just asks me to make some for him.REVI was looking for something not quite so sweet to top my apple crisp and this worked perfectly! I added 14 tsp ginger just for fun and liked it a lot. I think I will make the topping up and freeze it to always have on hand for fruit crisps. Thanks!');

For the pecan topping, I didn''t have any dark corn syrup, so I doubled the brown sugar I used dark with a tbl. milk, and vanilla instead of maple flavoring didn''t have that either!.

It is my belief, and only my belief, veggies in a frittata should be crisp tender.  Hope you don''t mind that I took some liberty with this recipe.  I sliced the squash thin and added some green onions and red bell pepper.  Cooked the onion and bell pepper for a few minutes in a lightly buttered cast iron skillet, added the squash and cooked to wilt.  Poured the eggs mixture of egg substitute mixed with 1 tablespoon crme fraiche, black pepper and Italian seasoning over the veggies.  Cooked, lifting egg to allow the uncooked portion to go to the bottom of the pan.  When eggs were almost set, I topped them off with freshly grated parmesan cheese and placed under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  The family enjoyed this served with fresh biscuits.REVMy husband loves squash so he made this for himself today. He also followed PaulaG''s lead and sauteed the squash till crisptender instead of boiling it. It''s also better cut into rings instead of diced small, for texture. He used egg subsitute and omitted the cheese to knock off all that cholesterol, so this was much healthier. This made a delicious satisfying brunch for him.REVThis Yellow Squash Frittata was Yummy!

Thanks!REVI followed the original recipe, but added a grated garlic clove, after reading the reviews.  I enjoyed the moist texture but will add sweet corn kernels to give it more of a hushpuppielike taste.  I will also do a teaspoon size dollop, should cook through more evenly, I think.  A great way to use the plethera of yellow squash I have in my freezer from this summers garden!REVThese are a family favorite!  I also add some cayenne pepper when certain ones will not be eating this... I enjoy the little bounce of flavor... also, use white cornmeal as the meal will not color the yellow squash.  You should try these with a little hand grated cheddar added to the batter... Yummy!REVDelicious! I did take the suggestion of another poster and added some sweet kernel corn. I think that next time, in order to cut back on the fat, I''ll add a little oil to the batter and try to bake these.REVFantastic!  I made these to use up some yellow squash and zucchini.  I made quantity for 6 servings, added a whole can of corn, and a tablespoon of sugar.  Served alongside baked fish sticks.REVMy family loved these things... !  I made them even more delish by using lard. Yes, that four letter word. Try it and I promise the final result will not seem so greasy or heavy after you''ve eaten a dozen!  This recipe should definitely be doubled in order to make a decent amount. I used about 4 medium sized squash to do it and then food processed the squash to make it nice and mashed. Also food processed the onions.REVThis was delicious. It reminded me of hushpuppies. I added alittle celery seed to the batter for alittle extra flavor. 
I thought I made a review for this but don''t see it listed so I am adding another. 
I shared a few puffs with a friend and she just had to have the recipe, she loved them too. This is a keeper!! Thanks for posting a neat way to use squash. REVThese are delicious!  I made them as written but plan on try some of the suggestions of the other reviewers, especially adding southwestern flavors and sweet corn to the batter.  This was an excellent recipe to help me use up the bumper crop of yellow squash coming out of my garden.  Thanks Riffraff br82611Adding stars and also want to comment that these reheat really well, SO, since we''re getting so sick and tired of squash been eating it for 3 weeks now, I''m going to make a huge batch of these and freeze them to eat during the winter, I''m sure we''ll love squash again in January!!REVYellow squash are my favorite squash.  I would simplify it by using selfrising flour.  I would also fry the puffs in Ghee, for extra flavor.  By the way, thanks for the new word offal to be added to my vocabulary, pronounces the same as awful.REVThese are really tasty! I think we''ll try adding hot sauce next time we make them.REVReally enjoyed this.  I added a little less onion and then put in onion powder instead, just simply because I wanted my children to eat them.  I also put the smashed squash into a stainer and shook out excess water.REVThese puffed up nice. I modified the recipe slightly for my picky eater. DD loved the hush puppies served on our summer vacation down south. I omitted the onion and added about     1 c.whole kernel sweet corn in its place. I doubled the recipe and used a whole medium fresh squash, shredded, with skin on in the food processor using the grating attachment no prior cooking required!. ltbrgtMy DS wanted ketchup on his, we also had some with honey.This is a really fun way to use up a little yellow squash and get some veggies in otherwise because they wouldn039t eat squash knowing it was in  there. ltbrgtThanks for sharing.REVTasty little puffs! I would add a little more seasoning next time, maybe cayenne or thyme and maybe make them a little smaller. Great way to use up all those yellow squash that are around this time of year. Thanks for posting.REVThanks for posting this very yummy recipe.  I added 2 teaspoons of sugar because I like sweet cornbread and I grated a clove of garlic to even out the onion...It was just great!  Thanks again!REVTasty little things, but mine were more flat like a pancake or latke. Not sure why they lost their shape. I used an electric skillet and thought it worked pretty slick.REVfirst off, i replaced cornmeal w cornflour, so maybe this is why i had creamy centers...but, it just didnt work for me. Hardly any flavor. REVThis sounds really GOOD!!!  Thank you, I need all the recipes for yellow squash I can get... can''t wait to make it!REVThese taste very good, and are a nice way to use up the yellow squash abundance from summer gardens.  They don''t taste like squash, which would be appealing for those who don''t care for yellow squash.  I agree that they could work nicely as a substitute for hush puppies.REVyummy!  A good way to hide veggies from kids since they look and taste like hushpuppies!  We loved themREVVery yummy......... my kids loved it!  But for me??  To high in calories!!! REVeveryone will love these as an alternative to the someimes dry hushpuppies.  If you''d like to have a little more zing to your squash puffs  substitute fish fry instead of the cornmeal...this gives it a little more seasoning with some spice to it.REVMy 6 year old loved them. I made a few changes because I didn''t have cornmeal in the house. I used whole wheat bread crumbs and for the onion I used 2 Tablespoons of parmasan cheese. Thanks for a great kid friendly recipe.REVMy boys looked at these and said is there squash in here?....ooohhh they are getting better about finding those hidden vegetables.  BUT they loved them and I had no leftovers....Thanks for a great recipe!REVI tried this recipe over the weekend. I thought I had some cornmeal but when I opened the bag, I wasn''t sure if it was still good. So since I already had the recipe started I just added some extra flour.  Needless to say, the puffs were pretty doughy on the inside. Maybe it would be better with the cornmeal. I may try again another time.REVI would probably call these fritters more than puffs, but they were delicious no matter what you call them! I loved them on their own, but I also tried this mixture as a batter for deepfried zucchini and it is great for that, too. The main key there is not to put too much batter on the zucchini because the corn flavor can kind of overpower the zucchini. REVThese were very good.  Good for using up squash.  Thanks for posting.REVWe have made these a bunch of times and love them! Great way to get kids to eat veggies!! I''ve added cheese before and it was great!! Thanks for the recipe! One of our family favorites.REVThese were very good as the recipe stands.  We made two batches.  In the second batch we cut the cornmeal with breadcrumbs which lightened it up some and added southwestern ingredients like finely chopped jalapeno and green onion, garlic powder, cayene pepper, paprika and cumin.  We just put enough dough for one or two in separate bowl and everyone added what they thought would be good.  We also had various dipping sauces available.  The southwestern flavors dipped in ranch won the day. Thanks riffraff for a good recipe using up some of the garden squash as well as a couple of hours entertainment for the family.REVthese were great. i used Jiffy cornbread mix,prepared as on the box, lots of onion powder, some cayenne, and a lil hot salsa that was left in the fridge. the squash gave this a nice texture, and a way to get my bf to eat the squash. i ate them with a lil maple syrup, n he dipped his in a bit of ketchup. this one''s a keeper!REVAwesome recipe!  I did alter it a bit and used about 3 onions and then served them with sour cream and hot sauce.  That combination really brings out the flavor.REVThese were wonderful!  Super easy to make!!  My 5  7 year old even ate them.  We added a little Iowa sweet corn.  Yum!!!!REVJust made these and they remind me of potato latkes or pancakes.  They were quite tasty, but I really try to avoid frying, and that is the only criticism I have.  I wonder if spraying a broiler pan with Pam and putting them in the oven would work?  Maybe I''ll try that the next time I want to make these when I have an extra supply of squash.  A friend dropped off a box maybe 100 small squashand I chose a bunch of Zaar yellow squash recipes that appealed to me.  The only problem is that I still have half a box left!  I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.  I just chopped the onion roughly, and the machine did the rest.  It makes one life a lot easier.  Thank you riffraff for the tasty and savory recipe.REVLooking for ways to use up all my summer squash, i tried these..oh my, sooo good !!!i couldnt stop eating them. I served them with a curry dipping sauce. They would make fantastic appetizers with a little green salad. I will be making these all summer long. thanks for a great recipe.');

It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle. Sometimes my Mom just made Spaetzle, browned some onions in butter and put them over the spaetzle, serve with a fresh green salad and you got a complete meal.REVThis recipe is so close to the one that I received with my Spaetzle maker that I got from a German Store. The only thing different is that mine uses 12 cup water and 12 cup milk. My spaetzle maker is not a potato ricer. It has large holes. like little dumplings. DH and I like them fried in butter.

We had pork satay, and I used the sauce from that for both dishes.REVI love GadoGado and this is a very good recipe.   I sometimes put the salad on a bed of Watrecress when available  Thanks CarolREVMy husband and I lived in Malaysia for 4 years and became WELL acquainted with the local food.  We loved GadoGado which is Indonesian but the Malay love it also and it is seen on many restaurant menus throughout the country.  Southeast Asians normally peel their cucumbers but since we hae returned to living in the states I DON''T, not only because of the nutrient value, but also it adds color to the salad.  I also add shredded carrots to the salad for the same reason but keep the rest of the veggies most like how it was served in Malaysia and Indonesia. 3  The secret to having the BEST GadoGado is the fresh peanut sauce that is used as the dressing.  If making it fresh isn''t your thing, try using Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce found in your local Safeway store in the Ethic region.  It''s the most like the IndonesianMalay sauce served with this salad.  MOST recipes in Malaysia include Tofu cut into small cubes, dusted in cornstarch and fried up in a wok and then added on top of the salad just before serving.  It''s wonderful!!

I made a long distance move, and my cookbooks, along with the book I had this recipe written in, wound up in storage! I haven''t located my cookbooks yet, and couldn''t remember the complete recipe. Now I can finally make my dessert again!!! My family and friends absolutely love this dessert any time of the year!!! I agree with another reviewer, that this stuff is so light and so tastey, you could easily over eat!!!REVSomeone already posted this wasnt Mississippi Mud. They are 100 correct. While there are variations, a true traditional Mississippi Mud always has marshmallow creme. This is a quick delicious layered Jello pudding pie. Ive made it since the 90s. Its also delicious using Pistschio pudding. You can also use lemon pudding using a lemon pie recipe. All flavors are great for summer events. My daughter actually made this and told me she made Mississippi Mud. I told her sorry but its not. I cant believe people misname or rename things wrongly but maybe they accidentally didnt really know. I told my daughter I would be embarrassed for her if she served this Jello recipe which is delicious too and called it Mississippi Mud out in public. Yes, Im old and 50. I just want the younger generation to know the difference. Dont take this wrong. Thanks so much. AmberREVOld family recipe. The one family member that used to make it wouldn039t ever give it out after family breakup! Thank you so much after a few years without it we have our traditional dessert again!!! The only thing we do different is seperate the pudding layers! Relish!!! Thank youREVMy family makes thi sat Thanksgiving except not with the vanilla pudding.  The only problem is it tastes so light its easy to overeat.REVWhen I was a child, one of my girl friend039s Mother used to make this.  That is when I fell in love with Mississippi Mud Pie.  Years later, I finally decided to attempt to make this.  Again, I really love Mississippi Mud Pie, but this particular recipe was OK 4 me.  Maybe I didn039t thoroughly mix 2gether the flour and nut for base crust. I found there were pieces that tasted more flour than nut.  I think this is a lot of work....I guess if the craving strikes again, I may make this again.');

Because I have a potato slicer, making the cubes was a snap.  Eating them was effortless too.  The temptime was perfect for a convection oven.  Thanks, Malarkey.REVWe have made this recipe three times now and we love it! The potatoes turn out perfect, and its really easy to make! I always just cut up some red potatoes into chunks and then throw them in the oven. I have doubled this recipe twice and it turns out perfect. I do need to add salt on them though once they come out of the oven. This one''s a keeper!REVI was looking to make fresh hash browns this weekend and came upon this recipe. I made it exactly as stated and it turned out just as I''d hoped. I couldn''t taste much spicyness, just a hint, which was good. I ended up with some leftovers which were quickly reheated in a skillet the next day and tasted just as good. Thanks a lot, I''ll definitely be making these again!REVDelicious!

These are great hashbrowns!  Don''t listen to what an earlier poster, Jeff, said about these not being hashbrown because they''re baked.  

This comes out just like hashbrowns on the stove only better, less greasy and nicely spiced!  Thanks for posting!REVFantastic!  Just what I was looking for this morning.  I halved the recipe and I diced the potatoes fairly small and baked them for 45 minutes.  Next time I''ll make them a little bigger.  The flavor was just enough to tingle but not overpowering, and I added a couple shakes of garlic powder.  I will definitely make these again and try to freeze them and see how they work.  Wonderful, thanks!!!REVThese were great! I have never baked hashbrowns before, its nice to be able to toss them in the over without parboiling or monitoring them in a skillet. I pumped up the spices a little and added two onions diced in large chunks.REVDelicious hash browns!  I shredded my potatoes but cooked them for the same amount of time.  They came out perfectly, a lovely golden brown.  What a wonderful treat, thanks for posting!REVI shredded my potatoes as others indicated, but was very disappointed in the results.  The potatoes had very little flavor and stuck to the baking pan.REVI like the idea of cooking these hash browns in the oven, but next time I will add a little more salt maybe even a dash of garlic salt.REVThese were great!  Easy to prepare and no worrying about them!  I think they need a little extra seasoning, but they are a definite make again recipe in our house! Thanks.REVVery tasty! I sprinkled the hash browns with seasoning salt when they came out of the oven, and they were perfect.REVEasy! Delicious!  We cooked them on the bbq!REVPretty good, certainly had a kick to them! Yummy though.REVWe make these almost every weekend especially with comany. Our guest love a little heatspice. This is a perfect recipe. Thank you Kumquat.

May Made a tweak to the recipe after all these months, and it adds a nice robust extra to this awesome recipe. I have added half a T of Onion Powder and half a T of Adobo. Substitute for garlic powder.REVI used the basic ingredients from this recipe didn''t follow all the directions. The only directions I did follow were the baking directions and how to mix all the ingredients together. The ingredients were simple and the hash browns were easy to make. I just reccomend, for those who like their hash browns a little crunchy, pan frying the hash browns in a greased skillet after they have cooked in the oven. Great recipe!!!REVThis was a great recipe! I just can''t make frozen hash brownsthey always come out bad!! But my husband loves them, and I was glad to find this recipe to try on him. He enjoyed them, but thought the spice mixture needed just a bit more salt  spice. I used 2 cups diced potatoes, and had already upped the spices but next time will use a bit more! They looked wonderfulcrisp on the outside from the oil  had great color. Thanks so much for sharing! I am grateful to add this to his breakfast menu!REVFor some reason the 5th time I made these they turned out the best.  Up go the stars.REVIt was a hit in our household. Definitely had a kick. Made it pretty much as per recipe but had to substitute red pepper for cayenne pepper it may actually be the same thing. Will definitely make again.REVI didn''t like the taste of the hash browns baked but the seasoning was wonderful, really spicy and flavorful.  I''m going to try this recipe again but will fry the potatoes instead.REVReally tasty!  I didn''t use the red pepper flakes, instead subbed in about 14 tsp of hot paprika.  this made them mild enough my toddler could eat them.REVGood! Shredded the potatoes, but would probably cube them next time. Flavor was very good, prep very easy. Thanks for sharing the recipe! UPDATE Cut the potatoes in small cubes, as stated in the recipe, which worked beautifully. Will definitely make these again. Thanks!REVI made these for breadfast on Sunday morning and they crisped up so nice.  I liked the combination of spices on this and the crispy edges were to die for.  I will make this again and again.  I made fairly large cubes for ours but I''m sure you could do it anyway with this recipe.  Thank you for posting.REVVery Tasty! I love how little olive oil you use. I shredded my potatoes in my Kitchenaid and they turned out great. Very easy.REVI make them regularly because the are easy, no mess, and less oily than fried.REVI made these this weekend to go with grilled amberjack.  They were great.  I will be making these potatoes on a regular basis.REVHash browns are pan fried, not baked.REVThis time I cooked the hash browns in a toaster oven and they were perfect.   I diced the potatoes a little larger than I would for the conventional oven as the heat seems more direct.  Once again they were crisp outside and soft centered. Easy excellent recipeREVGreat recipe!  I made these to go with Troy''s Easy Garlic Chicken Breasts.  The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside and had a great taste to them!  Delicious!REVThis is a well written, easy to follow recipe which uses ingredients I generally have on hand.  I followed the directions exactly, except I did cook mine about 4045 minutes because I like them crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  And they were that along with a very nice blend of spice.  Thank you Gay for sharing your recipe.REVVery nice. They didn''t turn out at all greasy and they stay perfectly moist on the inside, while crisping on the outside.REVVery good! I doubled the red pepper in mine just to have it a little spicy, and it was not too hot. Easy to prepare and has a good crispiness without cooking in oil. Makes an excellent addition to breakfast! Thanks for posting.REVVery good!  We chopped our potatoes pretty finely in the food processor, and they turned out great.  Nice and crisp and flavorful.  I reduced the red peppers I used cayenne to just a dash because I was worried that it would be too spicy, but the spices mellow a lot during cooking.  Mine were lovely and crisp, chewy and tender just like hashbrowns should be!  This is a really nice breakfast recipe, because you can just throw it in the oven while you''re making pancakes and eggs on the range and not have to worry about it or deal with another pan on the stove.    Very good flavor and  very nice that you can just put them in the oven and forget them and worry about the rest of the meal!  I love hashbrowns and this is surely a keeper.  REVI made this for Christmas brunch. The family LOVED it. I used frozen shredded potatoes and cut the hot spices by a third for the more sensitive tummies. I also added coarsely chopped yellow onion.  I didnt have chili powder on hand so had to cheat with some Creole seasoning. The shredded potatoes cooked down quite a lot and I wished I had made more. Everyone wanted thirds. Thanks for this awesome recipe Gay Gilmore.  REVHi Gay, I was desperate for something to make along with leftover pork loin.  I had a bad of frozen hashbrowns in the freezer and I used you recipe on them.  They turned out wonderful and the family loved the spiciness!  tree luee deeREVAwesome! I woke up with a hankering for hash browns today and these were just spicy and crispy enough for us. They hit the spot! Thanks, Gay!REVGreat hash browns!  I made these for two servings by cutting the ingredients in half.  We loved the spicey tang of the chili powder. No more greasy hash browns for us.  This recipe is very easy and less time consuming that regular hash browns. REVThis was ok....needed a little more time to cook, and a little more spice for me.  Some salt and a little more pepper too.  All in all, was good.REVAn easy dish to make, turned out great. Loved the flavor.  I added 12 tsp each garlic powder and onion powder. I too cooked mine a little longer, we like the hash browns crispy. As good as a resturant. Thank you for sharing.REVMy husband thought these were better than he had at a restarant for a long time and much better than some of the fried recipes.REVThese hash browns were wonderful. I cut them small so they would cook through and turn out a little crunchy.  In 30 min they were crunchy and the spice was wonderful since they were so small.REVThank you so much for sharing this recipe!  My DH loves hashbrowns and orders them any time we go out to breakfast.  But I have never been able to make them well.  This is the closest I''ve ever been to what he likes.  Thank you very much.REVThese were good and had a nice flavor to them. I followed the recipe exactly as written but I too used frozen already chopped potatoes.REVThese were great. I followed your recipe exactly and we thought the spicing was perfection. Thanks for sharing this one!REVCubed the potatoeseveryone loved them!!! REVI used a 1 lb. frozen organic hash brown mix from my freezer and halved the rest of the ingredients.  I chose this recipe because I had everything available on my kitchen shelf and was low fat to boot.  I allowed my hashed browns to defrost quite a bit before cooking, used a small casserole dish, substituted cayenne pepper powder for red pepper, and cooked for recommended length of time.  This made the top nice and brown, and under layers soft.  Served with extra hot sauce, yum!  Easy, quick, and healthful!REVExcellent Hash Browns! These turned out great and tasted even better! Thanks Malarkey Test....REVThese hash browns are to die for!!!  I am on a very low carb diet and just one bite and I kept eating them against my will!  Spicy enough that my husband liked them and not so spicy that my little boy scarfed them down as well.  VERY GOOD RECIPE!!!!REVThese were excellent although they weren''t as spicy as I thought they would be.  For us, they could be spiced up quite a bit and this recipe is so easy that we were able to do so with no problem.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!REVI cheated and used frozen cubed potatoes and the same spices and they were really tasty. Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will make them again.');

It''s a near twin to a recipe my mother used to make. And I find that I like it better without the raisins. But all in all a keeper recipe.REVi have now made this recipe twice out of 3 days. i find it very moist and sweet. i put more apple in just because, after 35 minutes it was done perfect with a little crunch on top.  really enjoyed sharing it with freinds who loved it too.thank you for sharing.REVI made this, this afternoon and we loved it.  It was so easy to make.  I didn''t use the raisins.  While it was baking the whole house smelled like apples.  This will be added to my favorites.  Thank you for a great recipe.REVI found the pie to be very good.  I did accidently, on purpose, omit the 34 cup surgar.  Just sounded like too much sugar.  It would have taken the guess work out of it if the baking time had been included in the recipe.  I also, baked for about 45 miunutes.  I would bake again.   And again, would leave out the 34 cup of sugar.REVeveryone LOVED this.  it''s very sweet even though i, too, omitted the extra 34 cup sugar.  i did not have fresh nutmeg, but used organic, and the spice mixture was wonderful.  it''s great as a dessert with whipped cream, or as a nice breakfast with tea.  the directions do not mention where to add the butter, i just mixed it in with the other wet ingredients before blending with the dry.  thank you so much for posting this!  i will be making for Thanksgiving this year!REVloved it!!! I did not add the 34 cup of sugar, as did some others, just sounded to sweet for our taste.  But over all awesome dish!REVthis was wonderful warm with cream for sweets tonight. i left out the peacans as my family doesnt appreciate nuts but they really loved this piecake  many thanks for a delious recipeREVThe flavor of this was good, but the making of it didn''t go very well.  There were a lot of steps, which isn''t necessarily a  bad thing, but it didn''t fall together like most cake recipes.  For example, I couldn''t figure out why I had to melt the butter and of course cool it when I was just creaming it, or why add the sugar in two parts.   I had tons of tunnels.  And it would be helpful if there was a number for how long to bake.  At least a range, especially for us novice cooks.   It took 45 minutes for me.REVthis  was a real hit, i also omitted the 34 cup of sugar and the raisins. i also used chopped almonds instead of pecans, cause that is was i had on hand. i will make it again.');

This is a very easy recipe if you have an easy espresso maker.REVI think I would add less sugar it was too sweet for me.  Next time I will lighten it probably to include less sugar and skim milk.
