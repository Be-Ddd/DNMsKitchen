Added some oranges because we didn''t have enough lemons. I think I''ll be making this for my daughters birthday party!!!REVMy parents went like wow when they dranked it! REVReally nice lemonade. Used a potato peeler to get the zest off.  No white comes off if you do it in a light pressure zig zag.  After it chilled the children loved the zest sprinkled with more sugar.REVIt was hot the other day and I decided to make some lemonade.  This really quenched our thirst and was awesome!REVThe taste was excellent, and it really wasn''t difficult to make at all.  My stepdaughter and I did this one afternoon, and everything turned out great the only change we made was to add more hot water to dissolve the sugar the amount called for was not quite enough.  Very good taste, especially with the lemon zest.  Excellent recipe we''ll use often.REVcomplicated recipe but cool.REVMy favourite lemonade recipe is essentially the same as this. Allowing the sugar to absorb the lemon oils is what makes it so delicious. The syrup is quite concentrated so a little goes a long way. I usually use the zest of 4 lemons, their juice and 1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup sugar. It''s good old fashioned lemonade. Use mineral water to dilute the syrup and you get a great fizzy drink.REVI made this with limes instead of lemosn and it was the best limeade i''ve ever had! sooo good!');

Then removed and sauteacuteed the chicken breasts which I did not cover during cooking. Made my sauce in the same pan and poured over my chicken. I just had the butcher cut chicken breasts in half. Did not pound them. I baked for approximately 30 minutes covered and they came out great! The sauce is excellent!REVThis was AMAZING with a few minor changes. I only used 6 breast halves, but the same amount of the sauce. I sauteed onions and garlic in the same pan after I removed the mushrooms.  To the sauce mixture I added dried oregano and thyme and added back the onions and garlic to let it all reduce together.    I served with mashed potatoes.REVThis was delicious !  I used 4 chicken breasts which when cut and pounded made 8 nice pieces and left all the other ingredient amounts the same.  I subbed fontina for the mozzarella.

AWSOME!  We cut it down for 2 and it was one of the best meals we have had in awhile.REVWe just loved this one!  I cut boneless chicken breasts into pieces, then followed the rest of the recipe.  It came out juicy and we loved the taste!REVThis was YUMMY!  My only changes were 4 chicken breastslrg cut into 4 pieces each and I put the salt on the chicken before I dredged it in the flour.  I didn''t have anything but white cooking wine and burgundy.  Did less than called for but upped the chicken broth.  Also didn''t have fresh parmesan cheese  but since I doubled the sauce, the chicken was almost floating.  Sprinkled the pregrated parmesan and then covered with mozzarella.  Everyone of my family loved this.  Great quick chicken meal.  I will be stocking the staples for the future!REVWhen I first read through the ingredients, I thought that the quantity of marsala would overwhelm the dish, but, boy, was I wrong!  In spite of its great rich flavor, this recipe is much lighter than I expected. Easy to put together.  I did as one reviewer suggested and made the entire sauce recipe and only two chicken breasts DH likes lots of sauce, and it was the perfect amount for our taste.  Served over fettucine with roasted asparagus on the side. This recipe''s a keeper!!REVthis was SOOO good!! the flavor was awesome! all the flavors blended so well. it would be 6 stars if that was possible.REVDH  I really enjoyed this recipe!

Will be making thisdish again soon.REVLove this dish!  Have made this for friends as well and everyone is always impressed.  Great flavor!REVThis is an excellent dish. I opted to serve it with roasted potatoes instead of noodles. The combination was very delicious and made a nice presentation on the plate!REVThis dish is out of this world. I used marinaited capatella cheese, provalone, and parmesan. The combination of cheeses was wonderful. I made rosemary buttered noodles asa my side dish along with a nice crusty loaf of bread. YUMMY!!!! Cudos on this recipe Mrs. QREVMy family loves this recipe !REVMy Guests raved about this dish! I followed the directions exactly and it was wonderful. Served it with steamed asparagus and a green salad no noodles or carbs of any kind.  My wife said to be sure to keep this recipe as it is now one of her favorite chicken dishes. REVThis was easy enough to make though, it took me longer because I could only cook two chicken filets at a time.  Very tasty.  If you use noodles, I would suggest to double and perhaps triple the amount of sauce simmered chicken broth and marsala at the end because it goes great over the noodles I also recommend egg noodles for this dish.  Will definitely make again.REVWhen I made it I didn''t have any wine, so I used a few drops of spiced vinegar and sugar.  Also, as a variation I made it with pork chops, except I substituted the broth with apple juice, water, spiced vinegar, a touch of mustard and cinnamon.  Also, very good.  Both ways, definitely a keeper.REVThis is an easytomake and enjoyable dish. I made a few subsitutions in the recipeinstead of Marsala and chicken broth which I didn''t haveI used canned tomatoes and I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. It was great served with pasta.REVI give this recipe a good to high rating because it just tastes good and is realitivly easy to make.  I used Cream Sherry as I didn''t have any Marsala, and it turned out really good. Broiling the cheese is a really good idea, its adds just a little crunch that makes this dish supurb!REVthis is a real keeper.

This will be my new standard recipe for beef stew!REVmade this in my slow cooker....delicious!REVits aiightREVThis was an easy, tasty, and healthy stew. I used regular stew meat and yellow onions with carrots, celery, new potatoes, and parsnip as well as a few extra seasonings, including a pinch of powdered cayenne pepper and a 12 t. of sugar. The thickened gravy was especially good.REVThis is a great beef stew didn''t use the pearl onions, just sliced yellow...and used some leftover green beans for the sugar snaps.
Make for the Lowfat event in CPF.REVThis was an OK stew, but I had to add many more vegetables and double the base to really make it a meal, which is what I expect when making a stew. Left out the pearl onions and used a white onion, sliced thickly. The flavor of the base may make it worth trying again.REVmmm mmm good! We enjoyed this stew very much.  I used ordinary stewing beef and used sherry for the wine, delicious!  I used less bably carrots and added celery, rutabega, fennel bulb and rather than pearl onions, which are to hard to get, used regular white onon and left out the snap peas in favour of the fennel bulb. I cut all the veggies into large chunks.  Also cut the cornstarch to just one tablespoon  which thickened it quite nicely.  Lovely favlourful stew, I will be makeing again.');

Fantastic recipe...thanks.REVA different kind of bruschetta, but I couldn''t ask for a more tasty treat. I served these up as the first course of an italian feast for my parents anniversary.

Tasty dressing. The parsley was a nice touch. Cilantro would have worked as well. It was very good served as a side to spicy chicken fajitas with some rice and guacamole and summer squash.REVWasn''t thrilled with this salad much at all. Didn''t like the texture of the black beans with corn and we found the whole thing pretty much tasteless.  Sorry but won''t be repeating this one.REVThis a great with hamburgers after over a week of holiday food.  Simple, light and easy!  Taking some suggestions from other reviewers, I did add a dash of cilantro and also some chick peas I had left over from another recipe.  I loved the flavors!  Will make this again!REVYummy! I was looking for something easy to whip up for a dinner party. The main dish was chicken enchiladas and this recipe made a great side dish. I threw this all together and heated it on the stove for about 10 minutes. I used a can of seasoned black beans, and I threw in some ground cumin and garlic salt. I didn''t use lettuce leaves since I served it hot. Come summer I''ll try this as a salad!REVI loved this! Made recipe just as written. Beautiful simple flavors. Served this with some leftover chicken skewers and lettuce.REVDelicious!  I will definitely make this again.  I brought it to a church function, and had requests for the link to your recipe.  I used frozen corn.  Thanks!REVGreat salad ... only addition I made was equal amounts of cilantro and parsley.  Will make again.REVThis recipe is one that I make again.  I loved all of the flavors and textures.  Unfortunately, the rest of my family didn''t as much...but that''s ok...more for me!REVThanks, Dave, for a tasty and simple to make salad.

Yummy!REVEasy and simple.  We loved it. Thanks.REVThis salad is a complete, satisfying, refreshing and nutritious meal and quite pretty too, I must say!. The next time around I will probably use less lemon juice a bit too much ''zing'' for my personal taste, but I will definately make it again.REVThis tasted great!  I also used a lot of cilantro.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!REVEasy and delicious! I used frozen corn and served this with cuban spiced pork chops 134871. Very good. Needed a little salt and pepper, but a very nice summer salad. REVThis was a delicious salad! We subbed coriander cilantro for the parsley and used frozen corn and cooked, dried beans.REVWe liked this recipe a lot because it''s very flavorful.  As I''ve had a chance to adjust the recipe to our taste, it''s evolved into something that we enjoy often.  We substitute lime juice for the lemon juice and significantly increase the amount.  I use frozen corn and instead of the fresh parsely leaves I use a lot of cilantro.  As mentioned by another reviewer, I throw in a good pinch of sea salt.  Usually, I substitute a finely minced red onion for the scallion.  I also find that the flavors in this salad improve greatly as it sits, so I try to make it the evening before we want to eat it.  This is a staple at our house!  It''s very versatile and my kids love it with some chips or to roll into a tortilla.  Thank you for posting it!REVThis was quite good and even better the second day after the flavors had more time to blend.  I used frozen corn to save time and it worked very well I undercooked it just a bit to keep it''s crunch.  Next time I would use less olive oil.REVthe combination of ingredients is smart, but this recipe as is desparately needs some sea salt and balsamic vinegar for that extra kick.REVThis recipe was awesome!

All my kids raved about it, so we will use this often this summer.  Next time I plan to try it on some ribs!REVThis was super quick and easy to make.  It has a wonderful, rich flavour and is equally nice for a brush on sauce on the grill or a slow cook method.  I added a small drop of liquid smoke flavour and extra garlic.  I''ve made this many times since I first found the recipe and everyone LOVES it.  Use it on any meat, it''s great!REVWhat flavor!  Used on chicken and my son grabbed what was left of the sauce to take home.  Can''t wait to try this on ribs now.  Made for the Comfort Cafe, a tag game.REVOutstanding!  The only change I made was add 2 Tblsp water rather than add 1 Tblsp water to dry mustard.  Didn''t have expresso so made a strong pot of coffee and added that.  Fabulous flavor  deep and rich.

The whole family was raving over the barbecue sauce and wanted to know the brand and store where we bought it! Even grandma, who was sure that it would be too spicy for her, asked for more to dip her barbecued ribs into. Thanks for sharing the recipe!REVThis is a great sauce!  The only change I made was to substitute apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  Next time I think I''m going to mix in chipotle powder with the chili powder for a smokey kick.REVThis sauce is amazing. I have been looking for a recipe for a sauce similar to the sauce served at my favorite hometown rib joint. This is the closest thing I have found. I followed the recipe and only added 14 cup of bourbon.REVThis was an excellent sauce! I did cut it in half and still have some left for next time. It was really tangy and BH really liked it. He was the one who braved the cold and went outside to cook it on the grill after I had marinaded two ribs for about an hour. I gave him some extra sauce to baste with and all turned out well. The time it took to prepare and the long list of ingredients used was well worth it. I may even try this during the winter as a slow roast or even a crockpot recipe for ribs as I still have quite a few of them in the freezer.REVVery nice flavored bbq sauce!

I added dethawed frozen pea pods  broccoli florets once the celery  onions were tender. I''ll repeat this recipe with different veggie combinations in the future. Thanx Robb!REVGreat  v useful for the brown ricestock ratio for over baking. Thanks');

It was easy to make  my 6yr old and I used the full amount of almond extract and crumbled the toasted almonds by hand.  It''s a great recipe for turning the yuck bananas into something yummy.REVCame out great for a chocolate Easter cake. I made an almond cream cheese frosting instead of a chocolate glaze to make it more Springlike. Very moist and the banana is definately the strongest flavor coming from the cake. Will definately make again.REVStep 11 states to drizzle glaze over top and down side of cake, but WHAT glaze? I''d already used all the ingredients in the cake, and hadn''t set aside anything to use to make a glaze. While it smelled fabulous while baking, and had a moist, dense texture, the flavor didn''t measure up. I did substitue unsalted butter for the margarine, and generic almonds instead of Dole brand but I would think the butter would have made it better, not worse. I did make my own glaze, which was fine, but it really didn''t help the cake.REVYum! This cake was gone in no time. It was really light and moist.I used butter. I cut the sugar down to 1c and  I also didn''t make a glaze for it and it was delicious and sweet enough for us. My boyfriend went out and bought more bananas for me to make it again!');

Everyone raved over it.  We did add the leftover pork filling from the egg rolls to it, as we did not want to waste anything.  It actually gave some additional texture and color, with the grated carrots.  We did not use 4 eggs, but cut that amount in half.  Also, we substituted the red chile paste with cayenne pepper.  All of it tasted better than any restaurant we have been to in the USA and abroad.  Thanks again for the great and  fairly quick recipe.REVI can''t believe how great this recipe is!  It tastes just like the hot and sour soup I have been craving, but can''t have in the UK bc we can''t afford to eat out.  

I left out the pork, eggs, carrot, water chestnut, and black fungus.  It was delicious.  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and did not find the soup thick at all.

Next time I''ll try to find golden needles and black fungus, and then maybe open a Chinese restaurant!  

Thanks for a great recipe that I''ll be sharing with family and friends!REVI made this recipe exactly how it is written except omitting the tofu, and it turned out pretty good. I really like the restaurant version of hot  sour soup, and this had a little different taste, but VERY close! I think the ingredients that threw the flavor off was the mushrooms. I used canned shiitake  straw mushroom only way I could find them and was not impress with the flavor  texture it gave. Next attempt will be with fresh button mushrooms...which I''ve had at a couple Chinese restaurants. Thanks so much!!REVThis was an awesome recipe.  I was looking for something that replicated a soup that my fiance and I had in Hong Kong and with a few additions this recipe was perfect.  Used more broth and less cornstarch.  Added cilantro, bean sprouts, half the chili paste, and used regular mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms.  Next time I think I will make it thicker and possibly add noodles in place of tofu.  My fiance is already begging me to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe Nancy!REVWe really enjoyed this soup. My 15yo daughter has been jonesing for Hot  Sour soup so off I went to find a recipe. My 14 LOVED it, the grownups did too! I used 2 eggs, all dried mushrooms which I hydrated, added both chicken and tofu. I was not thick from the corn starch or too salty or too tangy from the vinegar. It was a golden brown color and very appealing.  Super good on day 2 for lunch! It''s a winner all the way around. Thanks for sharing Nancy!REVAWESOME !!!!! I will never buy  hot  sour soup  from  a  restaraunt  again !
i added some wasabi bean sauce  and japanese  pepper pods  to  heat  it  up  a bit more but   apart  from  that it  was SPOT ONREVThis is a GREAT recipe. Super easy to make, and tastes better than the soup in most of the chinese restaurants Ive been to!REVVery good !! I didn''t have chili  paste so used 2 large cloves of garlic and a heaping 12 tsp. of Italian pepper seeds. That was just the right amount of heat for us. 1 rounded Tbsp. of cornstarch was perfect. Did use about 12 tsp. of pepper but will omit it next time. The bite was harsh. I will also omit the egg. I don''t believe it adds to the flavor and the broth would be much more appealing to the eye without it. Did garnish with chopped Cilantro. It added a nice flavor and additional color.REVTakes a bit of time to make, but it is one of the greats for hot and sour.REVThis was outstanding.  I reduced a few ingredients 1 tb chile sauce, 12 pkg of tofu, 3 tb cornstarch and 3 eggs.  And I didn''t use the fungus.  It was fabulous and surprisingly easy  I have saved this in my favorites!REVAbsolutely delicious!  Relying on some of the other reviews, I used only 1 tsp. of cornstarch and 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste, and when tastetesting it was not spicy enough my family likes strong taste so I ended up using 2 tbsp paste as the recipe said.  I also increased the soy to 3 tbsp and used 13 cup rice vinegar in place of 14 cup white vinegar.  I also used lowsodium soy sauce, which worked fine.  This was wonderful, flavorful and very authentictasting.  Thanks for a great recipe!REVOk so this is an ok recipe I added some stuff and mine tastes like it came from a restaurant black fungus lily flower buds and a few other things and it perfectREVI can''t believe I have never left a rating on this absolutely fabulous recipe.  I''ve made it for years and everyone just raves over it. The recipe has been passed out numerous times. It is the BEST hot and sour soup I have ever had and that includes in Chinese restaurants.  It is my go to recipe, period. 
We like it hot so I used 3 tablespoons of the garlicchili sauce. I omitted the carrots and used 2 beaten eggs instead of the more healthy egg substitute. Regarding the cornstarch, I just keep adding the slurry until it looks to be the right consistency.  Everything else is as the recipe recommends....including the black fungus...or wood ear mushrooms. 
Thanks so much, Nancy.REVI just finished making this for dinner tonight and just had to taste it.  What a flavor sensation. I didn''t see where it said to add the carrots so I put them in with the bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts.   I used 1 T  garlic red chili sauce, 14 c. egg substitute and only had button mushrooms and dried shitake and  also no tofu.   This is one dynamite hot and sour soup.  I can''t wait until I have all the correct ingredients.  This is great as I made it though.REVIt was just what we were looking for!  I didn''t have some of the mushrooms and skipped the tofu but it was great!  We''ll definitely be making this recipe again.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, we cut back the Chili to 1.5 tbsp and it was just the right heat.REVOh. My. This is the holy grail of Hot and Sour Soup. Fried up a batch of wonton strips and everybody had seconds. This is a definite keeper.REVWhen I visited China I ate a lot of hot and sour soup, mostly because I could be more sure of the ingredients!  This is the closest I''ve found to the taste of the soup there, better than any restaurant soup I''ve tried.  I make it with extra garlic chile mix and no meat.  Only problem is, I haven''t found dried black fungus.  Maybe it would be even better?REVWe love to order hot and sour soup in the restaurant, so I was a bit leary of trying this at home.  I knew my family would be tough to please when it came to this soup.  I read through the instructions and thought I will try it.  I am so glad I did....this is so good.  I used my homemade chicken stock, and instead of straw mushrooms I used button mushrooms what I had on hand, otherwise followed your recipe exactly.  We really loved this and I plan on making this quite often when we make a chinese style meal.  Thank you so much for posting this.REVI''m so happy to have found this soup!  I happily used 2 T of garlic chili sauce  I like my lips to be a little numb when I finish my Hot and Sour Soup!  I only used 1 egg and didn''t have any dried black fungus.  I also used about 8 oz of tofu and that was plenty for us.  My husband and son were so impressed, they figured the local Chinese restaurant could use me for a chef. Thanks for posting!REVgreat flavor  I made it fully vegan so omitted the pork and egg and used vegetarian base.  I would def. tone down the heat a bit for most audiences.  I love the spice but it was even hot for me.REVI was unable to find the black fungi but the recipe turned out GREAT! I''ve tried dozens of recipes and none can compare to this one. It''s a keeper.REVSpot on!REVI am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I thought with all the positive reviews here it would be restaurantquality. Boy was I wrong!I followed this recipe exactly, omitting the water chestnut and carrots, but I still found it too bitter. I would back off on the vinegar but I can''t think of any other way to improve this recipe. It was just plain awful! I will pay 1 for a cup of awesome authentic hot  sour at my local Chinese restaurant from now on.REVWonderful recipe with the modifications others have suggested less chili paste, cornstarch, egg a slight bit more vinegar  I used rice vinegar. I also reduced the soy sauce to 1 T. Also, to make things even easier, I use canned straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots and baby corn, and reconstituted shiitake mushrooms. I also omitted the pork and water chestnuts. If I have more time, I like to add the black fungus, and tiger lily buds golden needles.REVJust as good as any Chinese restaurant soup!  Excellent flavor and overall taste!REVExcellent !REVBelieve everything. I made this soup a week ago and I''m about to make it again, so I thought I would post. Excellent soup. I''m not much of a cook so I just went through the comments and modified the recipe to my liking based on what others said. I was very impressed with the way it turned out, will make often.REVVery good recipe. I enjoyed the spiciness very much, as my family is used to eating very spicy Indian dishes. However, if you are not into extremely spicy foods, I suggest reducing the chili paste.

SashwatREVGreat recipe for anyone who like it as close as it come to the real thing! Very simple to make and you can find all the ingredents in your local supermarket! I myself would cut back on the white pepper and add a little bit of hot oil not to much! I would also add about 1 12 tbls more of vineger. or to taste add a little more meat and you can serve with a bowl of white rice with steamed veggies for a meal of its own.REVmy family like the bamboo shoots whole. but we love your recipeREVMy boyfriend and i were very pleased with this recipe. he is half chinese so he knows the good stuff. the only thing we changed was the amount of chili paste. we only put one tablespoon instead of 2. the soup is very very spicy with 2 tblsp''s. other than that it was great. the flavor is awesome. my boyfriend said that it tasted just like his mom''s. that is a great compliment.
amityREVLoved it!REVthis was pretty good on the whole. a few things the cornstarch was waaay too much and it made the soup unbearably thick, less soupy and more mealie. i''ll probably use just three tablespoons next time, perhaps less. the two tablespoons of chili sauce were also too much, just one would suffice. otherwise, the recipe is good. i omitted the pork and used less egg. i couldn''t find black fungus so used dried wild mushrooms which worked out just fine. the soup is very filling and will have your scalp sweating by the time you''re done.REVWith a few adjustments this is the best I have ever made.  I''ve searched far and wide for a good recipe, and here it is.  I added two additional cups of broth.  Used 2 tablespoons of corn starch, two eggs, and a splash more vinegar.  I agree that using the two tablespoons of chili sauce makes it really really hot, but I like it that way.  Served it with sticky rice.  It was tremendous.  What a find.  Thanks for posting this recipe.REVThis recipe is the bomb!  This is the closest to the restaurant kind that I''ve ever encountered.  It has a permanent home in my personal recipe box now.  As said in earlier posts, I would definitely only recommend using 1 Tbsp. of the chili sauce instead of 2 Tbsp.  Also, only 4 Tbsp. of the corn starch is needed.  Otherwise, it''ll congeal pretty quickly.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone seeking the real thing.REVI found this to be just great!  I cut the recipe in half, and I took some of the others'' advice and reduced the cornstarch for half the recipe I only used 1 Tbsp.  I also did not use the black fungus, used rice vinegar instead of white, and only used 1 egg.  This tasted like I was eating it at a restaurant...I served it with steamed dumplings and Pad Thai as the main course.REVKick ass!  I love hot and sour soup and I could live on it!  This recipe is oooh la la. 

Here''s what I did different  halfed the amount of garlic and chili paste and that''s saying a lot bc I love me some HOT stuff, and halfed the amount of cornstarch.  I doubled the amount of soy, vinegar and sesame oil.  I also increased the egg and tofu amount a tiny bit bc I excluded the yolks in half the eggs I used and I love tofu.  USE YOUR OWN VARIATION AND ENJOY  IT DOESN''T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!!REVExcellent recipe, however I used only one egg  cut back on the corn starch. I''ve also used canned chinese stirfry vegetables bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, mushrooms  bean sprouts  frozen shrimp in this soup for variation  ease.REVWOW!  This really IS the BEST!!!!  I took others advice, and only used 1 Tbsp. of the chili paste, and it was more than enough.  I don''t like tofu, so I just used twice as much of the mushrooms.  If you''re looking for the best, this is it!REVWe make this recipe OFTEN! It is the best we''ve ever tasted. Modifications
1.Double recipe and freeze it.
2. Leave out eggs until ready to eat.
3. Black pepper instead of white.
4. Use only 5 TBSP cornstarch in doubled recipe.
5. Leave out bamboo shoots.
6. Use whatever kind of mushrooms are available. Usually a mix of several kinds.
7. Rice vinegar instead of white.
8. Leave out black fungus.REVWith a few adjustments, this is about perfect.  Like others, I found 1 tbsp. of garlic and red chile paste provided plenty of punch and 2 tbsp. cornstarch was right.  I used 4 eggs, but next time I''ll use two.  The vegetables can be varied at will.  I used Golden Needles, but no fungus and regular mushrooms instead of the straw.  We did not care for water chestnuts in the soup and I wouldn''t use them next time.  And there WILL be a next time, because I am now done looking for the Hot and Sour Soup of my dreams.REVTastse surpasses any found in Chinese restaurant!  Presents well.  Simple to make.
I cut hot pepper by 50, omitted the pork.  Am striving to reduce the sodium.REVThis is the first time I''ve left a review.  Could not resist because this soup was so good.  I always order Hot  Sour soup at chinese restaurants, it''s my favourite.  And I''ve tried to make it from scratch several times unsuccessfully.  This recipe was easy and the ultimate Hot  Sour soup.  I will never look further for a recipe.  The changes I made were to use 1.5 tbsp of chili paste I like spice but would reduce further if not used to it, 2 eggs and 3 tbsp of cornstarch, no pork, no straw mushrooms and substituted dried porcini mushrooms for the dried black fungus. Next time I''d try to find the dried black fungus and cut the water chestnuts into smaller pieces. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.REVI just made this soup.........I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  It is soooo good!  I made it as stated in the recipe except I only put 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste.  This is even better than any hot sour soup I''ve had at Chinese restaurants!  Thanks for this keeper!REVI made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.I cut the chili paste in half,used less cornstarch , 2 eggs and substituted chicken for pork. It had enough heat, but each person could add more chili sauce if desired. I will make this again.REVI made this as it is listed.  I really enjoyed it and will make it again soon.REVWay too hot!  Cut the chili paste dramatically if you don''t want to burn your lips!  I ruined the whole batch by following the directions exactly.  I wish I had followed the other reviewers'' advice!REVAlso loved this recipe.  Cut back on the eggs used 3 and omitted pork and tofu.  Added a splash more vinegar an used reconstituted shiitake''s.  Yum!  Perfect for killing a cold.REVI apologize for taking so long to review this recipe as I have made this now at least 3 times. I did make some changes but only because we like our soup not quit as thick as what this recipe calls for. Therefore I used 4 tbs of cornstarch and 2 eggs. I did not think that the chili sauce needed to be adjusted. We all agreed that it had just the right amount of heat. My daughter enjoys this so much that she now fixes a big pot of it on the weekends minus all the meat and veggies and eats it for lunch through out the week. This is a prize recipe.');

I got my fix. Thanks for posting Carole Reu!!REVThis turned out really good and was a big hit with our resident chocolate lovers at Christmas dinner.  A couple notes I made it the night before and left it in the fridge overnight. I used 4 egg yolks instead of 3 in the filling and 1 milk. The finished pie had a little bit of syrupy liquid in it. Apparently this is from the meringue and is completely normal, it did not change the taste of the pie at all. I also used a store bought graham cracker pie crust which worked just fine. It set almost immediately and cut into real slices. Great recipe.REVI didn''t put the Meringue on top of the pie because we don''t like it, but make it as a Chocolate Cream Pie...  We LOVED this pie!  Thick and rich chocolate.  Perfect with some Cool Whip on top... Yum!REVMy only problem with this recipe is that I now have to try really hard to not be a little snot when someone else makes a chocolate pie I want to tell them their pie is alright but my new recipe is so much better. WOW!! 10 stars! I like pie, but I love this one, and it is now the pie I have to make for every event because it039s just too good to pass up an opportunity to eat it. So rich and thick. Had no trouble getting it to set up. Very easy to make if you039re handy with a whisk. I was careful to add the mixture to my yolks very gradually. And keeping my whites refrigerated seemed to help the meringue set up better. I039ve made it with and without crust and love it both ways.REVThe filling is good but my mirange didn039t set up. I followed the instructions.REVPie shell...how about it,do you have directions for it or only for fillingREVI loved this pie just as it is written because I prefer something denser that I can actually cut into a pretty slice and my spoon still goes right through. But my husband preferred his grandmother''s version understandable, and she only uses a 13 cup of flour and does not bring it to a boil, just to the point of thickening. She also said that she forgot all about adding any salt. Hers tastes great, but it did not cut into actual slices.REVThis didn''t turn out good for me either, same as Katybird.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made sure to stir continuously using a wooden spoon in a nonstick pan on medium heat and I couldn''t even let it come to a boil as it was thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan.  So I went ahead and put half into a bowl with the egg yolks stirred well return egg mixture to pan, still stirring continuously it was starting to smooth out but then before it could reach boiling point, it started thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan again and cramping my hand.  Please give me suggestions as to what may have caused this or how to prevent that from happening should I try and make it again in the future.  Thanks, ReginaREVJust wasn''t chocolatey enough for us ... It just wasn''t as good as I anticipated.REVThe recipe has turned out great for me. The taste is chocolaty rich!!! First time at baking a chcolate pie without using a boxed pudding. Loved it. Easy to follow recipe too. Thank you.REVLoved this pie the flavor was just what I was looking for.  DH wanted a chocolate Meringue Pie and this fit the bill.  My only problem and it''s probably my technique as I''m new to this was that it wasn''t firm enough to hold it''s shape when cut.  I''m thinking maybe I didn''t cook it long enough but will be making this again and I''m sure perfection will come with practice.  That said the flavor of the rich chocolate can''t be beat.  Thanks Carole for a wonderful recipe.REVwhen i made this pie,i forgot to add the butter and vanilla,just didn''t read very carefully,and i didn''t know if i should have baked the pie crust before adding the mixture.i put the filling in the crust and baked it for about 10 minutes took it out and let it cool a little bit then put the meringue on top,the pie turned out just GREAT i can''t believe that anyone hasn''t rated before now.the only reason that i rated it a four is because of the confusion with the crustREVMade it this morning but used my own meringue recipe.The pie was gorgeous,not overly sweet,very creamy but firm enough to set beautifully.My husband a confirmed chocaholic gave a satisfied groan as he tasted it!
Really easy, I recommend it.REVChocolate lovers you gotta try this one!  This pie is so rich and chocolatey.  It more than satisfied my chocolate fix.REVThis was easy and excellent. The chocolate part is a dense, rich pudding, not fluffy. I used 12 tsp of white vinegar since I didn''t have cream of tartar.REVI have recommended this recipe and would like to add this was by far the easiest chocolate pie I''ve made.  I used 4 yolks in pie and used corn starch for meringue, they both worked great.REVI grew up loving my Grandmother''s Chocolate cream pie. I never thought I could ever make one as good as hers. Well, this is IT! This easy to follow recipe and well balance ingedents make this a keeper! Thanks Carole ReuREVThe best chocolate pie EVER! It was awesome and easy.REVThis was a great pie very easy, and it tasted just like my grandma used to make. Also, the chocolate and sugar combination was perfect..REVI am sorry but this did not turn out for me at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up with a super thick mixture of goo that I could barely get a spoon through.  I think if I had used a lot less flour it might have turned out better but as written it just did not work for me.REVThis pie was beautiful.  Everyone loved it.  I did have a syruptype liquid at the bottom of pie.  This may have been from my meringue or something I did wrong.

The only two additions I make are 2 tbsp grated onion mixed in with everything else and a sprinkling of Old Bay or J.O.''s on the top before baking.

I made this for a barbaque this labor day it was so easy and fast to prepare.  I subsituted the dry  mustard for regular mustard and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt I also added extra cheese and crab meat was a hit everone wanted this recipe. I want to say thanks for making me look so good.   
REVA BIT HIT!!!! This is absolutely fantastic. I made this for Thanksgiving guest and served with different types of gourmet crackers. Everyone kept saying how wonderful this was. Needless to say it went fast. I doubled the ingredients to make twice as much and all the measurements worked fine. I did add a little more cheddar cheese to the dip...just about 2 more TBSP because I love cheese and apparently so does everyone else. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!REVThis taste great!!!!!! Even my 3yr. old loved itREVOutstanding dip for chips, but especially broc and cauliflower...My coworkers got most of it, but not before I at least got a decent taste. Thanx for a great recipe !REVGood stuff. Very good stuff.REVVery good and EASY to make.  This was a big hit with everyone.  A few of them even said, it was the best crab dip they ever tasted!!!REVmade this for superbowl sunday  everyone RAVED about how wonderful it was!!!  several people even asked for the recipe.  positively THE BEST crab dip I have ever had!!!!!  A new staple in my recipe book!!!!REVAbsolutely fantastic!!  I had to use prepackaged crab meat as fresh was unavailable, and it turned out great!  When it finished cooking, I put in into a hollowed out bread loaf french bread, and used the left over bread cut up as dipping pieces  WOW!!  This was a hit with my guests!  I will definately make this again.REVThis has replaced my staple crab dip and I may not make it again.REVThis was excellent.  I made for a work pot luck and it was scarfed down in no time.  I used imitation crab meat , fresh minced garlic and substituted TexMex cheese for the cheddar.  I will make this again for sure.  Easy and delicious.REVI used 12 imitation crab and 12 salad sized shrimp and added some old bay seasoning for some spice. I made a casserole dish of it for a pot luck party,it was gone! all of it, there were people eating as sandwiches they liked it so much!REVThis was really good.  I used a pound of crabmeat and it was delicious.  Next time I will add some finely chopped onions.
JudiREVQuick,easy and delicious!REVThis is the best crab dip. The only substitution I made was to use 12 t. minced garlic and regular salt. Yummy and I served with assorted crackers. My family and I give it top honors. Thanks for sharing this.REVThis crap dip recipe has replaced our spinach con queso for a while! This was so good with big wheat crackers. Everything about it was great! Nice ans salty too! The way a dip should be!REVThe kids  I had this for supper last night, using fresh broccoli for dipping. I had to use 2 cans of drained crab meat 4.25oz each, which made the texture a bit weird, but the flavor was divine. I look forward to someday making this with fresh crabmeat. The combo with the broccoli flavor was a good one, but I might try celery next time to get more of the solo dip flavor.REVThis was wonderful, and so easy to make I could almost do it with my eyes closed! I tried to keep this lower fat to stay close to my diet, so I used fatfree mayo, fatfree cream cheese, and fatfree cheddar in this, and it still tasted fantastic! I did go ahead and mix all the cheese into the dip before heating since fatfree cheese doesn''t like to melt on top but will when it is stirred into a dish. It warmed up very nicely and was great on crackers! Thanks for a great recipe!REVMy girlfriend has a source of fresh crab on a regular basis and since I have found recipezaar she phones me weekly and we always chat about the new crab recipes that I have found before the conversation is over. Thankfully she also shares because this sounds wonderful.REVThanks for the wonderful recipe! I used fresh Dungeness crab and everyone loved it! This recipe is definitely a keeper!REVThis was gone in a matter of minutes on xmas eve.  I too used imitation crab meat, and it tasted like the real deal!  I baked a loaf of french bread for dipping, yummy!REVExcellent crab dip. Rich and creamy. The worcestershire really adds to the flavor. We spread this on our favorite crackers and that was our dinner. Yummy!! Appreciate the recipe.REVI can''t believe how many reviews this dip has gotten, so I had to try it myself.  It disappeared before my very eyes!  I would definitely add diced onions, more garlic, and some cayenne or something to give it a kick...REVI needed another dip for a party that I was having and I made this one.  It was a big hit and my party guests kept talking about it all night. REVAmazing crab dip! I served this as sort of a side dish with some broiled shrimp and we really enjoyed the flavor. I didn''t change a thing, it isn''t necessary. Thanks for posting.REVAfter all the great reviews this has received, I was expecting an out of this world dip.  However, I was very disappointed with the final result when I prepared this.  It came out really soupy and was very greasy...I''m not sure why as I only lightly greased the casserole.  I might try this again to see if I get different results...if so, I''ll revise my review.  REVThis dip was a big hit during Thanksgiving.  I served it with some toasted bread as an appetizer and my guest just loved it.  I used imitation crab meat instead and it was still GREAT!  REVMade this for a small gathing of friends this past week, and everyone just raved about it.  It was gone in no time, and they were still asking for more!  The only change I made was adding about 34 cup of grated parmesan cheese.  Very, very yumpy....  Thanks for the great recipe!REVGreat recipe!  It went very quickly at my recent dinner party.  I did use 1 clove of garlic, minced, salt, about a tablespoon of minced onion, and a dash of hot pepper sauce.  I didn''t have any milk, but it didn''t seem to need it.  I also added a little extra cheddar cheese.REVThis is a fairly good dip but it needed more flavor and I would have liked it to have been a little hotter.  Maybe I''ll add hot sauce next time as another reviewer suggested.  I did substitute minced garlic for the garlic salt, doubled the recipe, and heated it in my crockpot for about 3 hours.REVI brought this to a hurricane party, and I swear I turned around and it was gone! Everyone ate the dip as fast as I put in on the table! People were ranting and raving about how good it was. Thank you so much for your post!REVThis was a pretty good dip, but I find that it is lacking something and I just don''t know what. The tangysour flavor from the cream cheese,sour cream and lemon juice was certainly overpowering the whole dip. It needed something with a spicy taste, I think, to balance the flavor. Also, The cheese I had melted on topcheddar had a layer of oil from cooking.After it had cooled a little the whole top layer of cheese came off in one piece. Maybe next time if I remake itI will mix all the cheese in to the main mix. Other than those small flaws it was edible and the flavor of the crab meat really came through.REVthis is the best I''ve had in a long time. just needed a little pinch of red pepper to my taste.');

Light and nice for a warm summer afternoon.REVI used the juice of just 1 orange in part because I only had balsamic vinegar and I thought the sweetness would be enough. I decided to wilt my bok choy a bit in the same pan I did the chicken in, and tossed it with the dressing in that pan. I also used bamboo shoots and some baby corn.

The second time I made it, I didn''t have anymore mushrooms so I subbed some shredded zucchini, and had run out of walnuts as well. It was just as good though! I recommend mixing the shredded cheese in a little not just topping it, only thing I do differently!REVI made this almost as the recipe called for. I only had cheddar and pecans on hand and so used those as a sub. If serving as a vegetarian meal, walnuts are the way to go as walnuts are an essential part of a vegetarians diet.

It combines sweet like sweet potatoes, Oriental and a stuffinglike taste. I do not believe the combination works at all.  It would work better to pick one of the styles, instead of combining tastes that don''t work well together. 

Stuffing Style remove the brown sugar and soy sauce, add some soft breadcrumbs, double the basil.

Oriental Style substitute almonds for walnuts, remove brown sugar and basil.

Sweet Style remove soy sauce and basil. Increase the brown sugar.REVI can''t believe I haven''t rated this before now.

The melted muenster cheese really topped it off well.  I think I''ll be making it again this week as we''re getting more squash in our CSA delivery box.  Thanks for posting it!REVThis was my first time making acorn squash, and was looking for a nonsweet, vegetarian recipe. This was the one I went with. The results were ohsogood! Although next time I will follow the recipe more closely, I did have to make a few small changes because in each case I didn''t have fresh onhand I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I soaked and finely chopped, frozen broccoli, and dried basil I also added some dried parsley. I didn''t have walnuts so I had to omit those. I''m a vegan, so instead of using muenster, I used a vegan cheddar cheese that is made by Follow Your Heart, and instead of butter, I used a vegan margerine. The results were still amazing. I will make this again, next time with allfresh ingredients. REVI thought this was great, but made a few minor changes. I used olive oil instead of butter healthier and sharp cheddar instead of muenster cheese. Next time I make it there will be a next time! I would scoop out some of the softened squash and mix it with the filling prior to topping with cheese. It was a nice mix of flavors, and the splash of soy sauce gave it more of a depth of flavor. REVExcellent recipe!  I couldn''t find any muenster cheese so I used aged gouda and it was very tasty.REVThis was great!  I hate to be one of those people but I did have to make a couple of changes since I had to use what was onhand.  I didn039t have broccoli so I substituted about 112 cups of swiss chard, and let me tell you, that was an EXCELLENT choice!  I might actually do this every time.  I also had to use pecans instead of walnuts no big deal and I used a combination of ricotta and mozzarella instead of muenster cheese.  The cheeses were a BIG success as well.  I feel like my substitutions didn039t change the recipe too much, so I feel confident in giving this a 5star rating.

Once again DA!!! kenk, thanks for the recipe!REVI''m sure mine didn''t turn out the way intended, as I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces since I don''t like large bites of potato. Then, on top of doing that, I left them in the water after boiling, until I was ready for them, I knew all along what the result might be, based on the things I was doing lol. I considered posting my result on here as a new recipe, but realized that really, it''s still the same recipe, with a slight variation, so others can choose which way they''re in the mood for, each time they make it. What happened was that as I was mixing everything together, yes, go figure, the potatoes started falling apart. So, I ended up with something between mashed potatoes  potato salad, only far more garlicky, but very good. Oh,  I did add a tad of dried dill, sweet basil  white pepper. My son had wanted hamburgers, but I didn''t want to serve the typical chips, or fries or macaroni  cheese with them, so when I found this recipe I thought it would be a nice fit, a little less plain. I also served it with my Caribbean Coleslaw recipe 290325 which was nice  light which helped balance out the garlic flavor. For desert I served my Rocky Road Chocolate Mousse 286486 which was nice, because it was cool  light,  we could each choose how much we wanted, I only had a little because by that time I was very full duh.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe that was simple and apparently infallible lol!REVMMMMM we loved this recipe!REVYummy....this was absolutely wonderful.  Prepared like FoodExplorer. as I have a heavy hand with potatoes, and didn''t want them to mush up.   However, I did not bake them in the oven.  I microwaved them a few minutes to precook a tad before I sliced them.  The sauce was brilliant.  Thnx for posting kenk.REVReally wonderful side dish.  Went together fast.  Will definitely make again!REVWow these potatoes are fantastic!  So easy to prepare and a great side dish for the summer.  I will definitely make these again!REVTastes good, but nothing much to rave about. Pretty easy recipe. Also, I have tried this with both parsley and cilantro, and I think the cilantro gives it a better taste.REVA great recipe.  When I was in Spain, we ate this all the time at our favorite bar.  The owner''s secret was to use a bay leaf in the potatoes while you are boiling them.  It adds just a little background flavor.REVI love garlic, so I added another clove. Garlic lovers unite!REVDelicious!  I used red potatoes and homemade mayonnaise made with lemon juice and high quality safflower oil.  Also, I increased the amount of parsley by 1 tbsp.  Highly recommended!REVOne of the best tapas during my tapas party. Simple to make,big garlic flavor for all garlic lovers out there !REVI had this dish at a funeral luncheon, and had to find a recipe for it. This is very easy to make  I just wing the quantities when cooking for myself  as I039d eat four servings if they were in front of me.REVThanks for easy and good recipe!  I used the recommended lemon juice to thin out the mayo.  It had a nice garlic flavor and made a great addition to the potluck I took it to.REVI was about to post this when I saw you''d beaten me to it! 

We really enjoyed this. It had a great flavor and texture. She recommends using homemade mayonnaise she also recommends using Spanish ingredients when available. Great with a glass of red wine or sangria! Also makes a nice side disha refreshing change from Americanstyle potato salad.REVI really liked this. Instead of boiling the potatoes, I fried them. It was faster this way. They ended up tasting cheesy. I would have never imagines they would taste this good. The reason I''m only giving it a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 is because they were very greasy.REVI loved these!  Such a simple recipe and so much flavor.  Thanks for sharing.REVMmm this was wonderful.  We roasted the potatoes but made the aioli as directed, adding a little bit of lemon juice to lowfat mayonnaise.  The flavour was awesome. I was going to halve the recipe because there are only 2 of us but since there was only 12 cup left in the jar I used it all.  I''m glad I did, I can''t wait to use it again!REVMade this lovely potato dish for dinner tonight, it was fantastic!! A garlic lover''s dish, simple to make and simple to enjoy!!  This will become a summer regular in hour hourse, heck probably an all year long regular!!Thanks for sharing.REVOutstanding!! What a delicious dipping sauce.

I served this with steak and salad for a delicious quick and easy meal, thanks for sharing.REVI was bored with mashed, baked, boiled, and roasted potatoes.

My husband, my 3 year old and my 1 12 year old loved them.  I''m making them again tomorrow!!!REVGreat potato recipeinstead of boiling and chopping up the potatoes, I baked them and cut them horizontally into circles.  Then I placed them on a greased cookie sheet, brushed them with olive oil and a little bit of salt and broiled them until the skins were crispy.  I served them with the sauce as listed in the recipe, which I made early and let sit for a while so the flavors could meld.
I made these with fried chicken, green beans and biscuits... thank you!! REVyummy yummy!!! I couldn''t keep my fingers out of the mayo mixture. I also added a touch of dry sherry, all I had. I have been looking for something like this for ages, and now i can have my fix anytime. It''s so simple i''m suprised i never thought of it. Thank you very much for posting, will be making again and again. Foodlover1REVWe loved how this tasted.  We are on Weight Watchers and used low calorie mayo and it still came out excellent.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!REVWonderful!  I used roasted garlic and added some citrus lime juice as suggested.  I made enough for fourthey were sorry I didn''t make more...REVExcellent recipe!

I used Granny Smith and Braeburn apples, cut the butter back to around 4 tablespoons and used a bit more flour, brown sugar, and oatmeal  than the recipe called for. This was great and lasted a week in our fridge just fine.REVI used Haralson apples and got rave reviews.  My only quibble was that a 9x13 pan is too big for this recipe.  The topping didn''t fully cover the pan and the apples cooked down so that it was barely a quarter inch think.  I''d either double the recipe or use a smaller pan.REVI love the texture of the topping, and the flavor of the nuts is yummy! I thought while I was making it that I should spice up the topping, which would still be tasty, but leaving it without the extra spices let the flavor of the nuts come through.

Awesome recipe!REVI followed the directions except that I left out the walnuts.  It was very good!REVThis recipe turned out great! It tasted delicious! I substituted lime juice instead of lemon, and I didn''t have enough topping for a 9x13 pan, but I quickly and easily whipped up a second batch in my food processor to cover the rest of the pan. Reason for this could be that I was eating it while slicing apples   I served it with vanilla bean ice cream and warm caramel syrup drizzled over the top. I also sprinkled some cinnamon over the ice cream and garnished with cinnamon sticks. Delicious!REVTakes a little more time to make but it is totally worth it!!

She does make a few changes though  in oat mixture she only used 4 Tbs butter and puts the extra 2 Tbs in with the apple mixture.  She only uses 4 c apples  I think because we enjoy more topping and doesn''t use lemon juice or walnuts, but I think I will try it next time!  She also uses an 8x8 dish.  Thanks, this recipe is a keeper for sure!REVI couldn''t find my Mom''s recipe for apple crisp, and I knew she wasn''t home yet, so I couldn''t call to get it from her.  So, I found this one, and it''s just as good!  Perfect time of year for apple anything, and the oats and brown sugar go so well together.  I think I could justify eating this for breakfast. Thanks for the recipe. Oh, I used closer to ten apples, but they were on the smallish side.REVI chose this recipe over another because it uses less butter. It was great! I used Granny Smith apples and omitted the walnuts. Topped it with homemade whipped cream and it was just what I wanted. Reminded me of the apple crisp I used to eat as a kid.REVJust what I was looking for.  I try to avoid butter, so I substituted with lowfat yogurt butter and it was fabulous.  Didn''t even miss it.

Carole in OrlandoREVI tagged this recipe knowing that it was one of your adoptees and you hadn''t made it yet.  I would never have made this as written.  It is my belief, and only my belief, veggies in a frittata should be crisp tender.  Hope you don''t mind that I took some liberty with this recipe.  I sliced the squash thin and added some green onions and red bell pepper.  Cooked the onion and bell pepper for a few minutes in a lightly buttered cast iron skillet, added the squash and cooked to wilt.  Poured the eggs mixture of egg substitute mixed with 1 tablespoon crme fraiche, black pepper and Italian seasoning over the veggies.  Cooked, lifting egg to allow the uncooked portion to go to the bottom of the pan.  When eggs were almost set, I topped them off with freshly grated parmesan cheese and placed under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  The family enjoyed this served with fresh biscuits.REVMy husband loves squash so he made this for himself today. He also followed PaulaG''s lead and sauteed the squash till crisptender instead of boiling it. It''s also better cut into rings instead of diced small, for texture. He used egg subsitute and omitted the cheese to knock off all that cholesterol, so this was much healthier. This made a delicious satisfying brunch for him.REVThis Yellow Squash Frittata was Yummy!  I used the creme fraiche made from scratch.  Served the squash dish with a roll of buttered lefse.  A real treat.');

Thanks!REVI followed the original recipe, but added a grated garlic clove, after reading the reviews.  I enjoyed the moist texture but will add sweet corn kernels to give it more of a hushpuppielike taste.  I will also do a teaspoon size dollop, should cook through more evenly, I think.  A great way to use the plethera of yellow squash I have in my freezer from this summers garden!REVThese are a family favorite!  I also add some cayenne pepper when certain ones will not be eating this... I enjoy the little bounce of flavor... also, use white cornmeal as the meal will not color the yellow squash.  You should try these with a little hand grated cheddar added to the batter... Yummy!REVDelicious! I did take the suggestion of another poster and added some sweet kernel corn. I think that next time, in order to cut back on the fat, I''ll add a little oil to the batter and try to bake these.REVFantastic!  I made these to use up some yellow squash and zucchini.  I made quantity for 6 servings, added a whole can of corn, and a tablespoon of sugar.  Served alongside baked fish sticks.REVMy family loved these things... !  I made them even more delish by using lard. Yes, that four letter word. Try it and I promise the final result will not seem so greasy or heavy after you''ve eaten a dozen!  This recipe should definitely be doubled in order to make a decent amount. I used about 4 medium sized squash to do it and then food processed the squash to make it nice and mashed. Also food processed the onions.REVThis was delicious. It reminded me of hushpuppies. I added alittle celery seed to the batter for alittle extra flavor. 
I thought I made a review for this but don''t see it listed so I am adding another. 
I shared a few puffs with a friend and she just had to have the recipe, she loved them too. This is a keeper!! Thanks for posting a neat way to use squash. REVThese are delicious!  I made them as written but plan on try some of the suggestions of the other reviewers, especially adding southwestern flavors and sweet corn to the batter.  This was an excellent recipe to help me use up the bumper crop of yellow squash coming out of my garden.  Thanks Riffraff br82611Adding stars and also want to comment that these reheat really well, SO, since we''re getting so sick and tired of squash been eating it for 3 weeks now, I''m going to make a huge batch of these and freeze them to eat during the winter, I''m sure we''ll love squash again in January!!REVYellow squash are my favorite squash.  I would simplify it by using selfrising flour.  I would also fry the puffs in Ghee, for extra flavor.  By the way, thanks for the new word offal to be added to my vocabulary, pronounces the same as awful.REVThese are really tasty! I think we''ll try adding hot sauce next time we make them.REVReally enjoyed this.  I added a little less onion and then put in onion powder instead, just simply because I wanted my children to eat them.  I also put the smashed squash into a stainer and shook out excess water.REVThese puffed up nice. I modified the recipe slightly for my picky eater. DD loved the hush puppies served on our summer vacation down south. I omitted the onion and added about     1 c.whole kernel sweet corn in its place. I doubled the recipe and used a whole medium fresh squash, shredded, with skin on in the food processor using the grating attachment no prior cooking required!. ltbrgtMy DS wanted ketchup on his, we also had some with honey.This is a really fun way to use up a little yellow squash and get some veggies in otherwise because they wouldn039t eat squash knowing it was in  there. ltbrgtThanks for sharing.REVTasty little puffs! I would add a little more seasoning next time, maybe cayenne or thyme and maybe make them a little smaller. Great way to use up all those yellow squash that are around this time of year. Thanks for posting.REVThanks for posting this very yummy recipe.  I added 2 teaspoons of sugar because I like sweet cornbread and I grated a clove of garlic to even out the onion...It was just great!  Thanks again!REVTasty little things, but mine were more flat like a pancake or latke. Not sure why they lost their shape. I used an electric skillet and thought it worked pretty slick.REVfirst off, i replaced cornmeal w cornflour, so maybe this is why i had creamy centers...but, it just didnt work for me. Hardly any flavor. REVThis sounds really GOOD!!!  Thank you, I need all the recipes for yellow squash I can get... can''t wait to make it!REVThese taste very good, and are a nice way to use up the yellow squash abundance from summer gardens.  They don''t taste like squash, which would be appealing for those who don''t care for yellow squash.  I agree that they could work nicely as a substitute for hush puppies.REVyummy!  A good way to hide veggies from kids since they look and taste like hushpuppies!  We loved themREVVery yummy......... my kids loved it!  But for me??  To high in calories!!! REVeveryone will love these as an alternative to the someimes dry hushpuppies.  If you''d like to have a little more zing to your squash puffs  substitute fish fry instead of the cornmeal...this gives it a little more seasoning with some spice to it.REVMy 6 year old loved them. I made a few changes because I didn''t have cornmeal in the house. I used whole wheat bread crumbs and for the onion I used 2 Tablespoons of parmasan cheese. Thanks for a great kid friendly recipe.REVMy boys looked at these and said is there squash in here?....ooohhh they are getting better about finding those hidden vegetables.  BUT they loved them and I had no leftovers....Thanks for a great recipe!REVI tried this recipe over the weekend. I thought I had some cornmeal but when I opened the bag, I wasn''t sure if it was still good. So since I already had the recipe started I just added some extra flour.  Needless to say, the puffs were pretty doughy on the inside. Maybe it would be better with the cornmeal. I may try again another time.REVI would probably call these fritters more than puffs, but they were delicious no matter what you call them! I loved them on their own, but I also tried this mixture as a batter for deepfried zucchini and it is great for that, too. The main key there is not to put too much batter on the zucchini because the corn flavor can kind of overpower the zucchini. REVThese were very good.  Good for using up squash.  Thanks for posting.REVWe have made these a bunch of times and love them! Great way to get kids to eat veggies!! I''ve added cheese before and it was great!! Thanks for the recipe! One of our family favorites.REVThese were very good as the recipe stands.  We made two batches.  In the second batch we cut the cornmeal with breadcrumbs which lightened it up some and added southwestern ingredients like finely chopped jalapeno and green onion, garlic powder, cayene pepper, paprika and cumin.  We just put enough dough for one or two in separate bowl and everyone added what they thought would be good.  We also had various dipping sauces available.  The southwestern flavors dipped in ranch won the day. Thanks riffraff for a good recipe using up some of the garden squash as well as a couple of hours entertainment for the family.REVthese were great. i used Jiffy cornbread mix,prepared as on the box, lots of onion powder, some cayenne, and a lil hot salsa that was left in the fridge. the squash gave this a nice texture, and a way to get my bf to eat the squash. i ate them with a lil maple syrup, n he dipped his in a bit of ketchup. this one''s a keeper!REVAwesome recipe!  I did alter it a bit and used about 3 onions and then served them with sour cream and hot sauce.  That combination really brings out the flavor.REVThese were wonderful!  Super easy to make!!  My 5  7 year old even ate them.  We added a little Iowa sweet corn.  Yum!!!!REVJust made these and they remind me of potato latkes or pancakes.  They were quite tasty, but I really try to avoid frying, and that is the only criticism I have.  I wonder if spraying a broiler pan with Pam and putting them in the oven would work?  Maybe I''ll try that the next time I want to make these when I have an extra supply of squash.  A friend dropped off a box maybe 100 small squashand I chose a bunch of Zaar yellow squash recipes that appealed to me.  The only problem is that I still have half a box left!  I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.  I just chopped the onion roughly, and the machine did the rest.  It makes one life a lot easier.  Thank you riffraff for the tasty and savory recipe.REVLooking for ways to use up all my summer squash, i tried these..oh my, sooo good !!!i couldnt stop eating them. I served them with a curry dipping sauce. They would make fantastic appetizers with a little green salad. I will be making these all summer long. thanks for a great recipe.');

Cap''n JackREVI took another reviewers advice and I added 1T of bourbon to the filling. I also doubled the filling except I left the white sugar at 14 cup and added 12 cup brown sugar. I used Karo brown sugar corn syrup for the dark corn syrup and added natural maple flavoring.  I added a pinch of cloves to the filling and 12t of fresh ground nutmeg. I think I only baked it about 50 minutes.REVFabulous.REVI am giving this a five star rating because to do otherwise would not be fair. I did change this greatly though.  First I used Splenda in the pumpkin layer.  Secondly I left out completely the sugar in the top layer and used only the corn syrup.  The results a lower carb version and less sweet.  I was recieved rave reviews and a thanks giving a less sweet option.REVMy husband started the day a week or two ago saying he wanted sweet potato pie so we went looking for one to make.  I took a Pillsbury crust from the freezer and let it defrost while we searched.  We came across this one and he decided instantly that it was what he wanted.  We really enjoyed it, but thought that there was not enough sweet potato filling.  Next time we''d double the sweet potato part and leave the pecan topping the same.  It really is the best of both worlds, though!REVMy husband''s comment This is definitely a doover!  Delicious!  Tasted like a pecan pie with a little texture of pumpkin pie.  I added more of each spice, used brown sugar instead of white, and half corn syruphalf maple syrup recommended by another reviewer.  While the filling wasn''t supershallow in the pie dish, I would agree with other''s recommendations to doubleincrease the filling.  This is such a good pie you''re going to want more of it anyways!REVVery delicious and great combination of sweet potato and pecan. Perfect level of sweetness.REVI really like this.  Sometimes a pecan pie is a little too much for me and this had such a nice layered flavor.REVWe love this!  Made it for second Thanksgiving in a row.  This year I made some changes  used maple syrup instead of the corn syrup and put a tablespoon of bourbon in the sweet potato portion which I doubled to fit into a 10 inch deep dish pie.

We had pork satay, and I used the sauce from that for both dishes.REVI love GadoGado and this is a very good recipe.   I sometimes put the salad on a bed of Watrecress when available  Thanks CarolREVMy husband and I lived in Malaysia for 4 years and became WELL acquainted with the local food.  We loved GadoGado which is Indonesian but the Malay love it also and it is seen on many restaurant menus throughout the country.  Southeast Asians normally peel their cucumbers but since we hae returned to living in the states I DON''T, not only because of the nutrient value, but also it adds color to the salad.  I also add shredded carrots to the salad for the same reason but keep the rest of the veggies most like how it was served in Malaysia and Indonesia. 3  The secret to having the BEST GadoGado is the fresh peanut sauce that is used as the dressing.  If making it fresh isn''t your thing, try using Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce found in your local Safeway store in the Ethic region.  It''s the most like the IndonesianMalay sauce served with this salad.  MOST recipes in Malaysia include Tofu cut into small cubes, dusted in cornstarch and fried up in a wok and then added on top of the salad just before serving.  It''s wonderful!!

It ended up better than I''d get at a restaurant!REVThe first time I made this, it was a little bland. This time I added cranberries halfway through cooking and more crushed red pepper... maybe not as authentic, but the cranberries really added depth! It was great, and went over well with my critic. REVFantastic tasty meal, I made some chipati to accompany it, but used cauliflower rice instead of cauliflower florets, and added a teaspoon of curry powder to taste just before the end.REVThis was a good standard. I felt like it was missing something...I can''t put my finger on it. I followed another reviewers advice and added a sprinkling of garam masala, but I guess I didn''t add enough. Made a nice healthy meal complemented by Recipe 21855REVall i could taste was lime REVit was ok.REVPretty bland, but that may be the fault of six cups of rice.

This recipe is easy to follow with simple ingredients which are easy to find at most grocery stores.

It039s great served with a spicy main I served it with a very hot chicken tikka masala amp some rice. Overall good but I think I will add more cauliflower next time.REVTerrific recipe! I followed other peoples suggestions and used broth instead of water and added a teaspoon of garam Marsala. Excellent!  I made it for a dinner party and had to share the recipe with everyone.  This digs was. A hit!REVSo good, I made it 7 weeks in a row and never got sick of it. I use ground cumin, frozen cauliflower florets, canned diced tomatoes and add 1 tsp of veggie Better than Bouillon to the water. I also let it cook on medhigh for 1520 minutes and the lentils turn out nice and mushy like at restaurants. I rave about this recipe to everyone I know.REVThis was amazing!

used vegetable stock instead of water and added chopped carrot and peas to up the veggy quota. Oh and grind the cumin seedsor use pre ground as it gets a fuller flavour then but otherwise YUMMY! my kids loved it, as did I. 
I can imagine it would be a touch boring if made exact to recipe but adding stock and ground cumin gave it a lovely rich flavour. make a double batch!!!REVThis recipe makes the best Dal I''ve had at home ever... and it''s so authentic! It reminds me of the Dal I used to have at my best friend''s place during my school days. The only possible change I''d make is to increase the amount of red peppers for a little more ''heat''. Also, you can omit the rice, and drink this as a wonderful lentil soup. It''s great for when you have a really bad cold, and need something to warm you up. Thanks for sharing this one... I''m sooo gonna make it over and over!REVThis dish was incredibly tasty and easy to make as well! I substituted broccoli for the cauliflower that''s the only thing I had on hand and added a bit more red pepper because I like my dal spicy. Altogether a great recipe . . . all my roommates loved the smell and the taste!REVI made this recipe for some guests who had spent time in India.  They couldn''t beleive how great it was!  I modified by cooking in pressure cooker for about 10 minutes at high pressure.  I allowed the guests to add more heat by having Thai spicy sauce on the side.  A DEFINITE WINNER!REVenjoyed this very much, I usually puree my dal, but this is much nicer.  Thank youREVThis makes a very attractive dish.  I made it pretty much as the recipe called for.  If I were change anything, I might add additional red pepper flakes.  Other than that this was very good.REVThis recipe is simply delicious.

My husband and I had it with some tandoori pork chops and rice.REVThis is a family favourite in our house. I originally got it from Cooking Light but was happy to find it here on ''Zaar. I usually use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and double the ginger. I serve with basmati rice, a big dollop of plain yoghurt, and microwaved pappadums. I sometimes partially puree this. I usually use red lentils, but see in the pictures some people have used brown. Might try that for something different!REVI just made this for dinner, it was so easy and fast, I didn''t add Cauliflower didn''t have anyand added ground coriander didn''t have fresh. I added a little more salt, to my taste. It only took about 15 min of cooking which was great. I love the colour, texture and taste. Next time I might experiment with adding other spices like garramasala and curry powder for added idian flavours. I love it thank you so much.REVGaram Masala was essential. It was lacking something without it, I also used fresh jalepenos. I served coriander chutney available on the side as well and I made home made naan to go with it. I also used yellow split peas instead of lentils a little less lime juice and after everything was suatee''d I threw it in the crock pot.REVGreat dal.  I needed a basic dal I took out the cauliflower for my rice with a veg dish and this was just perfect.REVThis was pretty good, I have been searching for a good dhal recipe. I liked the added cauliflower  tomato. My husband thinks a little spinach at the end would be nice as well. It made a huge pot which we ate for lunch the next day and still leftovers!REVIt turned out good, I forgot the ginger and it would have been better had I added it.  I also pureed it when it was done and mixed the rice into the puree...it tasted great.REVI''ve never had Lentil Dal before. It was fairly bland to me, from my experience with curry type dishes. I do love the idea that it is a healthy vegetarian dish.  I would make it again for myself since I love to eat healthy, but I would never make it for company or a hot date.REVLovely flavours,I,ll be having this again.
Just serve with rice or Naan, it was deliciousREVI was a bit doubtful that all the rave reviews could be right  but they were!  A very, very nice dal.  I used puy lentils so the cooking time more than doubled and the cauliflower was overcooked.  I hardly ever follow recipes exactly but with this one I did and personally wouldn''t change a thing.

I reduced the red peppers I used cayenne to just a dash because I was worried that it would be too spicy, but the spices mellow a lot during cooking.

Thank you very much.REVThese were good and had a nice flavor to them. I followed the recipe exactly as written but I too used frozen already chopped potatoes.REVThese were great. I followed your recipe exactly and we thought the spicing was perfection. Thanks for sharing this one!REVCubed the potatoeseveryone loved them!!! REVI used a 1 lb. frozen organic hash brown mix from my freezer and halved the rest of the ingredients.  I chose this recipe because I had everything available on my kitchen shelf and was low fat to boot.  I allowed my hashed browns to defrost quite a bit before cooking, used a small casserole dish, substituted cayenne pepper powder for red pepper, and cooked for recommended length of time.  This made the top nice and brown, and under layers soft.  Served with extra hot sauce, yum!  Easy, quick, and healthful!REVExcellent Hash Browns! These turned out great and tasted even better! Thanks Malarkey Test....REVThese hash browns are to die for!!!  I am on a very low carb diet and just one bite and I kept eating them against my will!  Spicy enough that my husband liked them and not so spicy that my little boy scarfed them down as well.  VERY GOOD RECIPE!!!!REVThese were excellent although they weren''t as spicy as I thought they would be.  For us, they could be spiced up quite a bit and this recipe is so easy that we were able to do so with no problem.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!REVI cheated and used frozen cubed potatoes and the same spices and they were really tasty. Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will make them again.');

It was so easy to make.  I didn''t use the raisins.  While it was baking the whole house smelled like apples.  This will be added to my favorites.  Thank you for a great recipe.REVI found the pie to be very good.  I did accidently, on purpose, omit the 34 cup surgar.  Just sounded like too much sugar.  It would have taken the guess work out of it if the baking time had been included in the recipe.  I also, baked for about 45 miunutes.  I would bake again.   And again, would leave out the 34 cup of sugar.REVeveryone LOVED this.  it''s very sweet even though i, too, omitted the extra 34 cup sugar.  i did not have fresh nutmeg, but used organic, and the spice mixture was wonderful.  it''s great as a dessert with whipped cream, or as a nice breakfast with tea.  the directions do not mention where to add the butter, i just mixed it in with the other wet ingredients before blending with the dry.  thank you so much for posting this!  i will be making for Thanksgiving this year!REVloved it!!! I did not add the 34 cup of sugar, as did some others, just sounded to sweet for our taste.  But over all awesome dish!REVthis was wonderful warm with cream for sweets tonight. i left out the peacans as my family doesnt appreciate nuts but they really loved this piecake  many thanks for a delious recipeREVThe flavor of this was good, but the making of it didn''t go very well.  There were a lot of steps, which isn''t necessarily a  bad thing, but it didn''t fall together like most cake recipes.  For example, I couldn''t figure out why I had to melt the butter and of course cool it when I was just creaming it, or why add the sugar in two parts.   I had tons of tunnels.  And it would be helpful if there was a number for how long to bake.  At least a range, especially for us novice cooks.   It took 45 minutes for me.REVthis  was a real hit, i also omitted the 34 cup of sugar and the raisins. i also used chopped almonds instead of pecans, cause that is was i had on hand. i will make it again.');

Thank you for posting!REVAlthough the baked casserole looked great, this recipe did not work for us because 1. the taste of sage was very overpowering, and 2. the overall texture was like StoveTop Cornbread Stuffing with hot dog pieces stirred in. Making a halfbatch trial run of the recipe might be a good idea for firsttimers.REVReal good recipe and easy and quick to make. With the sage, it tasted like cornbread stuffing with hot dogs.
I questiond the 2 boxes of Jiffy Mix since mine were only 8 oz each, but it worked out perfectly.REVThis was tasty. I love corn dogs, though. I omitted celery and the sage and used vegetarian hot dogs. Tasted greatjust like a corndog.REVSorry, this casserole didn''t have enough flavor for me.  My grandson, who loves corn dogs didn''t even care for it.REVThis was really good.  You don''t have to be a kid to like this.  I did add garlic, just because I love garlic and use it in everything.

This recipe makes for a lot of good eats!  It baked up nicely and tasted great!  There isn''t a thing I''d change about this keeper!  Thanks so much for posting your recipe, it was really good REVI tried this years ago when I first started getting TOH magazine. It''s a really nice comfort foodtype dish! REVYummy! I used fat free hot dogs, egg beaters, lowfat cheese, left out the butter  just sauted the veggies in chicken broth. You couldn''t really taste the cheese  I might use less or even leave it out. Thanks  we liked the recipe a lot!REVIt was okay.. my DS liks hot dogs and cornbread, so it was a different treat for him.REVGreat recipe! I omitted the celery due to a picky 3 yr old and husband but it was still wonderful and very easy! Thank you for sharing!REVThis was really good! My 6 year old helped me make it. I used egg substitute, kosher fat free hot dogs, light cheddar and light butter substitute to make it healthier. I omitted the sage, green onion and celery because I knew my kids would not like it. We had mustard and ketchup at the table to dip. My son is taking some to school for lunch tomorrow, and he really had fun helping me make it. Thanks for the recipe! REVI am just not a big fan of this.  Everything came out just great, and my kids ate this up.  I might try adding a little garlic next time.  REVI made this in hopes of my picky kid finally liking something...to no avail.  She picked out the hot dogs and left the cornbread, LOL.  Anyway the 14 year old and I thought is was okay at best.  I didn''t include the celery or sage because that would have been a guaranteed no from picky pete.  It was quick to put together and nice baking time.REVI had such high hopes for this recipe but it was awful. No one in my house liked it at all.REVThis is a great base recipe for kids and family. I was excited when I saw it but new that for my family, green onion and sage would not work. I substituted sweet walla walla onions and added garlic powder and 1 cup frozen corn. HUGE HIT for the family. Thanks for posting!REVWe didn''t care for the overall taste  texture of this dish.  It might have been the strong taste of sage, just not our style.REVVery good I like sage and really enjoyed it in this dish. I do not eat hot dogs however, so I used veggie dogs instead. Turned out wonderfully. Also added one can of corn niblets to the batter. A tasty, healthy with veggie dogs! dish. Thank you!REVThis came out WAY better than expected and I agree with others who say it tastes a lot like a cornbread stuffing! My family devoured it! Can''t wait to make it again!REVThis was really yummy. It taste somewhat like stuffing.  My whole family really enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting this recipe.REVI''ve made this exact recipe except I used double the amount of cheese and I didn''t use the sage! This was VERY good! I made it for my kids birthday party and all the kids loved it! I used chicken franks to make it a little healthier! This worked perfectly! I added my photo!REVSuper easy to make!! Great taste!  My boyfriend loved it so much it was all gone in 2 days!! We however didn''t put in any of the vegetables and left out the sage. This is something we will definitely be making again soon!!!REVWe thought it was good, but it seemed too dry.  I think next time I am going to add some butter to it before hand.REVEasy to make, tasty, and best of all  the kids loved it!  Didn''t have any celery so just left that out!REVTasted bland, onions may have helped that, but I had to leave them out since my daughter doesn''t like them.  She wouldn''t eat it anyways.  I couldn''t even coax her to pick out and eat the hotdog pieces. I made this for her, I am not a big fan of hotdogs, and I didn''t want to eat it, so we threw it in the garbage.REVVery Tasty! My son Seth LOVED it!!!! He ate half of it because he loves corn dogs!REVIn my ongoing search for a meal my visiting DGD would eat tried this one.  She still wouldn''t touch it but the rest of us loved it what a great, easy dinner.  There was not a bite left over.  Such a differant dish with flavors that remind you of those fair corn dogs, but with enough extra to make it a meal.  I baked in an iron skillet mainly for the looks and it turned out great.  I''m sure another less picky eater will enjoy it so planning to make it again when my DGSs come to visit.REVI''ve been wanting to make this for some time because I like corn dogs, but this seems much easier and healthier. I used recipe  345502 for the Jiffy Mix. I didn''t have any green onions, so I used chopped red onion. I also added chili powder, garlic powder, and a diced jalepeno. brIt was pretty yummy and my 2 year old also approved!brThanks!REVYummy!  Actually this was a lot better than I expected.  Way more sophisticated than a corn dog and a lot more flavor too.REVI think the recipe could have called for more hot dogs and more cheese.REVthis was good, i made it for my 19 month old grand daughter and skipped the green onions and celery and she loved it.REVThis is such a good  easy recipe.  I had all the stuff on hand  my husband  I both loved it.  I added a blob of honey to the batter... mmm...  I''ve already shared this recipe with several corndogloving friends.  Thanks!!REVI was concerned about making this because my DH is not a fan of cornbread, but knew our DS''s would enjoy it. Didn''t need to worry DH gave it a thumbs up! I LOVED the sage in it, made the world of difference.
Thank You Nancy Van EssREVOur family has enjoyed this recipe, time and time again with great success. Favorite topping for this is to serve with chili, grated cheese and onions. The kids love it simply with catsup. 
Either way this dish is a MAJOR favorite of our family. Great also for the kids who are learning to cook.REVThe corn dog casserole tasted a lot like baked cornbread stuffing. I liked it and would eat it again, but it was a no go with the 10 year old. My four year old picked out the hot dogs but left most of the breading on her plate.
Also, it had to cook longer than indicated here. After 45 minutes it was done, so when you try the recipe, give yourself more time than stated.REVThis was a huge let down for my family. I think if there was not as much sage, it might be ok. But not one single person in my family liked it. I don,t mean to be negative, but honestly, this dish was awful.REVI like to make new dishes for potluck so I tried this recipe.  Everyone thought it was great and thought it was a fun and different kind of casserole.  You need to add Ketchup or BBQ sauce on the finished casserole to bring out the flavors  just like with corn dogs on a stick.REVI cut this recipe in half since its just hubbie and me. Took a little longer than listed to bake more like 3540 minutes. We both LOVED it...no other acoutriments needed...served with cole slaw.REVGreat kid pleaser meal!!I added smoked sausage for the hot dogs and it tasted greatI guess that makes it sausage casserole,huhI used Marie Callenders cornbread mixturemy favorite,this will be a regular on my table!Thanks for sharing!!!REVThis was so easy and so good! The celery added a nice flavor and texture to the dish.  Sort of tastes like a corndog without the stick!  Thanks Mysterygirl for posting another winner!REVI''ve made this recipe before and it''s super yummy if you like corn dogs!!  Serve with catsup and mustard!!!REVIt was a good easy recipe.  I learned that my son 3 is not too fond of celery yet. So we will try it again when his tastes change.REVFast and easy dish here to make.  I liked the addition of the sage.  I did not have green onions so used a white one.  Oh man, I just read DDW''s review I forgot about using catsup and mustard.    There is not even a crumb left to try catsup on!  Thanks for a great recipe that takes me right back to the Iowa State Fair and their corn dogs!REVThe title sounds peculiar but this dish is great! It''s definitely going to be a favorite of mine. Because of picky eaters I used half the amount of vegetables and half the amount of sage. I added a pinch of salt and some garlic powder. It was perfect. I also added a lot more cheese on the top than just 12 of a cup. It got toasted golden and crunchy not ooey gooey just wonderful. Also note that my dish was ready in 17 minutes, not 30! This would be a super dish to take to a potluck. I can''t wait for the opportunity. And lastly, must have mustard to dip! YUM!REVgreat recipe i made a smaller amount and left out the celery  but still a good and easy meal!REVI loved this recipe and it did taste like corn dogs. My husband gave it 5 stars so it''s a winner.REVGreat recipe  quick to make.  This was a hit at our house, even with those who do not like hot dogs.  To save extra time, I sauteed the celery and onions together.  This is a keeper recipe!REVVery good.  We put the left overs in the frige and snacked on them for a couple of days.  REVThis was pretty good, i didnt put celery into it though, i dont eat just hot dogs, dont like em, but i do like corn dogs and these were pretty close!REVA recipe must be good if you forget an ingredient and the family still likes it!  I forgot the cheese but hubby and I still enjoyed this very much.  I also used yellow onions instead of green onions.  5 stars for originality!REVI didn''t have any sage in the house so I didn''t put it in and this was still good.  I saw this recipe on another website and some people complained it was a little dry. One of the reviewers said they''d added a can of creamed corn and it made it much more moist.  I might try that next time, but we didn''t really have issues with the texture.REVGreat recipe!!!  I used fresh sage, but other than that followed it exactly.  I will definitely be making it again. I just had to put ketchup on top and it was a nice touch.REVWas very nice, i made it today and my bf and me liked it very much. I love corndogs but as they usually have to be fried and i try to not do it, when i found this recipe was very glad that was baked instead. I made some variations though, I used polenta meal with baking powder and allpurpouse flour, instead of the cornbread mix. It''s already in my favorites and i will make it more, but i guess will use something else like mushrooms instead of celery .Tnx 4 sharingREVI halved the recipe and used a bit more cheese than indicated but I felt that it needed something extra added to add more flavormaybe sliced tomatoes on top of the casserole.REVWow, this was really good!  We cut back on the sage a little and really piled on the cheese  the kids added some mustard at the table and they''re already asking when we can have it again.  REVWe didn''t think this tasted like ''corn dogs'' but it wasn''t in anyway a disagreeable flavor!  I''m wondering what I did wrong...Mine didn''t look like the picture?
Possibly too much cheese...I think I should try the recipe again!  I served ours with a mustard sauce...mustard, mayo and crushed red chili flakes combinedREVI slightly messed up the recipe by combining everything together instead of splitting the hot dog mix.  It was really good and my husband loved it.  We used turkey hot dogs, which were great.  One thing I might try next time is using a 2qt dish instead so it is a little thicker.REVThis recipe was good, served it with ketchup. I too felt it was dry without ketchup. It seemed like maybe it was missing something, but was a very good quick recipe. Would consider making again if I was in a time crunch with few ingredients on hand. REVThis recipe is really good and the sage tastes wonderful in it. It really goes great with the cornbread. I took this to a potluck and everyone loved it. I brought mustard but wasn''t really crazy about the taste of the mustard on this. I think that it was very good just by itself. The next time I will also use smoked sausage or little smokies. Thank you, MG.REVThis casserole tasted just like corndogs without the sticks! I would reccomend eating this topped with your favorite corndog condiments. Ketchup and mustard mixed is what topped mine. I thought that it was alittle dry without the toppings. I think next time I''ll try some extra onions, celery and cheese in the batter. Still a great tasting casserole for corndog lovers!REVKid pleaser!! I too enjoyed this. My stepdaughter wanted this for her birthday dinner and said that this birthday was better than last year''s Chuck E. Cheese birthday because they didn''t have hot dogs.REVThis tasted pretty good, but it was very crumbly and did not hold together well. I will make it again, but may use an extra egg.REVMy kids are corn dog lovers, so this was a huge hit with them.  They made sure I have this recipe saved and printed out so that I can make it again and again.REVI liked it a lot. I kept telling the kids it''s a kid pleaser, but they still didn''t take to it. The two year old ate two servings, however. I had to leave out the onion and celery because the kids don''t like busy food. ok, I snuck in some dried, minced onion shh. It was a little dry that way, so when I make it again and I will I may add more milk or egg.');

I can''t imagine how even more delicious it is with the marinade at 24 hours.  The cucumber sauce was also one of the best we have ever had.  I didn''t have mint, and substituted tarragon in it''s place.  It worked perfectly.REVVery easy and very good!!I used the more pedestrian versions of some of the ingredients and it still came out great.REVGreat chicken!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  The flavors of the marinade were perfect.  I served this with some rice and a greek salad.  I will make this often!REVDelicious! I made the chicken to the recipe, cutting each breast into about 3 smaller pieces. I only marinated for 3 or so hours but the flavour was still excellent. The cucumber sauce we know it as tzatziki was great, although I couldnt get hold of any mint, fresh or dried, so left it out. I''ve just returned from a holiday in Greece so this was a fantastic meal for us to relive the wonderful food there! I will definitely be making again, thanks for sharing.REVWonderful!  I really loved the cucumber sauce.  It was quick and easy and really made the dish.  Even my picky eater said These are good!.  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for a great dish.REV6 points per servingREVMade this very easy and very nice recipe with strips of chicken breast and put them in a pita pocket with some lettuce, onion, and sliced tomatoes gyros style with tzatziki sauce. This is a nice recipe for the tzatziki, using fresh mint. I didn''t have time to marinate the chicken or fire up the gril, but the flavors came through just fine because I pan fried the chicken and the marinade together in a skillet on medium heat. As the chicken cooked, the marinade reduced and evaporated...then the chicken quickly browned beautifully, with a coating of those concentrated flavors.');

Kids enjoyed.REVThe key for success is to thoroughly dry the hot dogs and then dust them with flour so that the batter will adhere easily. Also, BYOC Be Your Own Chef by trying to add other ingredients to the batter..ie cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, dry mustard or even sugar or a few.REVTasty and easy to make what more could a busy mom ask for?!REVWhat a treat, especially with cheesefilled hot dogs. I picked up a couple tips from other reicpes on this site 1 Pat the dogs dry with a paper towel before dipping, and 2 Put the batter in a tall glass to dip. We put them on wooden skewers for frying, and also put a bit of hot pepper in the batter for more flavor. Quick and easy, and practically no dishes to wash!REVThis turned out pretty good!  We made them without sticks, which turned out just as easy to do.  Our oil had gotten hotter than 375, so they only took about 2 minutes to cook. We had leftover batter, which we dropped into the oil to fry too, and they turned out as delicious little pastries!REVEmbarrassingly, I''d never had corn dogs until these!! But they turned out great! Super easy to make and delicious. I now get why everyone loves corn dogs!REVThis was an easy recipe to make, I needed to add about an extra tablespoon of milk and dusting the hotdogs with flour helps keep the batter on the dogs.REVWhat I could salvage was good. The batter doesn''t stick to the hot dog and the dog sticks in the deep fryer when you try to take it out.REVI added 1 t dry mustard, paprika, a dash of cayenne and also used 12 polenta and 12 corn ''flour'' for the cornmeal component.

It is by far the best onion soup you will ever eat. Thank You Famous Barr. It freezes well.REVThis was excellent soup. Totally forgot to take a pic of it though. But I will next time I have it. I used sweet vidalia onions. I also had put in about 2 Tbs. of Worchestire sauce instead of Kitchen Bouquet and did not put any salt in it.  I did use the wine but I think I would like to try sherry the next time. I find it adds a little different taste. The house smells so good when this is simmering. I chose to go with gruyere cheese. Personally I find this is the perfect cheese for this soup. Delicious flavor of sweet onions and a fantastic broth. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe Bill it was much appreciated.REVAwesome soup!!! I think it rivals Panera Bread''s French Onion Soup. This will be the ONLY French Onion Soup recipe that I use for now on.Thank you very much for posting.REVI have tried different recipes and this one is hands down the BEST one!  I didn''t let it sit overnight and was still great.  The only change I made was cutting the recipe in half and I wish I didn''t because it would have been great to freeze the leftovers.  I used the Gruyere cheese as recommended.  Thanks for a great recipe!REVThis recipe is the bomb!! Love it Love it... big fan of french onion soup and cooking the onions for a long time makes such a difference. Thank you for a great recipeREVAbsolute delicious! Even my four year old loves it! I play with different cheeses but the soup is always perfect! Thanks!REVFabulous!  I didn''t have broth so I used Better Than Boullion paste and warm water to make my broth, and it had an extremely beefy flavor.  Quartered the recipe for two of us, and there was very little left over...Also, I used Vidalia onions as that is what I had.  My husband asked me to make it again some night this week.  I guess I''ll have to make a huge batch and freeze it.REVI''ve been using Food.com for years and this is my first review.  This soup was AMAZING!!!  I have made it twice this week.  All of my boys gobbled it up ages 7 and under and my husband just loved it.  I''ve had wonderful french onion soup before and I was worried that I could never find a comparable recipewell I just did, and this one is even better.  REVI''m sorry, I hate giving bad reviews.  I had such high hopes for this soup but it turned out terribly.  Perhaps I just like a more brothy French Onion Soup or maybe it was a weird reaction with my cast iron dutch oven.  It was very thick and the flour was not a good addition.  The paprika was overpowering which is saying something when it''s competing with onions and tasted off.  My 4 year old loved it and had seconds which is why I gave it two stars but sadly DH and I did not like it at all.  At any rate, give it a whirl, it''s worked for more people than not.REVFantastic! The best French Onion soup I have ever made.  It was thick, rich, beautiful colour and the flavour was outstanding.  I have deleted all other recipes  saved to try............this is the ONLY one I will ever make from now on.I would not change a thing, why mess with perfection.Thank you so much my Husbandcould not stop raving.  I can''t wait to make this for company.REVI made this a couple of years ago and never rated it  shame on me! This a great soup.  I get cravings for it now and just have to make it.  I have never had the Famous Barr''s French Onion Soup  but I always ate Houlihans  and this is hands down better.  I made this as directed and only made one addition of about 12 Tbsp Worcheswtershire sauce  this soup ROCKS!REVFantastic, since we are vegetarians I used vegetable stock, did everything else the same, for sure the best french onion soup recipe out there, better than any restaurant I''ve ever had it in before becoming a vegetarian and yes, it does freeze well too... YUMMY, I''ve got another batch on the stove right now as I type this.REVThis soup is awesome. It takes a little time to make but well worth the effort. My kids even love it and that says a lot.  Thank you for sharing the recipe. Suggestion, wear your kids swim goggles, or the last time I made this I wore my daughter''s chemistry goggles. It helps when slicing your onions in the food processor. PREVWow, this is some rich french onion soup!  I could only eat a little at a time, but the flavor was really great.  I think next time I will thicken it less as it almost seemed like gravy.  Very good!  Thanks for posting.REVOh I DO love this! I started with sweet onions, half spanish sweets and half vidalias. I had no white wine so I used a couple of splashes of shiraz otherwise I followed the recipe....except I added thyme and did not bother to thicken it I don''t think it needed it!. My very discriminating onion soup loving son now worships me for this evening anyway. Thank you so much for yet another wonderful recipe!REVThis was voted best soup at the soup potluck dinner I went to last night in St Louis!. I love making the large batch this recipe calls for, I freeze it and eat it all winter. I don''t like lots of salt in my soup, so I make it with 32 oz of low sodium beef broth and add water for the remaining liquid. I also add 1.5 lbs of beef, cubed, and this makes up for diluting the broth. Somehow the sweetness of the soup omits the need for more salt. One thing I''ve noticed is that you really must scrape the bottom of the pot throughout the cooking process! Thank you for posting this wonderful soup.REVThis is wonderful.  We used vegetarian broth Cambell''s.  Up to now, all French Onion soup since we became veggies has been disappointing.  This one is thick, rich, and delicious.  Perfect! Perfect!REVLast reviewer was right! I had high expectations for this soup, and there was something missing. I added a splash of worcestershire sauce and BLISS! Definitely have this in the store cupboard ready incase you feel the same. I would also chop the bread in chunks instead of a slice, as it is hard to chop inside the soup. But overall, a lovely experience making this soup, and eating it  xxREVI grew up in St. Louis and know this soup well but my first time eating it was not easy.  I had a mental picture of a big smelly onion. How could this be called  soup. Ahh but  when it was served the aroma was so good, it was only exceded by it''s taste.  That was 45 yrs ago. thanks for the recipe and memoriesREVHigh praise from 8 of my Valentine''s Day Dinner guests who all wanted the recipe!  I stored it overnight in the crock pot that I used to simmer it for 2 extra hours the day that I served it.  To avoid having to handle oven hot servings, I took the advice of another reviewer and broiled gruyere cheese onto toasted french bread. Then I put the bread on top of each half filled bowl and spooned hot soup on top until each bowl was full. So easy and so pretty for a formal dinner.  Simply fabulous without wine or coloring!REVNext time, I plan on making this in the crock pot or leave the house for a few hours so it can simmer in peace. Since I started making this, I have been munching on it and it''s a wonder there''s any left. The longer you can stand to let it simmer it smells delicious while cooking the more the flavours come out. I halved the recipe as I''m the only one in a twoperson household who eats onions  plus, I had just about 2.5 lbs, exactly, to use up. Another recipe I saw called for brown sugar to carmelize the onions. I gave that a shot and added about 34 tsp. of dark brown sugar. I didn''t notice a difference in the taste. I used 4 bullion cubes in about 3.5 cups of water. When I was making the flour thickening, I added more flour than I intended and thinned it out with more broth until I got it to a consistency I liked. I didn''t bother with the caramel colouring as I didn''t have it on hand or thought the soup needed it. I did have to substitute provolone cheese for the gruyere, but the soup is fantastic without it too. Thanks for sharing a lipsmackingly delicious recipe. Will most definitely be making this again.REVGreat soup flavor and aroma while cooking!  We loved this served the day it cooked, and leftover.  I used a prepared low sodium, nomsg commercial beef broth which had a rich enough color that I did not need to use caramel coloring.  However, the flavor of the broth was strong prefer the onion flavor to be the strongest! and next time I will use a homemade broth.  The recipe refered to onions unpeeled.  I didn''t know if this meant to leave the skins on, but I did peel the onion skins off before slicing.  Will make this againthanks for sharing a foolproof fantastic recipe.REVGreat recipe!  After the prep, I stuck it in the crock pot to simmer for a few hours.  The smell was wonderful.  I''ve made other onion soups, but this was the best, and hubby loved it too.  I didn''t have any white wine or caramel coloring, but it was excellent without them.  Served with a baguette that I broiled swiss cheese on.  Great leftover, and I even froze a small amount for lunch one day.  Thanks!REVI didn''t use the wine or the caramel coloring. 
I also added garlic. It was wonderful. 
My husband said it''s the best French onion soup he''s ever had. I doubled the recipe and it froze like a dream! Absolutely will make this again!REVThis french onion soup is very very good!  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton of soup!  I did not use the caramel coloring or kitchen bouquet and it it still came out quite dark and nice.  I also served with sliced mozzarella and sliced french baguette bread per preference.  The smell of the sauteed onions in butter was awesome! This was SO easy to make!  I would definitely recommend!  Thanks for posting Bill!REVFantastic recipe.  I made it without the KB or caramel coloring as well and it was lovely.  Served it with Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, yum.  Thanks for posting Bill.REVDelicious!I used canola oil instead of butter and chicken powder dissolved in water, instead of the beef broth. I also left out the caramel coloring.REVI can''t say it much better than the 84 reviewers before me except that it was ''OUT OF THIS WORLD'' good!!

Thanks for sharing a keeper of a recipe!REVYum! Really enjoyed this! Used recipe 438574 and only 3 32oz. cartons of organic beef broth equivalent of 6 cans.  From other reviews I thought this might be a problem but it wasn''t overly thick. Froze the remainder in individual servings, along with individual croutons toasted French bread topped with Swiss cheese and broiled in a separate bag for a quick meal. Thanks for sharing the recipe!REVYears ago, I was given this recipe and stored it securely with other cherished recipes.  Recently, I searched thoroughly and could not find it.  One night, it occurred to me...find it on the internet.  Over the years, I''ve tried other French Onion Soups at various cafes and restaurants.  What I found was that there is NO comparison.  This is, by far, the BEST THERE IS.  The rich, thick consistency allows the baguette to float beautifully atop the soup.  Also, I used gruyere and found it added more than the swiss.REVAbsolutely the best!REVMade this exactly as directed. Believe it or not the 4 of us ate it until gone! I served as an appetizer but I had to put the actual dinner I made away to eat another day because we were too full from eating the soup!REVThis soup is excellent!!!! Bill, just wanted you to know I''ll be blaming you for the 500 lbs. I''ll be putting on eating this can''t control myself LOL!! Thanks again.REVThis soup was a big hit and is so hip and thrifty.  We used red wine instead of white, and because we used a homemade beef broth, we needed to add a lot more salt to give it the oomph.  The long simmering of the onions is key.  And as the soup mellows into itself throughout the days, it just keeps getting better and better.REVThis is the best French Onion soup I have ever made or eatten any where. Once you have tasted it you have to have more. So make a BIG pot.REVI believe that this recipe was created for Famous Barr by Chef Larry Ziegler. Correct me if I''m wrong. I love this soup. I used to work for the restaurant and enjoyed it many times.REVA family friend made this soup and brought it to a potluck.  I had never had French Onion soup before and wasn''t very willing to try it at first.  I was finally convinced to try a small dish and OMG I fell in love with french onion soup.  I purchased a can of Campbell''s French Onion soup but it doesn''t even begin to come close to how good this soup tastes.  I am glad that I found the recipe and now make it myself.  It''s really not that hard at all to make.  I have a cuisnart food processor that I used for the onions  that really is the worst part of making the soup the onions.  I just made another batch today...sure it won''t last long REVI followed this to the T. While I thought it to be OK, to me it039s not worth all the work. I can get just as good or what I consider better with a lot less work.REVHate to disappoint everyone, but this is not the original Famous Barr039s French Onion Soup Recipe. Living very close to St. Louis, I had a friend who worked downtown making the French Onion Soup.  It was a 2 day process to make, but well worth the time it took. I have the original recipe but promised my friend I would never give it out.REVnot a good recipe.....no butter...just sweat onions....add burgundy wine and fresh garlic cook untill wine gone....add BEEF stock...simmer and add sherry and brandy ....simmer and taste seasonREVThank you, I use to to eat at Famous Barr every time we visited my aunt in St. Louis. In 1984 I moved to St.Louis from Calif. and the first place I went was Famous Barr and left there with a job.I have tried for to many years to get this recipe with much failure. I wont try any one else039s no one can compare and I only got disappointed so I stopped. I have waited 32 years for this I have Cancer and so will cook this ASAP again thank you if you stay with recipe dont change a thing you will never try another.REVMy memory of FamousBarr Onion Soup is wonderful  it was always good. I have found, however, that using only beef broth or stock can make the soup a little bitter. I make onion soup following an America''s Test Kitchen which calls for only chicken broth. It is an extremely good soup!!REVI really liked this! I made enough to freeze, and used as a base for veg beef soup. It''s a keeper, thanks!REVI finally made the time to make this afternoon. THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT! The family was impressed and our bellies happy. We will be making this again!REVI am a fan of French Onion Soup and have wanted to make it at home for quite a while. I made this with a few tweaks and think it excellent. I cut Paprika in half based on a review I read here, figuring I could add more during simmer if my taste buds suggested it needed more. Also, based on comments here, I cut the flour to 12 c. It is still just a bit thick for my liking, especially after soaking into the baguette. But thinning is pretty easy using that magic ingredient. During simmer tasting, I felt something was lacking. It was a bit bland. After reading other recipes to see what it might need, I settled on adding Worcestershire sauce and Thyme. I added 3 generous pinches of Thyme and started adding dashes of Worcestershire, probably about 15 dashes total, and they did the trick. Don''t know if the Thyme did anything, but the Worcestershire did. I know some don''t like it when you review a recipe you have tweaked. But hey, who doesn''t take a recipe and make it their own by from time to time. I give it 4 stars as written, 5 as it turned out.REVI used about 5 cups of browned onions to make my own versions. Used beef Better Than Bouillon concentrate to make my broth love this stuff and kept adding more of it till I had a salty, flavorful stock base. Did make a small batch of roux and added the broth to that, then stirred it back into the rest of the broth. A little wine was a nice touch. Good recipe to follow, and a good one to use as a base to add your own preferred seasonings and favorite products.REVI recently lost my Momma. I have some very precious memories of feeling like we had won the lottery, simply because we ate french onion soup at Famous Bar. The last time will never forgeten, we went to Famous Bar far a facial and french onion soup and even the exact makeup that was used during the facial. Thank you Momma for creating such an amazing forever memory! The kind of memory that absolutely no one other than the 2 of us can understand. I luv and miss ya like crazy! THANK YOU FAMOUS BAR!!!!!!!REVIf you are trying to eat healthy, soup has got its neutrality to eat healthy. Ready to cook soupREVThe unpeeled onions refer to the total weight prior to peeling. 2 12 lbs after peeling will be close to 2 lbs.REVI grew up in the St Louis area and ate this soup at Famous Barr dozens of times. For years they had the recipe printed on a table tent on every table. Refrigerating overnight is absolutely crucial. Served it one time the same day and the paprika was way too strong. The same batch the next day was sublime. I use Better than Bouillon or Johnny''s French onion soup concentrate rather than canned broth. Either makes it much better. I melted the cheese on the bread under the broiler and then add to the soup. Much easier to handle.REVI downloaded this recipe in 2011, but never made it until today. Silly me, it was delicious! I only had a 3lb. bag of onions on hand, so I used that and 5 cans of beef broth. Also added Better than Bouillion with the flourbroth mixture. It''s just me and my husband, so I will freeze the remaining for another meal. Also, I thought it odd to simmer for 2 hours after adding the broth, but it really is one of the most important steps! If you follow the recipe EXACTLY, it won''t disappoint!REVThis is the BEST French Onion Soup recipe!!!!!! The house reeks when you first start but the end result is well worth it!!!  Thank you so very much!!!!!REVAmazing! I am a serious soup lover and French onion is my absolute favorite. This recipe made enough for my husband and I to enjoy with leftover and wound up with enough to send half to our neighbors, whose daughter had just graduated high school. I sent the soup, slices of Swiss and smoked provolone slices, a simple tossed salad and a loaf of french bread. If not for the surplus, I would have sent only a handmade card with cash they are incredible neighbors. Variation I had no white wine drank it all it039s summer! so, I used the same measurement of vegetable stock with about five dashes of white wine vinegar as a substitution. It started to get a little thick for my taste so, I added an extra cup of beef stock after the final simmering stage, turned the heat off and let sit for 30 mins. The flavor and consistency was perfect at this point. I have had soup of the same, thicker consistency that sticking to the exact recipe yields and it was great but, not quotbullseye!quot. If I have my perfect French onion, it is a little soupier that and necessity substituting veggie stock white wine vinegar is the only reason I deviated from the recipe. I will be making this every week for lunches. I have been paying 4 bucks a bowl. I can make a whole stock pot full for that and change. Plus, I found it to be delicious enough to include in a food gift. Thank you so much for sharing. The long cook time is so worth the flavor payoff.REVWow! This soup is so amazing it doesn''t even need cheese! My husband and I were licking our  bowls! I followed the recipe but did not include the caramel color or kitchen bouquet. I made a half recipe for the two of us but next time I''ll make a full recipe and freeze the rest... if it makes it that long! Thanks for the recipe.REVI finally got around to making this yesterday, in spite of the fact that I grew up eating FamousBarr039s soups.  This is delicious, and very close to the original.  I did not thicken and glad I didn039t, this soup was perfect without it.  To add body without thickening with flour which leaves a goopy, pasty consistency....use just 23 short pulses with an immersion blender.  This will still leave chunks of onion, but will puree just slightly and break up the longer strings of onion.  You will end up with a silky textured, rich but still thin broth.  Add the bread and cheese, and the soup will have plenty of body.  ltbrgtI also did not feel the need to add Kitchen Bouquet. ltbrgtNext time I will reduce the paprika just slightly, for good balance with the onions.  Will definitely make this again and again.REVI followed the recipe as is only making a half batch and added a T of brown sugar to the onions after they cooked for a while in lieu of caramel coloring. We liked the thicker consistency and flavors but either the pepper or paprika made it way too spicy. Next time I will add less of both or maybe no pepper and less paprika to see how that works. Great recipe though.REVThis is so yummy.  I made this last night and the little girl we had staying with us informed me that she doesn''t like onions.  I told her to just try it when its done and see.  Well she was licking her bowl clean AND asking for seconds!!!  This does take some time, so plan ahead, but the results are fantastic.  We loved it.  I didn''t use shredded swiss, I just laid a slice across the bowl and it formed a nice crust on top.  Thank you so much for this restaraunt quality soup.REVI have been making this soup for over 20 years and have never found another recipe that even comes close.  It is time consuming but the results are amazing.  The only thing that I do differently is, instead of mixing the flour with a can of broth, I add the flour to the paprika, salt and papper and make a roux by adding the mix to the tenderized onions.  You need to stir constantly because you don''t want the mixture to scorch or brown, but you do want to cook it long enough to get the flour taste to disappear.  The roux takes about 1020 minutes of stirring to get all the flour incorporated with the onion liquid.  After the roux is ready, slowly start adding your liquid, stirring all the time.  The result is a smooth, rich texture.  No lumps and no flour taste.  If it is too thick for your liking, add another can of broth.brbrIf you''re really ambitious...make your own stock!  You will notice the difference.  No can taste, more flavor and healthier too!  Enjoy!REVI made this exactly as written it really irks me when prople rate a recipe that they have not made to the letter. As an onion gravy, I would rate this three stars. As a soup, I can''t rate it, as to us, this was not a soup. I read ALL the reviews so I made the full amount so we would have plenty for the freezer. I guess we just like our onion soup brothy and not as sweet must have been the long cooking that removed the oniony taste. I guess we fall in the minority here.REVThis French Onion Soup is the best I''ve tried.  Very good and it''s easy also. I''ve made this at least 5 times and my family goes crazy over it.  Great soup!!!!!REVAs I was cooking this, I wasn''t so sure of how it would turn out.  It really coated the entire house with the smell of the soup.  I made it to freeze and was glad I did.  Had I eaten it that same day, I may not have liked it since I was kind of done with the smell.  However, after reheating and adding a toasted piece of french bread with shredded gruyere melted in the oven, it was fantastic. I would not recommend making this for a dinner party and serving the same day.  The smell really was too much and no amount of air freshener helped.  Airing out the house with open windows was the only solution.  Still, overall, I am thrilled with this recipe!  And, it freezes very well.REVI am told that I am excellent at making soups and so this recipe, with these reviews surprised me.  I think the overall flavor is great but it is WAY to rich to call a soup.  It seemed just short of a port gravy, of course minus the red wine.  I really wanted to like this soup but it was SO rich too rich to call a soup.  I did follow the recipe to a tee so I''m not sure why the rave reviews.REVPerfect.REVLoved it easy to make and the taste was awesomeREVVery good soup, even using Better than Bouillon Not Beef vegetarian.  A definite keeper!REVCame home from a weekend away, after 6 hours in the car, thinking what could I make for dinner?  Something easy and good, but somewhat light.  I thought of this soup and starting making it at 630, then I saw the directions say that it takes over 4 hours to prepare.  I cut that down to a little over an hour.  I have an induction cook top and got the onions going at a higher temp, while stirring constantly.  I added a little brown sugar to sweeten them, they caramelized nicely, then I added the salt, pepper and paprika along with the flour  cooked while stirring for a bit, then added the broth and wine.  Simmer for 30 min.  Toasted some french bread in the broiler with olive oil and a little garlic.  Served with mozzarella cheese  parmesan cheese over the toasted bread  broiled.  Delicious!REVExtremely delicious!  I love Famous Barr''s French Onlon Soup and then they stopped making it.  I am happy this recipe came along.REVIMHO, this is an ok soup gravy, but not a true French Onion soup, hense the 2 stars. I followed the ingredient list as written, but altered the cooking technique just a little. First, I exactly halved ALL of the ingredients in case I didn''t like it and secondly, I took a tip from another reviewer and mixed the flour, paprika,pepper and salt together and put that in with the onions after their cooking time and made a roux and then added the broth. I think the total cooking time for the onions, 3 12 hours, is way too long, they were almost mush, and most of them disappeared into the liquid. I also thought that the paprika overpowered the onions, and gave the soup an off taste and an odd caramel color, which is why I added enough Kitchen Bouquet to try and offset that. It was more like an onion gravy than a soup. I thank you for posting, but I''ll stick to my tried and true recipe.REVThis is a good, tasty soup  but be advised  it is not classic French Onion Soup see Julia Child. I had never been to Barrs, so have no frame of reference. It''s the paprika that makes it so different. Good, but different.REVI can not believe that I have not rated this recipe. Being a STL girl since birth this recipe brings sweet memories, and that is all that is left now since FamousBarr is now just a memory. So I am very glad that you posted this here, Bill. It is as close as I can come to the soup I remember having as a young girl with my Grandmother when we would go downtown. Thanks for posting it here so it can live on.REVI made this delicious soup using my home made veal and beef short rib stock.  I carmalized the onions separately, since I was finishing my stock at the same time.  It is fantastic!  It reminded me of something I had in the south of France  great memories along lamb and chateaudupape.REVThis is by far the BEST French onion soup you will EVER eat!  Worth every minute of cooking time!  Who ever gave this a bad review about 20 reviews from the top... unfortunately doesn039t know herhis way around the kitchen!  This soup is so easy and SO delicious!REVVery enjoyable.  I made the recipe as called for without the addition for caramel coloring.  It made so much that I immediately froze half of the soup.  In the future, I think I will half the recipe.  That will still allow me to freeze a quart and eat the other half right away.  I will also splurge on the gruyere next time as I think the flavor makes a BIG difference  swiss doesn''t really come close.REVWe didnt care for this that much, it seemed like it was missing something.REVThis was really good and my husband loved it.  Made recipe as stated except omitted wine.  Next time will add more onions than called for.REVEveryone we make this for, raves about it.REVGood, but it was still missing something I couldn''t put my finger on.  I added more salt  pepper after cooking, then added about 1 TBS of Worcestershire sauce and 14 grated Parmesan.  Helped.  Next time, I''ll use less paprika and a sharper, maybe caveaged Gruyere to add a little sumthinsumthin. Thanks for a good start!REVVery reminiscent of a recent trip to Paris.... This soup is delicious  great depth of flavour.  I also added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce.REVOh, so wonderful! I skipped caramel coloring. I made six gallons of the stuff for an event  It doubles sextuples! well and reheats nicely after being frozen. Yum.REVI''ll add my 5 star rating to the rest. Very thick and creamy. Excellent.REVThis soup was delicious.  I used vidalia onions, so it was probably sweeter than if I had used plain yellow ones.  I melted provolone cheese on the top, which balanced the sweetness, and it was excellent.  After reading the reviews, I decided to make the whole recipe, and I''m so glad I did.  This soup is just wonderful and I''m glad I had enough left over to freeze and send home with a guest. Thank you for this recipe!REVeasy to make and delilcious to eat!Zolad2aol.comREVThis was very rich, and wonderful. I love French Onion Soup, but sometimes onions in the quantity upset my stomach.  This version did not, and I attribute it to cooking the onions slowly for a long time. Because I did not read the recipe far enough in advance, I was only able to cook them for an hour before adding the other ingredients, and I did not refrigerate overnight.  Also, I only had hot paprika on hand, so I only used half. It actually gave it a nice bite. Definite keeper!REVI must have had some powerful onions because everyone in the house was crying when I started making it.  However, everyone proclaimed it well worth it after it was finished.  It was fabulous!  I made it exactly according to the directions except we didnt refrigerate it overnight.  I will make this again and again, and I am sure my family will insist that I do so!  Thanks!REVI''ve just got to say THANKS. The first time I ever had French onion soup was when my aunt took me to a Famous Barr store in Alton, IL just across the river from STL. I never dreamed I would find the recipe. Thanks so much for posting!!!!REVApparently I was so overwhelmed with this recipe that I forgot to review it....!!!

THis is absolutely FANTASTIC, and most likely the ONLY recipe I''ll use for French Onion Soup in future.

One thing I took away from this recipe is that the method for carmelizing the onions was absolutely fantastic. Even if I didn''t LOVE the soup, I would certainly keep this recipe for cooked onions!
...Thanks, Bro!  REVHaving gone to graduate school in St. Louis go Cardinals!!!, I had to try this one.  It is so good and we had alot left over.  Toasted french bread with swiss cheese melted on it tops it off great.  Thanks Brother!!REVThanks you for this recipe, as a teenager I used to always enjoy a bowl of this famous soup at Famous Barr in Springfield, IL, I made a soup but this is awesome and brings back so many memories.. thanks again.REVI looked this up as soon as I found Recipe Zaar because I decided that this site was only as good as the great recipes I could find.  This is one of the best soups in the world can you tell I grew up on it?.  The best part of it is the Gruyere cheese.  There''s just something different about it from plain old Swiss!  Thanks for bringing back wonderful soup memories!REVWay back my mother somehow got the recipe and I''ve been enjoying it for years and years. Glad to see it posted as it is too good not to share. The gruyere cheese is the best on this!! Thank you for submitting this.REVOh gosh. This soup was to die for! I''ve been wanting to make French onion soup for quite some time and this definitely didn''t disappoint! This was really simple to make and while it does take a while, it''s definitely worth it! The only thing I really did differently was change the amount of some things a bit less butter and I added some minced garlic when the onions were nearly finished. I can''t wait to make this again when I''m brave enough to slice all those onions again! Thank you!REVMy parents are from the St. Louis area and this is the French Onion Soup that my mom makes. We always had this as part of our Christmas Dinner. This is a great recipe!REVAll I can say is YUM!!  I made the whole recipe, the family and sisinlaw ate some for lunch and I froze the rest. It is great for lunches that you can heat up. I take bread and cheese on the side to stick in after I microwave it!!  Thanks Bill.REVI have never heard of Famous Barr''s but This is awesome soup, I halved the recipe, and I wish I didnt, I should have made the whole thing and frozen half.  I think the thing that makes this recipe work is cooking the onions for an hour and a half, the smell in my kitchen !!!!!! excellent recipe Bill,and easy to make. thanksREVThis was fabulous! I had to improvise a bit as I did not have canned broth in the house. I used Bovril beef bouillon concentrate and I did not have wine available. I had unexpected company show up just before dinner so I had to add a pkt of onion soup to stretch it out further. It still tasted great even after that. Next time I want to make it to the letter. I am sure it will be even better! Thank you for posting. 
Update.... I have made this a few more times      to the letter and with substitutions... a very forgiving recipe we have loved it every time, thank you againREVThe French Onion soup recipe is one of the most popular dish served at the Famous Barr also part of the May Dept store group restaurants found in St.Louis.   Based on my travels to the various countries including Europe, Asia and US, this version of French Onion soup is one of the best I''ve had. My husband who is from London just loves this recipe.

It is robust and hearty in beef and onion flavour and quite thick so you can enjoy this as a meal in itself you might say it''s great comfort food.  Be sure to use the broiler until the cheese bubbles and turns golden brown over the French bread. Tip Try to use the fresh French bread which is a bit chewy in texture.    

Bon Appetit.REVAbsolutely Delightful Recipe! Rich and Flavorful!REVAren''t there 6 or seven stars to choose from.  WOW!  I was so excited to see this recipe.  I absolutely loved this soup when my husband and I would go to Famous Barr 30 years, when he was in the seminary at Concordia St. Louis.  I have made it through the years, because an aunt had sent me the recipe from her local Springfield, IL newspaper about 20 years.  Once I lost it, but a friend retrieved it for me from the time she had asked me for it.  What I love about your site is the instant way to double or triple or whatever the recipe!  I make this recipe a number of times each year, but I always make it for a big Christmas Party we have.  Everyone loves it and looks forward to it each year!  Thanks so much!  I always serve it with homemade bread and a Ceasar Salad.  I look forward to your newsletters.REVIt is the most delicious onion soup I have even eaten, and when I lived in St. Louis I would eat it at least twice a week, especially on Friday.REVWish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Live on the East Coast now and can''t find a restaurant that can compare to this.  I remember going to St.Louis for Weekends with my parents.  Famous Bar For lunch was a definite.  Always ordered the French Onion Soup.  We would stay at the Mayfair Hotel and always had the Mayfair Salad with dinner. I know have the recipe for Mayfair Dressing.  This just completes it for me.REVI finally got around to making this and kick myself for not doing so sooner.  This is just a fabulous French Onion soup.  The only drawback is processing the onions.  Believe it or not, I put on swim goggles processing them!!!  Maybe I just had extra potent onions???  But once that was done the rest was just a matter of time and the results were outstanding.  I have several frozen lumps of French Onion soup to enjoy for some time to come  like tonight.  Thank you for posting this one Bill.  I usually don''t say I''ll do this one again but. . . . I''ll do this one again.REVI had the time so cooked the onions for about three hours before adding broth.  Very nice flavor and appearance.  Will make this my new standard recipe.  Thank you!REVPerfect 
One of the best I have had,  A nice stock recipe 80434 works well with this soup.  A long cooking time but not a lot of work to make   
Better then many restaurants 
Have used vidalia onions and put in two large onions per person I am making it for  also used pre sliced baugette and dried the bread in the oven before using in the soupREVOh WOW.  I cannot get my nose or spoon out of the soup pot!  I had heard of this soup from a St. Louis native, and finally got a chance to make it today.  I agree completely with the other reviews about this being the best French Onion soup I''ve ever tasted. The French couldn''t do it any better.  I didn''t add any extra salt to this since I used salted butter the flavor is outstanding.  A Hands Down favorite!REVUsed to eat this at Famous as a kid.  Loved it but the old lady watresses would only serve kids if they were with an adult.  I found out over the years alot of us as kids couldn''t get served at Famous.REVThanks to my brother for passing this recipe along to me.  I made it orginally for my son, but now make it for ME!  To save calories I don''t even add the cheese, and it''s still great.  Very warm and smooth.  Sweet onions have been on sale, and when they are, the recipe comes out.  Freezes great for lunches.REVA really good soup.  French onion is my husband''s favorite, and he loved the recipe.  I omitted the bay leaf, caramel color, and the white wine because I did not have them on hand.  I used a homemade French baguette sliced and dried out in at 250 degrees in the oven for about 15 minutes.  I then added monzarella cheese on top and toasted until the cheese was bubbly and slightly browned.  I then added the bread to the bowls of hot soup.  I do not own any oven crocks that I could have broiled the bread and cheese in, but making the cheese toast separately worked really well for me.  I also used the Swanson''s broth.  With the Swanson''s Broth the color was right on, so I am not sure if the caramel color is really even necessary.Thanks for a great recipe.REVMy mother and I would shop at Famous when I was young, and no trip was complete without having lunch, talk about a memory in a bowl!REVThis is a fabulous recipe!   I didn''t have caramel color, but it really was a rich color on its own.  I did add about 12 tsp of nutmeg to it which I have used from other recipes.   I also deleted the salt, as I found there to be enough of a salty taste on its own just right!
A rich and wonderful soup that makes my mouth water at the thought of it!REVThis was great..made it for a super bowl party and most thought it was super..sorry no pun..just make sure you make enough for all to have seconds..ThanksREVDelicious soup, simple to make, although the onions take ages,it is really worth it to give depth to the flavour of the soup. My children had been in the states this summer and raved about the onion soup they tried out there saying it was better than their Grans! When they tried this one they said it was just as good as the one in USA. Thanks for posting.REVI have this same exact recipe and make it when I long for the ''goodoledays'' when I lived in St. Louis and ate at the Famous Barr restaurant.  I had a hard time ordering anything else but this soup.  It''s a meal in itself.  The recipe is very very close to the real thing!  Rich, smooth, oniony, and the best part, the slice of crusty bread on top covered with cheese that strings from the bowl to your mouth! A MUST try for any onion soup lovers!  For those watching their salt....use the lowsodium beef broth like I do. REVPERFECT!!! My family loved this soup. I liked the thicker consistency this soup has. This is my onion soup from now on, thanks brother William!!!REVI love this soup!  Simple to make, very tasety and I always have everything I need in my kithchen to make it.  When I don''t have bread on hand, I substitute large croutons.  Thanks for a keeper Bill!REVThis was pretty good.  Definitely a departure from the traditional thin french onion soup.  I especially liked the method you used to thicken it and will use that method in other recipes.  Thanks for posting!REVI loved this soup it was so yummy!  I ommited the white wine and i used provolone cheese!  Really good will use again!REVThis St. Louisan TOTALLY AGREES that this has got to be the BEST Onion Soup ever!!   I worked downtown near Famous Barr and we would go there often just for the soup!   
Darlene, St. Louis, MOREVOutstanding recipe!  I used 14 stick butter plus 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and only 12 cup of wine, otherwise it was made to direction and it was to die for! it didn''t need the caramel coloring  Thank you for a wonderful recipe REVOMG this sounds heavenly. I am going to make it tomorrow night. I have some delicious candy onions and they should work out great!
This must be from a 5 star restaurant!
I''m psyched! HotPepperRosemaryJellyREVThis is one outstanding soup!  I followed the directions to the letter and it came out really well.  Loved the addition of the wine with the beef broth.  Such good flavors in this soup. We loved it here! DonREVThis is a good recipe but I doctored a bit.  Added 2 slices of apple wood cured bacon to the onions, very nice flavor.   I halved the recipe but slightly overdid the pepper.  To make up for this, i added 2 full cups of a dry Bordeaux and 2 cups of beer.  I also added a couple of drops of tobasco to offset the heat from the black pepper.  Also added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  Half recipe made 4 large bowls with a little bit left over, everyone cleaned their bowls out.  Wow, what an amazing tasteREVLove onion soup,sorry but not this one. I belive too many onions.
had a strange flavor. Made no changes.REVI''ve been craving French Onion Soup and this one definately filled the bill. As much as we enjoyed it the day I made it, we enjoyed it even more the second day, and I still had some to freeze for later.  Thanks, Brother!REVThe broth from 103403 with this recipe as a guide is wonderful. So if you are looking for a double duty recipe, start with 103403, then serve this yummy soup with the extra broth the next day or so!REVThis was wonderful!  I made the recipe exactly as described and I can only say I wish it made more. I could eat this every day.  Thank you so much for a delicious recipe!REVSorry but we were disappointed.  I had made a different recipe and it was much better.  This took three times as long and didn''t have the flavor.REVLoved it! Comfort food at its best!REVThis is absolutely the best recipe for French Onion Soup. Having grown up in St. Louis and frequenting the Famous Barr restaurant, I truly appreciate being able to make my own batch of this yummy stuff, and have lots leftover. Will post my pics soon. THANKS!!!REVWe had three dinner parties in a row and served this each night.  All loved the soup. We used vermouth for the wine.  Will make over and over.REVBest French Onion Soup ever.  I think the paprika, butter, and the slow cooking is what makes it stand out.  I didn''t have any beef broth but cubes and a can of consumme.  I never used wine but maybe next time I will, as it will be the recipe I use from now on!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!REVThis is delicious.  DH said sweetheart this is wonderful.  Can''t beat that ha?  I added a little cayenne at his request but he likes cayenne in almost everything.  GloriaREVOH MY GOD!  I just made this soup to serve for Christmas dinner and just off the stove, it''s divine.  I know I have to let it sit overnight to let the flavors meld, but I couldn''t help getting a crescent roll left over from last night and dipping it in some soup that I didn''t put in the refrigerated container   so yummy.  

I made French Onion soup years ago a different way and it wasn''t nearly as good as this.  I didn''t add the caramel color or the kitchen bouquet, it seems to be darkish without it.  

I also halved the recipe for 8 people, but I think that if you''re serving 8 you should just make the entire recipe.  It made about 4 qts of soup but if I put it in my crocks wthe french breadcheese, they may look a little bit low.  

Just make the whole recipe and you won''t be sorry.REVThis soup is outstanding! I was tempted into making it after ordering a terrible FOS in a Cheltenham restaurant last night. 

I had to cut the receipe down quite a bit  used 2 very large onions, reduced amount of butter and seasoning and then one part beef stock, one part dry wine and one part Joubere beef gravy instead of the flour.  Probably sounds like a hatchet job, but it has turned out to be absolutely delicious!  Did not have to use the caramel colouring or the kitchen bouquet.  I''ll be serving it tomorrow for lunch, with the bread and gruyere, and I can''t wait.

IMHO, what makes this recipe is taking the time to slow cook the onions and adding a good, dry wine like Sancerre.  Thanks Brother William!!REVGood for my first try.REVSuper delicious winter warming soup! Great recipe for a classic! Make much more than you think you need, it will all be gone!REVFantastic!  I didn''t have any paprika, so I skipped it and I didn''t add the carmel coloring, I just cooked the onions to a deep golden brown. This recipe is definitely a keeper!REVMy Dad drives to the nearest Outback every other week about 1 hour away just because he LOVES their french onion soup.  So I surprised him and made this when we had my parents over for dinner last night and he LOVED it!  He had 4 bowls of it! I wore swim goggles while I cut the onions!  I made according to the recipe but omitted steps 8,9,10. I also did not use the bay leaf. We served this along with a pork loin and 4 sides and no one hardly touched anything besides the soup!!! We served with Pillsbury Crusty Rolls. LOVE IT!REVNice flavor, really nice color to the soup without using the coloring.REVLoved the  soup. Recipe was easy to follow.  Didn''t use coloring, mine was dark enough. Only change I made was cut out 2 cups of the broth, I like it a bit thicker, and added a splash of worchestershire sauce for a little bite.  Other than that, it was awesome!
Thanks Brother William for a wonderful comfort food.REV5 stars!  I''ve never made French Onion Soup before, but enjoyed it out at a restaurant. This was easy to make and my husband and I both enjoyed eating this on this cold winter night.  I think next time I will make this using home made beef stock.  The addition of the wine really makes this superb. We both agree this is better than we''ve ever had at a restaurant!  Thank you so much Brother William for sharing this wonderful recipe!REVExcellent soup.  The whole family really enjoyed it!  BTW there was no left overs for tomorrow.REVexcellent.  i also added a bit of worcestshire, and also added a little garlic. used Riesling white wine and dipped sour dough bread.REVIf I could give it 10 stars I would. Me and my family loved it, easily the best I''ve ever had. The only changes I made were using part beef brorh, part beef consomme what was on hand and I added about a tablespoon of molasses suggested from one of the reviewers.REVAbsolutely fantastic soup.  Impossible to mess up, even better, it makes itself.  Referred this to many friends who have trouble in the kitchen and it continues to please.REVTo us the soup was missing something.....we added a little onion powder, and some cumin, and some garlic salt, but it still was missing something.
We didn''t add the White Wine, as we forgot to pick it up at the store, so maybe that was it...
Otherwise it tased pretty good, onions were sweet and not an overpowering onion flavor, and once we ate it with some cheese and croutons it was even better...
still trying to figure out what its missing though.....hmmmmmmREVI used 8 cups homemade pork broth and 4 cups french onion dry soup mix. Tasty.REVSomething my Dad taught me. Add a couple of Tbs. Brown sugar, or Molases');

While they were very moist and juicy they were neither garlicy or especially limey.  I was just hoping for more tang.REVYummy! These took me less then five minutes to prepare, I marinated them for about two hours but I think the flavour would soak in better if I did it overnight.  The chicken was moist and very moorish.  Thank you troyhREVI found this recipe just ok, nothing special.  It had a hint of lime and I added more garlic so the taste was there, but it wasn''t anything I would make again.

Thanks for sharingREVThis recipe was included in Book228608.  December 9, 2008  This is a terrific recipe! It only took me 5 minutes to prep it and put it in the fridge to marinate. It is so delicious and I loved the combination of lime and garlic. Thanks for this keeper  everyone LOVED it!REVWe really enjoyed this great recipe.  Easy yet filled with flavour.  I didn''t add any salt to mine...just pepper. Will be making this alot as DH hummed through his dinner.  Thank you for sharing.REVThese were really bland, almost tasteless.  I followed the instructions exactly, and we were not impressed.REVNice flavor. I cooked mine on the grill and served with green beans and mashed potatoes. It was a hit! Thanks for sharing troyh!REVThis recipe was delicious but next time I will slightly decrease the lime juice and increase the garlic. I also added a little smoked paprika which gave it a nice flavor. I baked the chicken with the marinade then served over a bowl of steamed mixed vegetables to make a low fatcarb meal. The juice of the marinade gave the veggies great flavor.REVAwesome.  I marinated them for about 30 hours and they were so tasty!!!!  I have to admit that I cooked them in the microwave. . .yes the microwave. . .for 11 minutes on power level 7, turning half way.  They were super moist and juicy.  On top of that, they produced a wonderful chicken broth that I thickened up with cornstarch and used as a sauce.  OMG it was so good!  Next time I will have some mushrooms and capers ready to throw in my sauce.  A true keeper!REVI''m doing the low carb thing and this recipe fit the bill. Not only was it low carb but it was easy and delicious too! This was one of the few low carb dishes that DH enjoyed eating with me. Thanks for posting!REVHad these for supper tonight and they are wonderful !!!!! Thanks for the keeper !!!REVThis is easy but very, very garlic.  Too much garlic taste for us and we like garlic.  Could not taste the lime at all.  Will not be making this again.REVEasy is an understatement!  We had guests for dinner last night and this was a hit with everyone.  I substituted lemon juice for the lime can''t find the stuff locally and grilled them outside on the BBQ.  Served it with some plain seasoned couscous and a veggieladen salad.REVOh, my!  Easy and absolutely delicious, I asked my friend to grill them on the BBQ after I had them marinate all day, everyone loved it and there were no leftovers, even though I had done extra.  Thank you, Troy!!!!!  These will be made often at my house.REVBF and I both think Lime should be in the title of this recipe. What wonderful flavor the fresh lime juice adds. I marinated all night as suggested and baked not grilled as the others had. Wonderful dish! Followed directions exactly. Served with garlic green beans and some cheesy potatoes.REVA simple easy to make dish with moist and flavorful results. I baked mine after marinating overnight. Will try grilling next time. Thanks.REVThis was quite easy to make and the chicken was very moist.  We could detect a hint of the lime juice but not really the garlic and I used extra garlic.  The chicken was marinated for 5 hours.  This is a great dish for a quick and easy meal!REVGreat chicken!  Since we love garlic, I added a bit extra to this.  We cooked the chicken on the barbeque and it was delicious.  The lime really gives it a nice flavour!  I''ll be making this again!REVThis really was yummy, and made the house smell really good!

Next time I think I might marinate less time, or on a different shelf of the fridge, so the oil doesn''t clump up.REVThis was so easy and the chicken we grilled was so juicy!  I marinated overnight.  Next time I will bake to see how that tastes.REVthis was really good. i added more garlic and doubled the recipe so i would have left overs.i put the left overs in my spaghetti with meatballs. i have to tell ya it was screamin. thanks troy.

All in all, thanks for a good recipe.REVUPDATE to original review 111208 under chef Sharon123 After reviewing both recipes posted under Carole Reu who hasn''t posted anything since 91299 and Sharon123, I need my review to capture the complete recipe I originally reviewed, which is Sharon''s. Carole''s recipe isn''t exactly like Sharon''s and I need to note the differences so that I can continue to make the recipe I love as stated in my original review including Sharon''s changes to the instructions. In my opinion these two recipes are different however, this is food.com and I don''t get to make that decision, as the food.com elves have merged these two recipes, hence my notes to self in the form of this revised review.  INGREDIENTS ignore the 2 cups soybean flour, use 2 cups lentils versus 1 cup, and 5 tablespoon olive oil. DIRECTIONS Step 3  use blender  Step 8  place into 4 greased loaf pans Step 9  let rise until doubled in bulk and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour.Sharon''s intro says, This bread will supply protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. Plus it tastes good! Prep time includes time for the dough to rise. Made during Bible times, this is a Middle Eastern bread. Next is my original review modified for the directions Going into this I didn''t realize it made 4 loaves! If I had I might have tried to scale it down a bit. So, drawing upon the strength of Ezekiel, I made it as directed! This also didn''t fit my plans to use my KitchenAid mixer  too much volume! I had to make it by hand, which fortunately was therapeutic and cathartic. If you make it by hand because you don''t have a commercial appliance, triple the estimated time it takes to make! Now that I''ve captured my thoughts on this, I can say that I give it 5 stars because IF you can put this together, the results don''t disappoint. You may just have to use your brain on this one, and your heart! Thanks, Sharon123! Made for bHealthy Choicesb.REVI''m going to make it today. The thing is though, is that in Ezekiel 4 it mentions NOTHING about soybeans. Those are not good to put in our bodies. Why do these recipes add those in when it was never part of YHVHs orders????');

I poured the batter into 5 mini loaf pans.  2 without nuts and 3 with walnuts.  My family loved the ones without the nuts.  My 17 year old son loved it, as well as my husband. REVI cut this recipe in half bc I needed eggs for a breakfast casserole I was making to go with it.

I was skeptical of the batter once it was all mixed, it seemed really really thick, and when the apples went in I thought it was way too many apples but I kept with the recipe and it turned out fantastic.

It has replaced the usual banana bread that I always make.  I added 12 teaspoon apple pie spice and I have never added nuts to this bread.  It is delicious.  I also baked the bread at 325 degrees for 60 to 70 minutes.  It does freeze very well, I just got a loaf out of the freezer from August, over 4 months ago, and it was just as good as being freshly baked.

I added a dash or two of nutmeg and baked it at the suggested alternative of 325 for 70 min. Came out perfectly!REVWe really loved this bread, both flavor and texture.

However, I found it to be on the sweet side and I have only used half the amount of sugar!REVI also reduced the sugar by half and added some dried cranberries and have been told that it is the best fruit loaf that they''ve ever tasted when I made it on Father''s Day so I thought I''d bake it again this weekend.REVI didn''t change anything and it was fantastic. I used a couple of different types of apples because that is all I had, but it still turned out great.REVAwesome recipe! I made one loaf with walnuts and one without.  Both turned out beautiful!REVThis has become a family favorite in our house.  Very yummy and makes emough to share.  Freezes well, and works great in large or mini loaves.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!REVNice bread.  I did have to leave the walnuts out due to the fact that I''m using up what''s in the pantry before the move.  I liked the fact that it is fullof apple, I think the kids would have preferred a little less fruit.  Very moist and tender.REVI finally made this recipe been sitting on it all summer and it really is Awesome. I didn''t stray too much from recipe except I added about a half cup of raisins. I too cooked it at 325 F but used two foil pans and cooked it for 90 minites. Two thumbs up Johnson!!! I bet dried cranberries would be a good addition...hmmmmREVGreat bread,thanks.LindaREVGreat bread, just a bit on the sweet side for me though. That is just a matter of personal taste though.  I think I may cut the sugar back next time and see if I that helps.  I did substitute half of the oil for applesauce and the bread was still quit moist.  I will be giving these as Chritmas gifts and it is SUCH a nice change from the typical banana bread.  REVMarg  AWESOME, DELECTABLE, as DS said, best bread I have made in forever! So if I could give you 10 stars I would.The house smells wonderful and homey and the taste just quietly explodes in your mouth as you taste all the flavors and the textures. I cut the sugar to 1 13 cups for dietary reasons and it came out fabulous.  All else was followed as you wrote.  I cooked for 95 minutes at 325, time probably increased due to the 25 degrees outside The tops were crunchy and the inside was moist and delicious.  I can go on and on.  Everyone should try this.  It is a keeper and will be a regular from now on!REVThis has to be the best bread recipe I have ever used.  My husband is not a fruit bread kinda guy, but he ate almost 12 a loaf.

THANKS for such a keeper!!!REVI halved the recipe, and it yielded one nice loaf.  Thanks for an easy and tasty bread.  It will surely be made again.REVThis really is awesome!I''ve made this before, but apparently, I never rated it.Last time I used this recipe it was to make muffins. I left out the walnuts I don''t like ''em and added a bit of milk one or two tablespoons to be able to get the batter into the muffin tins. I baked them for 30 minutes at about 375F sorry, forgot to make a note of the temperature, so no guarantees and they came out delicious. My sister even said that they were about as good as the chocolatey things I baked  and coming from her, that means a lot! As a sidenode my apples were pretty much regularsized and yielded one cup of diced apple each.REVI have been on a Apple Bread kick lately and finding this recipe  rang true to it name.  So  moist with great flavor.  I baked it at 350 for 70 minutes.  Great recipe,thankyou.REVthis recipe is fantastic  i use coarse sea salt and extra walnuts  the result is salty, sweet, and disappears quickly.REVGreat recipe!  Very sweet though, even though I decreased the amount of sugar slightly.  I''ll just consider it a dessert instead of a healthy apple bread.REVThis was like a little taste of apple pie in a bread.  Delicious!  I used half oil and half applesauce and it''s very moist.  I was glad I didn''t halve the recipe as I had intended to do because we went through one loaf in one lunch between the 6 of us. And you''re right, the ends are just as tasty.  It was a yummy way to use some of our orchard apples.REVFabulous!  All 4 of my children and my picky husband loved this bread.  I used freshly milled flour and apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon and it was DELICIOUS.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!!REVThis bread was very good.  Everyone enjoyed it and I will make it again.  I used bread flour and baked at 325 degrees for 70 minutes.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I also posted 2 pictures, one with the batter in the pans and one when they were done.  Thanks again for a great recipe.REVthis is a great recipe!  Loved by all!  I substituted pecans for walnuts and added 12 tsp. of apple pie spice to give a bit more zip.  Yummy!REVThis turned out great!  I sent it with my husband to a Monday night meeting and it was gobbled down.  The recipe didn''t specify pan size, so I used 9 x5.  The loaves weren''t too scant, but I will try it again with an 8 12 x 4 12 and see if I like it better.  I also used granny smith apples.  I think next time, I will look for a not so tart apple.  We just bought some ginger golds at Costco and they are really delicious.  I think I''ll try them!  Of course, I used the full cup oil and it was wonderful.  Had to leave the walnuts out because I didn''t have them, but will have them on hand for the next time.  Mine was done in about an hour at 325 degrees, but my oven runs hot.  Time also might change if I use a smaller pan.  Marg, thanks for another great recipe and also for the specific baking time and temperature that you use!REVAbsolutely wonderful!!  So moist and tasty.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white, and also used half oil and half apple sauce.  It turned out soooo good and is definetely a recipe to keep for years!REVVery good.  I used 12 ww  12 white flour.REVI''ve made this bread twice now! It truly is awsome apple bread. Thanks for the recipe!REVIncredibly moist, rich, and yummy.  Easy to make, too!

Fresh Rosemary instead of sage 2 Tbsp. cracked black pepper 1 cup vodka 1 12 c. apple juice 12 c. lemon juice bottled 3 Tbsp. regular Olive oil 3 oz. Maggi Seasoning sauce.

The apples cooked beautifully and with the crispy topping, to which we added pecans instead of walnuts, it all blended nicely. We used nonstick baking spray to the baking dish. All I can say is that there was nothing left! Thanks so much for posting, Diane REVThis excellent recipe deserves more reviews!! I like an apple crisp without cinnamon but most I have tried add oatmeal. I like oatmeal toppings but I really enjoyed the walnuts in this topping. Very easy to put together and extremely popular around here. Thanks for sharing!!REVMy boyfriend is not a big fruit dessert friend, but he loved this. I found it to taste exactly like what I want in an apple dessert  so good, especially with a little caramel sauce and french vanilla ice cream. You don''t say, but I lightly greased the pan to keep apples from sticking too much. I found 3 Granny Smith apples to be the right amount.REVWhtsebring, you have a winner here. The missus and I really enjoyed this. I left out the nuts but thats because we don''t care for them. It was great. Will use the recipe again. Thanks.
GemBobREVMy husband raved about this recipe all night long.  I have not had a morsel of sugar pass my mouth in 5 months as I am trying to lose some weight, so finally, I caved and had a spoonful and he was right.  I made him eat the last piece for fear that my will power would not hold up.  He officially asked me to throw away his own grandma''s recipe and substitute it with this one.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.REVGreat recipe.  I made this this afternoon for dessert and there wasn''t any left.REVMy oh my this was good!  I did add in some cinnamon with the apples as we like it that way.  Thank you Mammy for this memorable comfort dessert that really warms my heart!  I served some with homemade whipped cream and others wanted vanilla bean ice cream.REVOh my goodness!!! This was the best apple crisp ever!!! YUM YUM YUM I will meke this again and again.');

I didn''t bake them, either, as I used Recipe69612 rather than store bought.  I''d say that this serves 4 adults.  Yum!REVExcellent Enchiladas! I used already cooked chicken breast strips from Costco to shorten the cook time and just heated it thru with the rest of the ingredients. They made great leftovers as well...I had all my coworkers drooling!!REVWhat a fantastic dish! I used green pepper and it worked out fine. Thanks for sharing.REVThis is so good. We used the picante sauce and then also put a can of enchilada sauce on it too cause we like them saucy and it was a bit dry for us but other than that is was a awesome dinner!REVThis is a really good recipe.  I did make some changes for a few reasons. I used canned chicken breasts because I was trying to test to see if this would be easy enough to make while camping. I still cooked it in the pan with garlic it just didnt cook as long. I doubled the garlic.. we are garlic fans round here. I used green enchilada sauce in lieu od picante sauce.  I like it better.  I also mixed in a few tablespoons of sour creme in with the 12 cup enchilada sauce to make it more like chicken sour cream enchiladas.  I also, based off another enchilada recipe I had my eye on spread the bottom of my baking sheet with a small layer of sour cream before placing the enchiladas in the pan.  Next time I make this I am omitting the red bell peppers... I ended up picking them out and my husbands wasnt a fan of them either... I will probably put in diced onion in with the chicken and garlic in lieu of red bell pepper.  We are also big fans of onion around here!  REVThis was a great recipe! I''ve made it a couple of times now and both times everyone really enjoyed them!REVHopping on the bandwagon... these are some tasty enchiladas!  I subbed regular onions for green and upped the garlic, but didn''t add any cheese inside the enchiladas I didn''t have enough, and I figured it would be lowercalorie that way anyway.  I like a creamy enchilada, so I worried these would be dry, but they tasted divine.  The little bit of bacon gave these a great flavor. Thanks! This will go in my recipe rotation.REVThis was a good recipe.  I like using the bacon grease to for the chicken, left it really moist.  I really don''t think the bacon added anything to this dish.  I even used good thick bacon with a lot of flavor.  At the end of the day, I would leave out the bacon.  The rest of the flavors were great.  I would add a little more spice heat to the dish.  I would also saute the peppers with the chicken a little longer to soften them up or use roasted red peppers to really add a great flavor.  Overall a good dish and a great starting point for a lot of different options.REVI was REALLY surprised with how simple and delicious this recipe was!  I substituted bacon bits to make it even easier and it was a hit with the family.  I''ve made it twice now and have added it to my cookbook.  Thanks!REVWow, this was great!  I love the fact that this can be made into a healthy recipe.  I used low fat cheese and wraps and they were excellent, even for those husbands that don''t fancy the low fat junk he loved it!!  I used chilli powder instead of cumin and I ommited the bacon.  I also used low fat cheddar cheese because it was all I had at the time.  Can''t wait till we have it again.... thanks so much!REVI, too, used enchilada sauce instead of the picante sauce. This dish is outstanding. Even better the next day!REVThese were a great hit!  Because picante sauce is just a term made up by Pace for their salsa, I used chunky salsa instead. These were great. I will make them again and again.  The only changes I made to the recipe were leaving out the bell pepper and the bacon and I also put the cooked chicken in the food processor for a few pulses to sorta shred it.  Then I  put it back in the pan and added the black beans.

Thanks so much for this recipe.REVFunny story  I made this for Freezer Tag 2008 and my ravening horde ate it all before I could freeze it.  So  nothing to do but make it AGAIN!
This is an absolutely delicious recipe.  I used salsa in the enchiladas and enchilada sauce over the top, had green pepper instead of red, skipped bacon the first time and added rice the second time because I was using leftovers from a weekend fiesta.  Either way, any way, whatever you add, these are simply delicious.  I froze the enchiladas cooked, then reheated in the microwave for lunch.  Very nice!  I also froze some extra filling by itself and that worked even better for us.  Thanks for a new family favorite.REVLoved it. It was a hit with my kids and my husband said he felt like he was eating at a mexican restaurant. I used Goya Canned Black Beans and I added white rice and olives to the receipe. I also used Taco Bell Medium Taco Sauce as the picante. I will definitely make this again.REVI used enchilada sauce instead of the picante and it worked just fine. Great  easy recipe!REVAbsolutely wonderful. Do not substitute out the black beans and then insult by reviewing this dish, they are absolutely essential. Serve with Recipe  255260REVVery tasty!!  I added corn but otherwise stuck to the recipe.REVThese are delicious! Not too hot, with good flavor and texture. I added pinto as well as black beans, as I''m a big bean fan. These were great to freeze, too I made about two dozen and they thaw well.REVWe really enjoyed these enchiladas. Instead of black beans I used a can of mexican dark red beans and shredded the chicken instead of cutting into bite size pieces. So easy to make!REVWonderful.  I love these.  Not too hotspicy, which is good for my family.  Thanks, I''ve made these several times.   REVThis sooo good!  Even my picky eaters ate it.');

I also sprinkled salt and freshly ground pepper on top before putting in the oven, and omitted the cayenne pepper.  Will make again sometime.  Thanks for sharing Sean!REVTonight was my DH''s turn to cook dinner.  I was going shopping and he asked me to buy some fish  whatever was on sale and looked good.   When I came home w haddock he went right to the computer, logged on to my account on ''zaar and searched for haddock recipes.  I''m so proud of him .  This is the recipe he decided on and was it ever yummy!  There were only 3 of us eating tonight so I only purchased 1 fillet which was 1  pounds.  My DH adusted the recipe for 3 servings so perhaps we had more topping than the recipe intended but we thought it was a perfect amount.  He used a liberal shake of red pepper flakes in lieu of cayenne pepper.   The recipe did not mention anything about the skin.....my DH placed the haddock skinside down in the baking dish, and hoped the fish would seperate from the skin like it does when grilling.  However the skin came along with the fillet so we just took our bites from the top, scraping them off the skin.  I think I''ll ask the fish guy to remove the skin for me next time I buy haddock.   My 12 year old DS thought the fish was too spicy, not spicy hot but just too spicy.  We scraped the topping off but he still just picked.his loss!  DH served with basmati rice and a salad.   Will definitely make again.REVMMMMMM Mouthwateringly delicious!!!!!
  Followed recipe to the letter and it came out simply scrumptious!!!

My only complaint is I found the term batter to be misleading. I would describe it more as crumbs. This wasn''t a problem when making the crust, you just press them into the pan, but it did make it difficult to prepare the lattice top. Next time I would either add a small amount of water to the reserved crumbs to form more of a pastry dough before rolling out or just sprinkle the crumbs on top.

I cooked it uncovered and the tomatoes that were on top burned horribly.  They were inedible and I had to throw them out.  This wasn''t too much of a problem for us since the dish was still excellent, and my husband and daughter aren''t big tomato fans but I thought I''d mention it anyway. I think next time I might just add a little bit of tomato juice instead of the tomatoes since as near as I can tell the juice is the only thing that added anything to the dish.REVThis recipe needs everything that is on hand, it is easy, and it is really good! I wasn''t sure about the potatoes being cooked well I seem to have problems so I put them in the microvave for a minute or so to soften them up a bit. I didn''t have a can of tomatoes, so instead I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and poured it on top. Following that, I sliced up a couple of fresh tomatoes and put them on top. It turned out wonderfully! I covered it with tin foil while cooking for an hour and a half. I am going to make this one again! Thank you for sharing!REVThe directions didn''t say how big or thick to slice the onion and potatoes so my potatoes were too big and didn''t get done even after two hours.  This is a plain jane meal, very bland.  It was easy so I will make it again but will be adding much more seasonings starting with garlic and jalapenos.  I don''t want to put anyone off from trying this because it is soooo easy, but when you do, I recommend using some garlic and other personal preferrence spices.  Try it but tweek it to your own tastes.');

Great flavor with a cool pink color!REVI followed the recipe to a tea,  and I hate to say it looked like rubber and tasted like it. Maybe I am doing something wrong.  Maybe just not my idea of light and fluffy pancakes. Sorry CeeDee.REVThis is a very good recipe and the pancakes have alot of flavor.  I have added vanilla and cinnamon just for fun.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 teaspoon because they were very sweet once you add syrup.  It is now our go to recipe for pancakes!  Thanks!REVYummy...I wouldn''t try to say they taste like McD''s but I found the texture to be similar and my kids loved the idea of using soda in their breakfast! I''m keeping this one for the next Girl Scout camp out!  Thanks!REVThis is my goto recipe for pancakes.  I actually use 34 cup of carbonated beverage.  I also add just a drop or two of vanilla extract.  If the batter is too thick, just add a little bit more liquid.  This is a really good recipe.  The pancakes turn out fluffy everytime.  This morning I did not use a blender, just whisked it all together and let it sit for 10 minutes.  It also doubles very well.REVThis recipe is very good. I used Heart Smart Bisquick instead of the biscuit mix and I used Splenda sugar blend to help cut down on the fat. Next time I will use diet 7up to help in that area, other wise the recipe was great, family loved it.REVJust an update  the whole family enjoyed the modified version of this recipe that I made yesterday!! No one actually knew that there was Sprite in them except MIL  because most are extremely picky about what they will eat.
Again, my modified version is that I used 12 cup Sprite before I used diet TwistUp and added it to my Recipe 242192.
These were even great warmed up the next day!! Thanks for the idea of adding the Spritetype soda!!REVLuv the fluffy texture.REVVery good pancakes. Will probably cut back to 12 cup 7Up next time.REVThis recipe makes very tasty pancakes.  I wasn''t able to quite get it to be the same texture as McDonald''s hotcakes  but this is still a good recipe.  Very fluffy pancakes.REVIts light and fluffy but its tasteless.

Very soft, light, and fluffy.REVthe pancakes were very light and fluffy. 
Nice flavor, nice texture.
I agree with the previous post... I had to had some milk to thin the batter a bit.
Next time I make this, I will add some cinnamon or spice of choice!
Thank you!REVOMG, these are great! I was looking for something faster than scratch, but more interesting than plain baking mix. This fit the bill, perfectly. I did have to add about 12 C. of milk to thin, as the batter was too thick to scoop. But with that only addition, they were super! Very highrising and light and fluffy. DH gave them 5 stars. They were delicious with Louisiana cane syrup. Thanks so much for sharing, CeeDee!REVThis recipe does not taste like McDonald''s hotcakes nor does it look like them.

I cut and fry the chicken or pork and he handles the sauce from start to finish. He likes it so much he makes extra to give to some of his teachers who also fell in love with it at a school potluck banquit for his wrestling team. Thanks for sharing this with everyone.REVThese are truly delicious chicken wings, primarily because of the yummy sauce.  I literally can''t stop licking my fingers after eating each wing, and the sauce is so easy and has a very nice zing to it.  I''ll be making these often, and thanks for sharing.REVThis is the absolute favourite dish that I make.
I remember when my mother first got this recipe REVvery close to the real thing!REVI''ve been using this recipe for about 6 years now. It is an excellent recipe. I like to add 1 crushed chicken bullion cube to the flour mixture. It make it taste even better!REVThese are terrific.  We had these at our last hurricane party and since we had no electricity, I cooked these on the grill over medium heat for about 1520 minutes.  They were so tender without all the added fat from the oil.  A must try!REVThese are excellent. I have probably made these about 20 times.
We can''t get these at the KFC in Canada. Lucky for me when I was visiting the US a couple of years ago, I was able to try these wings at KFC in Virginia. I would not be able to tell the difference in taste. You have got to try these. Awesome and I don''t even use the MSG.REVI REALLY like this I added some hot sauce to spice it up a little this is OUTSTANDING!REVThis takes a while to make but it is well worth it.  Instead of using wings, I used chicken breast sliced into strips.  I also omitted the msg.REVWe thought this tasted great almost just like the real thing.  We liked the sauce so much that I will be using it on other bbq recipes!');

They are more like shortcakes, shortbreads, British biscuits or American cookies........slightly soft in the centre and crispy on the outside. The dough is easy to make and roll out  I used small sized scone cutters to cut mine out. There was no salt in the recipe and I thought that might be why some reviews said they tasted doughy, so I added 14 teaspoon of low salt to enhance the flavour. I halved the recipe to make 10 biscuits and used 2 teaspoons of ground ginger and a pinch of cayenne pepper. They were subtle and quite spicy, not as spicy as I thought they might have been  I may add more ginger next time or use freshly grated ginger root. They took about 20 minutes to bake on the middle shelf at 180C. We enjoyed these with a cup of tea today. I am glad I tried these out  I suspect they may even need to be harder, more like a spicy rusk  pleasant biscuits that were not too sweet. Thanks for posting!

 thanks so much for a great fudge.REVI made this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I stocked up to make some for Christmas. Only trouble was, kind of messy and sticky to pick up by finger but I did not leave at room temperature loosely covered after I cut it   maybe that is the reason?  Any ideas on how to modify the recipe at tad so it won''t be quite as messy?  Thank you for a great recipe!REVI made this fudge and it was sticky. I let it set over night covered, and the next morning I could not cut it into peices, and could not get it out of the pan.REVThis was very delicious and creamy.  My husband is not a fudge lover and he really enjoyed this version.  I usually make it the traditional way with a candy thermometer and this was much easier.  While it did set for me, it was much more soft set than I am used to, almost truffle like in firmness.  I think someone who does not like the cloyingly sweet traditional fudge will really like this recipe.  And it is MUCH easier than regular recipes.REVThis recipe is great! It was simple to make and it was a huge hit at my family''s Christmas dinner! Very soft, creamy and tasted great! I will make this again! Thank you!REVReally delicious,Ann. So smooth and creamy!REVThis recipe was much quicker than any other fudge I''ve made...and I''ve made a lot! It was easy to make and simply marvellous to eat!REVI made fudge! Though an accomplished candy maker, until now fudge is the one treat that has always alluded me.  My results have been smooth but not set or set but grainy.  This was was just devine in its taste and consistency.  A rich creamy chocolate nirvana, this did not have that oevrly sweet taste that you get in some fudge recipes. And it was incredibly easy.

Thank you MargeREVI made this Thanksgiving Eve. I followed the advice in the reviews and used about half of the cake mix and 12 cup butter.

LOL..so easy and so good.Try it and you won''t be disappointed.Thanx Marg,  for a super simple great delicious recipe! Chef Judi ColemanREVI love this recipe. I made this for my 1st time this past Easter and my family ate 2 whole pies.  I did however only use 12 of the butter and 12 of the cake mix and put the ingredients into 2 pie shells. It still tastes GREAT and I will make it many more times.REVMy family has been making variations of this recipe for years. I use spice cake,  about a cup of sugar, a stick of butter we prefer rich desserts during the holidays, and walnuts. This is indeed a forgiving recipe, so by all means adjust to your own tastes. It039s very good with a dollop of whipped cream or a little ice cream.REVI cannot believe I forgot to rate this last year!  This is so delicious.  I made this for dessert on Christmas Eve and got rave reviews.  A lot of my guests did not like pumpkin pie or pumpkin.  I am an avid lover and was looking for something to win them over.  This did the trick!  It is not too sweet and is so incredible.  Thank you so much for sharing!REVSo good! Used 12 cup butter and 23 of the cake batter. It didn039t come out as thick as I had hoped, so I just layered the pieces on top of each other looks like a layered pie, crust and nuts on the bottom with crust and nuts in the center and added whipped cream on top. It came out SUPER DELICIOUS!!!! Layering it is definitely is a good idea!REVThis was a hit with the family!  We used about half the butter and it was still awesome.REVVery good! Used the alternate amounts recommend for the butter and sugar, but used 12 of the cake mix, next time I will use the 23039s as recommended.REVYay, I found a recipe I have been using and which I get requests to make... so glad I don039t have to input it myself.  Thanks for posting!     This is delicious and my extended family prefers it to pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.REVThis was absolutely delicious! I read the reviews and decided it was going to be too sweet for me also, so I did change some of the ingredients. I did it differently than most reviewers. I figured cake mix has the right amount of sugar if you like cake so I cut the sugar added to the pumpkin to 34 cup and used 34 of the cake mix and a little over half the butter. It turned out perfect!!REVWhere is the button for ten stars?  I absolutely love this dessert and I make it every year.  Smooth pumpkin on the bottom with a crunchy nut topping, and creamy whipped topping.  UMM!  Fantastic recipe!  Thanks!REVI''ve never made a dump cake before and found it very odd to sprinkle the dry cake mix on top and then stick it into the oven. However, it turned out great! I only used half of the cake mix based upon reviews from others that it was too sweet and I think that was a good call. I also only used maybe only 14 of the butter in the recipe. The full amount seemed insane! Even with the alterations it was great. Everyone loved it and raved about it and the entire pan was gone within an hour.REVThis was definitely a 5.  What a great recipe.  Made it for a party and it was a great success.  I did cut the butter in half and used half of the cake as suggested by other people.  It was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe, it is one I will keep and make many times.REVREALLY Yummy!!!!  I made 12 with pecans and 12 without!  Whole family loved it!  I will make it around holidays to take to family eventsREVVery easy to make, and smells delicious! I haven''t cut into it yet though REVWonderful dessert! Nobody in my family, myself included, cares much for nuts in dishes such as these so I left the pecans out. I have given this recipe out to people every time I have made it for a gathering. My mother even had people calling her for the recipe after she took it somewhere! I''m going to start just bringing copies of it with me! I use half the butter and cake mix called for. Good pumpkin dessert!REVI have to agree with using 12 the cake mix and 12 the butter. This is basically a pumpkin pie dump cake and for dump cakes I also use the 12 box cake mix and 12 cup butter. Really tasty and easy enough for my 9 year old DS to make for his contribution to Thanksgiving.REVWOW!! I made this for my Thanksgiving desert, and this will be served in place of pumpkin pie from now on.  It helps to reduce the cake mix and butter or margarine by half, so it''s not overwhelmingly buttery or sweet, and it leaves more of a pumpkin layer instead of a bar type dessert.REVI''m so sorry, but we didn''t care for this.  It was just okay for the first few bites, but then it started tasting way too buttery.  My husband even referred to it as that butter stuff.REVI loved this too, but agree that it could use about half of the cake mix for my family''s taste... a wee bit too sweet.  
Thanks for sharing. We will definitely make this again.REVI''ve made this a few times now.  My father will only eat pumpkin pie for dessert at every holiday until I brought this over and he tried it.  Now he won''t eat my pies anymore!!!  This was very good!  I''ve tired it with 12 the cake mix called for and with the full amount.  My mom with the sweet tooth loved the full amount.  I like it better with a little less, about 23rds.  It just depends on the level of sweetness you prefer.  Great recipe!  Thanks for posting it!REVThis was a smash hit at my Thanksgiving dinner.  The kids went wild over it.  Topped with whipped cream and enjoyed every bite!REVI dislike plain old pumpkin pie, and this was a hit. I used chopped hazelnuts instead of pecans, and it was very good. Next time I will double the filling to make it thicker. This has replaced pumpkin pie at my house!REVYummy! A great new way to serve a classic!REVThis recipe is a keeper at my house. This recipe is very easy to follow and prepare. Everyone enjoyed it very much. Thanks so much for sharing.REVThis is wonderful! Even my DH, who''s not a big fan of pumpkin pie, loved it! Thanks for a keeper, Marg!REVI had this at an event last weekend and loved it.Came home,found the recipe here and made it. Wonderful!!!Exactly the same.Thank you for posting.REVThis is an excellent dessert.  We had is for Thanksgiving  Canadian It was such a treat,I don''t care for nuts but they are so good with this....I used Andeabell''s suggestion to use less cake mix.  I used about one half of cake mix and it turned out well. This will be used again in my house many more times.REVMarg.....wow this was teriffic.  Instead of evap. milk, I used fat free half and half, used frozen I froze it pumpkin and also used splenda instead of sugar.  Got rave reviews at our family gettogetherREVFinally a GREAT pumpkin Thanksgiving dessert for us non pie making people!  It has been officialy entered into our traditional Thanksgiving menu.  I only put pecans on one half becuase my DS hates nuts, but he liked it so much that on his THIRD helping, he ate the nuts too! REVWonderful!!!  I took this to a church potluck and it was all gone in no time! DH also loves this one.  I will definately make this again.REVWe LOVED this recipe.  It will be served on Thanksgiving here from now on.  I gave it a test run last week.  Its SOOOOOOO good. REVI will never make pumpkin pie again!!! It just can not compete with the taste of this. I do agree with Sisty Gin in the fact that 12 to 34 of the cake mix  would be sufficent. Just a thought to use the remaining portion of cake mix, use apple filling or cherry pie filling in a 9x9, pour remaining cake mix over the filling, drizzle with butter and bake. Two desserts in the place of one..... yummy.REVThis is a lovely dessert.  Simple yet very rich.  I thought that the crunch layer was a little to thick as compared to the pumpkin layer.  I think I will use less cake mix and half of the butter next time.  REVI made this with no changes, very easy to make and I had all the ingredients in my pantry. Excellent! As soon as I tasted this I knew I had found a new family favorite recipe. I shared with a couple of my neighbors and they asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!REVThis is just too easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, sadly leaving out the nuts for a few finicky eaters around here.  The buttery flavor was really pronounced and the bottom layer was similar to a pumpkin custard.  I''m thinking this might need to be the dessert for holiday dinners.  Excellent recipe that we''ll make again!  Thanks.REVThis is sooo easy to make and so yummy!!! I made it for the first time yesterday and it is almost gone.  I will definitly make it again.REVAn outstanding easy, delicious recipe that everyone loves!!!  I have taken this to several parties and it is loved by everyone.  It is a must that you bake it in a 9 x 13 pan and serve with whip creamREVthis is VERY easy and oh so YUMMY!!!!! a family favorite!!!!!REVThis was a huge hit!!!  Replacing pumpkin pies forever in our house.  I doubled the filling and just used one box of cake and almost all of the butter.REVThis is my new pumpkin dessert.  The taste is great. Creamy pumpkin and crunchy topping.  I used skim evaporated milk, Splenda instead of sugar, omitted the salt and used 14 c of butter.  DH thanks you too!REVI loved this recipe....too much I am afraid...I could have eaten the whole pan.  So I took it to work where it was gone in no time.  Numerous requests for recipes.  Thanks!REVi served this to my card club this month, they all loved it and asked for the recipe. i give it a 5 star ratingREVWow.... What a keeper. The creamy pumpkin layer mixed with the crunchy toppping was delightful. I served this yummy delight to friends last evening. Everyone loved it. I''m thinking if trying butternut squash from my garden next time. Thanks for sharing another keeper. MaryanneREVThis was really good and easy to make. I only used 2 eggs I misread the recipe but it worked out fine. I didn''t add pecans as my kids don''t like them. Next time I would only use half of the cake mix and butter on top as I thought it had too much topping. Other then that we thought it was perfect!REVwonderful and easy to make, Made it yesterday and will be making it more and more. Thank you!REVReally yummy!! My family is totally addicted to this, and it is easier then making pumpkin pie...woohooo!! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, we will be using it often.REVThis is really delicious and easy to make.  Thank you for the recipe.REVMarg, I could have easily eaten the whole pan of this.  I made the mistake of trying a small I mean small taste so I could give a honest review, and I have to admit I ate another small bite.  And OH, I forgot to say I don''t normally care for pumpking pie.  I can see me using this many times to come.REVThis is fantastic!  I think next time I will use less butter but it was still delicious.  We topped it with butter pecan ice cream even though it didn''t need anything else.  Thanks Marg!REVMy sister brought this for Thanksgiving last night....  MMM..  Thanks Marg for a fabulous recipe!REVEveryone loves this dessert with the buttery, crunchy topping.  After making it a couple times, I decided to lower the fat and calories because we want to enjoy this dessert frequently.  So I used HALF a cake mix and HALF the butter, and the result was still outstanding  and there was plenty of the topping, as you can see in my photo.REVWe started making this about a year ago and it was an instant hit for us. Incredibly simple to make, and a perfect holiday or average tuesday night dessert. We cook asis, but skip the whipped topping.REVBecause health conscious about food additives, I am not usually a fan of recipes using prepared mixes. HOWEVER,when I ran across this recipe and the rave reviews I HAD to try it.  WOW. It is sensational.  I used half the amount of cake mix and butter, but may try it full force next time because there WILL be a next time, and a next. Thanks Marg for a quick, delicious dessert recipe with lots of Vitamin A!REVThis was absolutely wonderful!!!REVReally yummy!  I used half the amount of cake mix and butter.REVHolee Molee!  This recipe is da bomb!  I doubled everything except the topping.  Only used 12 the cake mix.  Didn''t have any punkin pie spice, so I made some using recipe 37298.  How handy is that?  This was very good, Marg.  And you did say it was caloriefree, right?!  REVThis was a favorite at our 60person family Halloween party.  Everyone loved it!  I made three pans, and they were all gone!  It was very simple!REVDelicious. I forgot to buy the pecans, but other than that  followed the recipe exactly. Next time I won''t forget the pecans!REVThis was great!  I made it this afternoon in an effort to give the kids a slightly healthier dessert.  I used splenda in place of the sugar 12 c splenda, 12 c splenda brown sugar, ommitted the pecans because I was out of them, and used 13 box cake mix and 1 stick of butter.  I sprinkled the cake mix over the top, then used a frozen stick of butter and a vegetable peeler to peel thin curls of butter off the frozen stick, then laid them on top.  Turned out perfectly!  The kids and I loved it.  Thanks so much for posting!');

I loved the golden raisins and will add more than a cup next time. Also, I had extra batter left over and made some muffins which only took 30 min. to bake instead of 45.

My kids love these.I use half whole wheat flour for the flour and cut the sugar to 1 cup.I used Recipe 78579 for nonstick coating and it works like a dream.  I used the rubber muffin pans and cooked 6 in the microwave for 3 minutes.  It says you shouldn''t need non stick coating in the rubber pans but I always have issues so the non stick stuff works better than paper wrappers.  Enjoy!!REVYum!  I used Splenda, and Hershey''s cinnamon chips instead of chocolate.  Excellent warm with a glass of milk.  Thanks for posting!REVYum!  I subbed 1 tbsp of flaxseed  3 tbsp of water for one of the eggs, subbed 1 c of oatmeal, and 23 cup of WW flour, with the remaining 1 13 cup being regular flour, added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of vanilla, and cut the mini chips back to 34 cup.  Just trying to health them up a bit more even.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!REVVery yummy muffins.  My modifications were  egg substitute, no oil added 12 cup applesauce, 34 cup sugar plus 12 cup splenda, 2.5 cup flour plus 12 cup oat bran and only 10 oz. mini chips.  They were so moist  it''s amazing there is so little fat.  Thanks for sharing!REVWhat a muffin!  Made half without chips  half with regular choc chips. didn''t have mini  I had without first  decided 4 or 5 stars.  Then after the choc chip one, my DIL said 6 stars!  Absolutely delicious!!REVYummy. 5 WW pts per full muffinREVDelicious muffins!  Made them exactly as posted and my only complaint is that the muffins stick to the paper cups and so much is lost with the wrapping.  I will either try them without the paper cups, or go for the unlight version.  Wonderful flavor and enjoyed by all.  Thanks!REVExcellent recipe.  I made a half recipe since I only had 12 can of pumpkin left.  So, I cut everything in half.  I also added less than half the sugar only 12 cup.  I used only 12 c of miniature chocolate chips which was more than enough.  Next time I will use 14 cup if I am doing a half recipe.  I also used all whole wheat flour and all applesauce no oil.  THese were delicious and my kids loved them, too.  I will be making again!!!!REVThis has been my go to Fall recipe for the past 3 years!! I LOVE that they are low in fat AND ever so moist. I have replaced All the oil for applesauce and they get a bit rubbery in texture, plus they stick to the papers as noted by others. I would recommend adding 12 the oil recommended and grease the inside of the papers. I like more spice, so i add nutmeg. Try substituting Butterscotch chips for an Extra yummy treat!!! I also do agree about the amount of choc chips although i love chocolate it does overpower the pumpkin flavor a bit, so for a more grownup fall flavor, I would suggest halving the choc chips. I have raved and recommended this recipe to many friends and coworkers!REVI used fresh pumpkin.  I first cut it all up, steamed it, and the flattened it all with a fork.  I then measured it out to 16oz, and then put it in a blender with the 12 c of oil.  I live somewhere where it is hot everyday, and lots of humidity, so I did refrigerate the batter before I baked it. It turned out really good. Thanks for the recipeREVThis is a great recipe. I made both muffins and a loaf of pumpkin bread. The bread turned out better than the muffins. My muffins took longer to bake than stated in the recipe, but other than that everything was perfect. Perfect balance of chocolate and pumpkin. I used half wheat flour and half white in my bread and muffins and half the amount of sugar. I''ll make this again! Thanks, Marg.REVThey were surprisingly GRRRRRREAT!  I was VERY unsure about pumpkin and chocolate chips...  Like other''s suggested, I added a little oil with the apple sauce about 1 tbsp.  I used cinnamon apple sauce  also added in about 1 tsp extra.  I added a little nutmeg and allspice as well.  About 1 tsp. vanilla flavor and 1 tsp. butter flavoring were addedit''s what I had on hand.  Like others said, I only added 6 oz. of chocolate chipsi think any more would have overpowered the flavors of the pumpkin.  Oh, and I mashed up half a banana and mixed it in as well...   I experimented with this one and it really paid off.  Please guys...feel free to play around with this recipeit is super versatile!REVI love this recipe, It is so easy and delicious! brI also add one teaspoon of nutmeg as I find it gives it more flavour.brThe first time I used this recipe I used white chocolate buttons as that was all I had and it really was good, almost better then brown chocolate.brFor cooks outside of the US or where canned pumpkin is unavailable  I have used 1cup of crown pumpkin and one cup of butternut pumpkin diced and heated in the microwave and then stick blended, if you cant find butternut try 1 12 cups of crown and 12 a cup of kumara or sweet potato. Always cook the veges in the microwave or oven rather then boiling them as the extra moisture will give you a unwanted thinner pureeREVJust as good as the full fat version. Made in Wilton silicon cups  made 28. 400 degrees 16 minutes. Mini chips would be better but all I had was the big ones.REVGood muffins! Added 2t vanilla and used only 1 cup regular chocolate chips. Thanks for sharing the recipe!REVI made these using only 1 cup of sugar.  They were wonderful.  Thanks for posting.REVMy whole family loves these! We didn039t have any chocolate chips, so I used white and they give it a cream cheesy flavor. . I doubled it and subbed 2 cups of flour with whole wheat pastry flour. I added a handful of wheat germ and ground golden flax. I added 12 tsp of nutmeg, a few good shakes of cloves, and at least 2 tsps vanilla to the double batch. Thank you  I039ll make these again!REVamazing muffins . try addind choped wallnutREVI made these muffins last night and my family really enjoyed them. I scaled the recipe down to make only 12 muffins. I also used whole wheat flour and added a tsp of vanilla as well. I will make them again in the future.REVJust made these. They smelled wonderful in the oven. Unfortunately, mine didn''t cook through on the bottom well and fell apart and stuck to the paper as I unwrapped them. Guess it was all the moisture from the applesauce and pumpkin. I noticed this on the first muffin I tested and extended the cooking time but didn''t want the tops to burn. Gonna just slice them open and toast them as I eat them. Will definitely try again.REVWhat a treat! I made these for my grandchildren. They love pumpkin bread, pumpkin muffins, pumpkin bars.... These with the mini chips were a hit.REVYummmmy!  I made them a little healthier by doing half sugarhalf splenda.  Also I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour.   They were still moist and delicious.REVWow! So good!  I only used one cup of sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used gluten free flour and added 1.5 teaspoons of xanthum gum to mimic wheat flour. My husband and I can''t stop eating them!  Makes quite a few so I froze some for later.REVThis is the BEST muffin recipe ever! I modify it to make it even healthier and the muffins always come out light and fully and delicious.  
I use a combination of whole wheat flour, flax meal and oatmeal for the flour and a combo of mashed bananas and maybe only 1 tbps of canola oil.  I add blueberries, walnuts and a small amount of chocolate.  Sometimes I also add shredded zucchini.  My kids, husband and all of our friends love these!  Fail proof!REVThese were delicious!  Quite a hit with my grandchildren.  I would recommend refrigerating them for at least a day after baking before serving themmuch more flavorful than right out of the oven.  REVThese are so tasty!  I actually used a squash that had been recommended to us at the pumpkin patch as having a better pumpkin flavor then pumpkin.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour.  My muffin tins tend to be a little small, but I got 36 regular sized muffins and 12 mini out of this recipe.  I sent 12 to school with my son for class snack and we enjoyed the rest.  So glad I chose these for the photo swap 4!REVAbsolutely wonderful!!  These are the perfect taste of Autumn...the lovely pumpkin with the bit of chocolate and just the right touch of cinnamon spice...so very nice!!   I cut the batch in half and got a dozen regular sized muffins and 1 giant jumbo muffin cake for extra Fall time FUN!!  I used the mini chips as Marg CaymanDesigns had suggested in her recipe3564  LOVE the effect!!  I also added a bit of vanilla flavor to heighten the yummy factor also suggested in the other version of her recipe  Fantastic...my favorite muffin of the moment!!!  Great recipe  THANKS!!REVThese were even better than I expected.  Honestly, I was torn between whether I should make these the healthier version or the originals...but I''m very glad I went for these because I honestly couldn''t tell that they were made to be on the healthier side.  I halved the recipe and the yield was 16 muffins filled approximately 1234 full.  Bake time for my oven was about 18 minutes.  Very easy and quick to throw together with good results and a nice flavor.  My 3 year old had two of them already this morning.  Thank you for posting, I''ll be recommending this one to others and will definitely work it into the rotation again in the future!!!REVThese are delicious!  I am definitely keeping this recipe!  I also used 1 12 cups sugar and tasted greatREVI just made these for my daughter''s preschool class.  I''m sure they''re going to love them! So good!   This made 72 mini muffins, so plenty for us at home too.  
The recipe was so easy to mix up.  I didn''t have any mini chips, so I just chopped up some regular size chips in the food processor.  Worked great!  I''ll definitely be making these again.REVThese were the bomb!!!  So delicious and moist!  We used regular size Ghiradelli Semi Sweet Choc. chips and added 2 tsp of Vanilla it was absolutely delicious!   I hope they will freeze well, like the other review said, otherwise we will be eating them all!REVThese are wonderful muffins.  I made them for an after school snack today, and the boys loved them.  I used the 1 12 cup sugar and regular sized chocolate chips.  I added a dash or two of cloves and a few runs across the microplane with a fresh nutmeg.  I got 21 regular sized muffins from my silicone muffin pans using a large ice cream scoop.  We will definitely be adding these to the regular rotation!  Thank you so much for these wonderful fall treats.REVAfter making the original recipe, I decided to try the lighter version on my next batch. These turned out just as delicious as the fullfat version, and flew out of my kitchen just as fast. Thanks for the recipe!!!REVThese are so moist and perfectly muffin shaped!  I took them to a function and got many compliments on them.  People were very surprised they were low fat.  This recipe actually made 32 standard muffins for me.  I used 1 12 C. sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I also added 1 t. vanilla and a 12 t. ground ginger.    I used milk chocolate mini chips, which I really liked but I may try semi sweet next time.  I''ll be making these often!REVthese were very moist and tasty. i used 1 cup sugar and had maybe a half bag of regular size chips left. they came out delicious and baked 20 muffins. i will keep this recipe.REVThese muffins were good. I made half a batch because I had l cup of pumpkin that I needed to use. The half batch made 48 pretty little mini muffins. Thanks!REVYUMMY! I have made these muffins twice in the last week both were 12 batches. They are so moist and delicious. I made a couple of changes to make it fit my gestational diabetic diet Splenda and Stevia Plus powder in place of sugar, and all whole wheat flour. Normally I only subs. 12 of the flour with whole wheat, but these were so moist that going all out didn''t seem to make a big difference. Amazing and now my new favorite. REVGreat version of a great recipe. I tweaked even further using 34 c splenda and 12 cup sugar. Nice and light and a winner with even my picky kids! Decreased amountt of chocolate to 6 ounces of chocolate chunks, my kids saw the larger chunks as a treat within a treat!WendyREVThese were okay. One of my sons liked them and the other did not....and I just thought they were okay. Made for a decent afternoon snack, but I don''t think I will be making them again in the future.REVThese turned out good...but not great.  I did try to make them healthier by using half baking splenda and half whole wheat flour and maybe that hurt the flavor.  Would make again, but would use more sugarsplenda and less salt.  Thanks for a good base for light pumpkin muffins.REVThese were good and I like the fact that it makes 2 dozen muffins.  I did find the chocolate chips overpowered the pumpkin flavour.  But that is no complaint!!!  Who doesn''t like some chocolate in a muffin???  Thanks MargREVI made several modifications.I used one large can of pumpkin instead of a small one and a cup of applesauce.I substituted 34 cup Splenda brown sugar blend for the 1 12 cups white sugar.I used 2 cups white flour and one cup whole wheat instead of 3 cups white flour.I used a cup of chopped pecans instead of chocolate chips.I also added some nutmeg, cloves and vanilla in addition to the cinnamon.I made a dozen large muffins, a pan of gems mini muffins, and I scooped out the last six dollops about 2 tablespoons each onto a cookie sheet  these became pumpkinpecan scones.  People liked ''em!They were all good, but the gem size seemed particularly well suited to this recipe.REVThese are fabulous. I made them exactly to the recipe and got 29 muffins out of it. My kids loved them. I didn''t taste the pumpkin flavor that much but at least I''m getting some nutrition!
You really can''t tell this is a lighter version.REVI made this recipe exactly with the exception that I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  My family loved it and no one knew that it was a lighter version.  They were delicious and you could not tell that it contained applesauce.  I will begin substituting applesauce in all my muffin recipes.REVI made them the other day, pretty good although I had made a few changes to the recipe to make it healthier. I used 1 12 cups of pastry whole wheat flour whole wheat flour will also work  and 1 12 cups of white flour. I also added 14 cup of flax seeds to add more fiber and healthy omega3 oils, 60 cacao regular size bitter sweet chocolate chips to incorporate some healthy properties from the pure cacao instead of the mini chocolate chips and 1 12  cups of sugar instead of 2, also a pitch of nutmeg goes very well with the flavor of the pumpkin.

It''s great for a sweet tooth or for breakfast.  It''s so moist and delicious. Best pumpkin spice bread EVER!REVMade a bunch of changes, nothing too drastic.  Put 1 scant cup brown sugar and 1 scant cup white sugar, used the ''alternatives'', doubled the spices and added 12 cup oats instead of the last cup of flour, all of which was whole wheat. Oh, and I sprinkled in some ground flax.But the kicker was when I forgot to add the eggs and baked them into muffins, and they still turned out delicious! A little dense, but I certainly surprised myself!REVThis was great  I reduced the cloves as I''m not too fond of them, added 14 tsp ground star anise, and a package of Nestle chocolate chips.  Also used 13 bread flour, 13 whole wheat flour, and 13 all purpose flour.  I wouldn''t recommend this unless adding the chocolate chips.REVYUM, YUM, YUM!  This is fantastic.  I made the bread, but I also made minimuffins from the recipe cooked in about 12 minutes.REVJust made this.  It is pretty good, but even 60 minutes was a bit too long.  I think it needs more cinnamon, the cloves seemed fairly strong in contrast with the other spices.  I will make it again with changes.  Oh, I did make it with the applesauce instead of the oil and it was very moist.REVThis bread is wonderful!  I substituted fresh pumpkin for the canned and didn''t add water.

I made it exactly as written and it turned out beautifully.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!REVStellar!  I used fresh pumpking and homemade applesauce, which were a little more watery and so I omitted with 12 cup water entirely.  In one loaf I mixed in raisins and dried cranberries, which turned out great.REVWow, great bread. I did substitute all spices with 3 teaspoons cinnimon and touch of nutmeg. Thanks for sharing.REVI substituted nonfat plain yogurt for the oil and it came out perfectvery moist. I also doubled the cinnamon but left the other spices as written and it was perfect for our tastes. So good when still warm from the oven!REVI made the healthy version and it was super moist and scrumptious!! I did double the the spices per the reviews of others and it was PERFECT... absolute perfection. I would give it 10 stars if i could. only other change i did was to add chocolate chips for my husband REVI also used my own pumpkin, cooked and blenderized, and it worked out great. Instead of cloves I used cardamom, and I used part whole wheat flour. Overall nice warm taste and good texture. I do not have 2 loaf pans, so I put half the batter in a square cake pan. It worked well, and I could see making it again this way in order to top with a cream cheese icing.REVVery tasty, very moist bread! I used one cup sugar and one cup 100 maple syrup omitted third cup of sugar, which gave a very nice, subtle maple sweetness. I also used only 34 cups oil and omitted the 12 cup water to make up for the extra liquid of the maple syrup. Next time I would like to use applesauce and may also add some dark chocolate chips  yum!REVI made these into muffins for my children rather than a loaf.  The only reason for 4 stars is that 1 cup of sugar is enough!  I used butternut squash and mashed it myself.  Flavours are wonderful.  It made 20 large muffins.  I made half plain and half with choc chips.  The plain were great with butter, choc chip ones were great on their own.  Thanks for the recipe  a keeper!!!
ElizabethREVSo yummy!  I''ve made this recipe several times and this is what I do  I use 1 12 c sugar, add a bit of vanilla to the pumpkin mixture, and in addition to the spices listed in the recipe, I add 1 heaping teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  This gives it a bit more flavor and a little ginger, too.  And, I find that 60 min is too long50 minutes and then letting it sit in the pans for another half hour seems to work with my crazy oven.brbrI also add a pkg of milk choc chips and it''s so delicious!REVOutstanding!  I used fresh pumpkin, just 3 eggs ran out, but 3 worked fine and 12 cup oil.  I also added some ginger to the recipe and a cored, skined apple that I used the blender to dice in to small pieces.  The bread was extremely moist and tasted great.  Next time I think I''ll add some chocolate chips to one of the loafs.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.REVA great bread for the holidays. It is moist, flavorful and makes two large loaves. One to give away and one to have with coffee for us! I used two cups of sugar and loved the spice combination. Thanks for making our holiday season extra yummy! Carole in OrlandoREVI have been meaning to do this review for almost a year.  This is the BEST pumpkin bread recipe I''ve found.  I have passed it on to all of my friends.  Folks, before you start making changes to this recipe, try it as Marg posted it.  It''s great exactly as it''s written.  I love the cloves in the recipe.  Adds just the right touch.REVThe first time I make a recipe I always make it as it is posted and I am so glad I did that this time because it is perfect!  Great recipethe only thing I would maybe do differently is add a little more spices like slightly heaping as a matter of personal taste and some vanilla but really the recipe is great as is!  It is absolutely a great fall recipe and today was overcast and just felt like a baking kind of day...my house smells wonderful from this bread!REVA nice loaf.  I made my own pumpkin, so omitted the water like another reviewer and cut the sugar to 2 cups.  Next time I may add a tablespoon or so of molasses.  Looking forward to trying with applesauce!REVI made this bread with the applesauce option and 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar. I honestly felt a bit letdown, it just wasn''t very pumkiney. I made a cream cheese glaze which helped the bread a bit, but my vacuum cleaner hubby was the only one who really ate it.REVThis exact recipe has been in our family for over 40 years, and we just love it! Our kiddos are disgustingly healthy thank God!, so I don''t worry about the cup of oil...we don''t make it every week, and olive oil works perfectly well. brI do make these changes I use half regular flour and half white whole wheat flour. It adds a mice nutty texture, and some health benefits. I also tend to bake it in a 9x13 pan, since I have bad luck getting it fully bakes in loaf pans. brOur recipe calls for 23 cup water. I''ll try cutting it to see if loaf pan baking works better so thanks for that! brThis bread is quick and easy to make, and sooo delicious! It''s really tasty as a side dish with any poultry dish, and the kids love it for breakfast. Yum!REVI pulled the loaves out of the oven 20 minutes ago and just finished my first slice. I am in LOVE with this recipe! I am adding this to my personal recipe collection immediately! I made this just as written with no substituions and it turned out amazing! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!REVVery Good! I followed the suggested recipe subbing applesauce for most of the oil, reducing the sugar  although i used one cup reg sugar and one cup brown, becuase thats all i had. I also added a good cup of reconstituted raisins. The bread came out much darker than the picture shown  ill figure out how to post the pic i took of my loaf later, But it was still delicious. waiting for the final verdict from my Best friend who is a pumpkin bread fanatic.REVSO yummy!  I also made 12 muffins and 1 loaf of bread.  I had planned on freezing the loaf but the family went through 8 muffins at dinner so I think I better keep the loaf out for breakfasts and snacks tomorrow!  REVI used this recipe to make little pumpkin muffins. You''ll need about 3 muffin pans if you plan to do it that way, and they get a bit more of a crust if you don''t put them in the little cupcake liners, which IMO adds a bit of extra depth to the overall tastetexture of the muffins.brbrWhile we like the recipe asis, I''d definitely make some changes. I think I''d add a tad more spice, as it seems rather bland, although, some of this is cured after it fully cools and has time to sitno eating them warm from the oven!brbrAlso, I don''t know if anyone else noticed, but mine are a bit sticky to the touch even after being baked...I''m debating on adding a touch more flour next time to help reduce that so that they store a bit better. I also definitely plan to make the the healthier way next time, because I''d bet that really adds to the texture of the bread.brbrThanks for the recipe Marg!!! My little one is driving me crazy about pumpkin cookies. REVOutstanding recipe! This is the second time I have made this and it has come out great every time. My husband and kids love it, it''s great in the morning with a cup of hot tea. I followed the recipe but did use additional spices to pump up the flavor a bit. One thing I really like about this recipe is that all the ingredients except the pumpkin, possibly are all staples most people have in their pantry.REVI liked it. The recipe was fine as is. It was light and nice. I did take some liberties and tweak it the next time I made it. I did half coconut oil and half applesauce, half the sugar, added vanilla, extra spices, doubled the pumpkin and skipped the water. LOVED it that way! It had the flavor of pumpkin pie but it was still light and fluffy.REVVery good recipe! I followed it to the line and liked it a lot. However, next time I''ll try using more spices and maybe reduce the sugar a bit, as I found it maybe too sweet. But I suggest following the recipe as it is and make adjustments later according to your personal taste.REVYummy yummy yummy!! Everyone loved. ThanksREVI loved this bread. The only thing that I did different was to use 212 tsp. pumpkin pie spice but also added the cloves. I made one loaf and 12 muffins. My family just loved them that''s why I''m baking another batch as I write this  Definately a keeper, thank for sharing!REVThis was excellent. First time I have ever made pumpkin bread and everyone loved it. It was nice and moist with a lot of great flavor. I added black walnuts since my boyfriend loves them and I had a bag of them laying around. I am going to make more this weekend. Thank you for this great recipe. Its a keeper, for sure.REVVery Good!!  I used pumpkin pie filling as that is what I had on hand and it worked well!REVI''ve been meaning to do this review for months now.Yes,I love pumpkin bread and this was very tasty,nice and spicy!!REVThis was a great recipe for Colonial Days at my son''s school.  It was moist, but firm so it was easy to cut into bite sized cubes without getting mushy.  Delicious!REVMy home smelled delicious when I was preparing this!  I donated 4 loaves to our school bake sale  and they went fast!  Very moist and rose nicely.REVOne word  yummmy!  
I made this on a whim because I had extra pumpkin.  My husband took a loaf for his office Thanksgiving luncheon.  I got so many requests for this recipe that I decided to take 4 loaves to our family for Thanksgiving and am making 2 more loaves right now for our lunch guests coming tomorrow.REVDelicious. Wonderfully moist, with a great flavor. I''ve made this a few times now, and it is always a hit. Thanks!!REVA wonderful and easy recipe to follow. My friends thought it was delicious and asked for the recipe!REVVery good and really easy to make!!REVEasy to make.  We were out of ground cloves, but it was good anyway.  Next time we are going to try applesauce instead of oil.REVThis is awesome. I like it even better than Starbucks. Theirs is a heavier more dense bread and this one is light and fluffy. I cooked mine for about 80 minutes and i think it turned out perfect. Thank you for this awesome recipe. I will be making this for many years to come. It was so simple and easy to bake. A definate winner in my book!!!REVThis recipe produced fabulous results! The bread was moist and tender, with a wonderful flavor.  I made one loaf and 12 muffins and took them into the office. I received many compliments and was asked to share the recipe, along with a comment that the individual hoped I can make them as moist as you did!  This is a keeper!REVThis is an outstanding recipe. My boyfriend who is not a huge quickbread..or pumpkin fan..raved about it. He even asked me to make another batch so he could have some in his lunch everyday. Quite an endorsement from one so picky!REVThis is almost an exact version of Recipe 195348 which doesn''t have cloves, but I added the same amount that is here, which, to me, is also 5 stars. I made this recipe, without the healthy substitutes, and I added 1 tsp. vanilla to the wet ingredients. This bread makes the house smell so good, and turns out really well. Mine was done in 55 min. I am looking forward to trying the applesauce version, though. Thanks so much for posting that alternative!!REVI completely forgot to add the 4 eggs and this bread still turned out wonderfully! I made 1 loaf with diced pecans and 1 loaf without and both are delicious. Thanks for sharing!REVI made this for my son''s preschool class and it was a big hit.  I used the applesauce substitute, but I can''t wait to use the sinful recipe with all the sugar and oil!REVWonderful!
I love to add a little vanilla, leave out the water bc I use fresh pumpkin, add nuts and sometimes even some chocolate chips.  Thank you!REVThe best pumpkin bread recipe I have tried!  Easy  had everything on hand  and delicious!REVThis is excellent bread. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, 34 c applesauce, and 14 c oil.  Delicious, and will be made again. Thank you.REVI made the low fat version with applesauce and less sugar  and the bread came out fantastic. I made a full size loaf and a dozen muffins the muffins I baked for about 22 minutes They turned out extremely moist and very tasty.REVI rated this recipe a 4 because when I made this bread it did not rise as it should have or even at all. It remained very dense. I''d advise that you make sure your baking powder is not old like mine most likely was before baking this bread. In addition, even with extra spice added, the bread was not as spice intense as I''d hoped. After a day of trying to let flavors meld deeper it was still not as flavorful as I like it. However, it was still good! Thanks for posting.REVReally good texture and flavor.  I made this at work and based on the reviews I made a 4x batch.  I ended up adding some pecans and raisins to a few of the loaves,  Great recipe.REVIt really tasted wonderful! I used the lower fat applesauce version and reduced sugar to a little less than a cup. I added about  cup of raisins and pecans. I substituted 3 Tbsp. of wheat bran for a bit of a fiber boost for 3 Tbsp. of flour. I used my own canned pumpkin and weighed it out on a kitchen scale. Added 1 tsp. of vanilla since I canned my pumpkin without any spices.  I made a half recipe so I put all the liquid ingredients in the food processor with the pumpkin chunks. It worked out beautifully. Give this recipe a try. It is simple and will make everyone hungry just smelling it cook. Jim in So. Calif.REVWell, this is my Holy Grail of pumpkin bread recipes easy, delicious, wonderful texture and moist.REVVery good! It was soft and sweet. I used the applesauce and oil. stayed moist for a long time. I did how ever use pumpkin pie spice  the cinnamon insted of the others because it was what I had on hand. I will be useing this recipe in the future.REVsooooo yummy! i actually added rasins and frosted it with powdered sugar frosting! i know it naughty but so good!REVI''ve made many recipes of pumpkin bread but this recipe got rave reviews from everyone.  Great job and thanks for sharing.
I did however add raisins and walnutsREVA Definite Keeper. I split one loaf and shared it with neighbors. It was a hit, and one they won''t mind getting more of. Very easy to make, moist with great flavor.REVWonderful recipe! I made this in three small loaf pans and I''m taking one to my sister tomorrow when we go to her house for Thanksgiving dinner. It will make a great breakfast treat with a good cup of coffee. I used a cream cheese glaze on mine and it complements the bread beautifully. Love this, thanks for sharing the recipe.REVDelicious!  The bread came out perfectly.  I took it to work, and it was very popular with everyone.  I didn''t have any leftovers!I''m making it for TurkeyDay this week, and I think I''ll add walnuts to one of the loaves.  Mmmm.REVi loved the recipe.  the only issue i had was there were to many cloves in it so i took out half the cloves and added ginger now the bread tastes just like pumpkin pie.  i have neighbors begging me for it whenever i make it and i have to fight my kids and husband for a single slice   thanksREVA friend gave me this recipe, and I''m not a pumpkin bread lover.  This recipe is so moist and delicious I was pleasantly surprised.  Thank you!REVMy husband does not like pumpkin pie, banana bread, zuccini bread, or carrot cake, yet he gave this recipe his stamp of approval!  I am so relieved to find a festive bread that he actually enjoys.  Thank you, Marg!  As others noted, I added 1 cup golden raisons per loaf with great results.REVThis is so good! It is so moist. I substituted 3 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice for the spices listed in the recipe. I baked this in mini loaf pans for Christmas gifts at church. I put 34 cup batter in each pan and it made 8 mini loaves. I baked it at 325 for 4550 minutes. I will try next time substituting applesauce for some of the oil. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is wonderful!');

Thanks for taking me home again! Hope Bill Woo''s is still open! He would be proud.REVThis is definitely not something you can get in south Florida where I now live. I used to order this every week at my local Chinese restaurant, and still do whenever I visit Michigan.brThis recipe is good. The sauce is right on but the batter is wrong. First of all, forget the baking powder. Instead of using water, try clubsoda. It will give your chicken a crispier tempura like texture.Make sure the batter is on the thin side so that it dredges off easily. Use peanut oil or don''t make this dish! Regular veg or corn oil cannot get hot enough to really crisp the chicken without setting off smoke alarms!brAlso, the sauce does require 14 teaspoon of real Almond Extract to give it the authentic restaurant flavor we Michiganders know and love. Forget the mushrooms. They just water down the gravy. Use Iceberg Lettuce. It is the coldest, crunchiest to offset the warmth of the chicken and gravy.brI know this works because I experimented with this recipe until it was just like my favorite Chinese haunts in suburban Detroit.brAlso, change out the chicken for duck and make it Wor Su Opp!REVdredge ckn in pancake mix .  found that recipe on bob allison site he is a detroiter who worked  at local am radio stations .  he has many old detroit restaurant recipes from back in the day  . the sauce recipe here is better than the one he has listed .   watch the size of ckn pces as it will double or triple in size .REVNot 100 like I remember, but wasn''t bad. After reading reviews I didn''t use the baking powder. Also left out the mushrooms. Also, put 14 teaspoon of Almond Extract in the sauce. I used 2 TBS clubsoda in the batter 1 was not enough. Used peanut oil for frying. The directions didn''t mention when to add the dry sherry, so I just included it in the peanut oil. Took about 7 mins each side to cook through. Was easy to put together, but will try other recipes.REVTonkat just thought I039d let you know that over in Seattle, where I used to live in a suburb called RavennaLake City, there039s a fantastic blast from the past called Ying039s Chinese Food Drive In. When I lived there, they delivered THE best Almond Chicken with brown gravy you have ever tasted! I crave Ying039s Almond Chicken from here in Honolulu some 20 years later! And more awesome is the fact they039ve not changed a thing since back then same signage, chairs, menu on the wall and polaroids of each dish, it039s all like a time warp!

Maybe serve 4 instead.Don039t forget chopped scallions, makes all the difference.REVI moved from Washington State to California and now Arizona. All of the Chinese dishes are different. Almond chicken here and in Ca. is cubed chicken and vegetables with almonds. BBQ pork in Washington was pork tenderloin sliced thin with Chinese mustard. Here and in Cal. it is a reddish, fatty, ham like texture. I prefer the Chinese American Restaurants in Washington. Red Lotus in Auburn, WA was a family favorite when I was a kid. This is good but, I too, lightened up the batter by leaving out the baking powder and using club soda. More like a tempera batter and clear gravy with chopped almonds, no mushrooms.REVI made this several months ago, using duck breast. I followed the directions exactly, and it came out very much like our local restaurant used to fix, bit not quite. I''m going to fix it again this week and follow the quotclub sodaquot and peanut oil and almond extract. However, I''ll keep the mushrooms, using fresh instead of canned to keep the moisture content low. This is one of my favorite ways to make duck breast. Yum!REVI had no idea that this was a regional recipe either. Our whole family just loves it when we go out to eat. I made it last night and it was absolutely fabulous!!! I too left out the sherry and mushrooms. The sauce is dead on, but I can''t quite figure out how to fix the batter so it''s more like the restaurant version. I was thinking maybe it should have salt in it and omit the baking powder so it crisps up more like a fried chicken batter????REVI039m really looking forward to trying this recipe. I039ve been looking for a recipe for wor su gai for a long time. This is also a staple in Ohio. I039ve never been able to duplicate the wonderful brown gravy. Here in northern OH it039s also served with ice cold lettuce to enhance the hot chicken. It039s covered in a brown sauce amp topped with chopped peanuts amp sliced green onion. Sauce sounds just what I039m looking for, this was always served with fried rice at our restaurants here. Since I039ve moved I039m still finding wor su gai but it039s served over bean sprouts and with a gelatinous yellow sauce that reminds me of lemon pudding. Can039t wait to try this! Thanks Tonkats! Left 4 stars in anticipation!!REVI have been looking for a recipe similar to this for a long time.  I live in Canada just across the river from Detroit, and our Chinese restaurants have served this as far back as I can remember.  I haven''t tried the recipe yet, but I am hopeful it is the one I have been looking for.  I will rate and review it properly once I try it, but for now am giving it five stars in anticipation!REVMy Husband and I are both From Michigan. We now live in Tenn. and Have not been able to find this sort of Almond chicken anywhere. Thanks so much for the recipe it is the closest thing we have found to it.We will be useing this in our kitchen regularly.Do you by chance have a good egg drop soup recipe?REVBeing a fellow Michiganian, I thought the sauce was dead on!!!!  Only complaint that was heard this evening was from my DH who actually fried the chicken, was maybe 2 eggs would have worked better.  But we both agreed that when recipes are written, who knows what size of eggs are really used.  And who knows if the same sizes are offered in the areas.  Or, no offense to the momma chicks, but do they always lay the same sized eggs!!!  LOL.  Tonkcats, great recipe and we will be making over and over, well at least until the DS goes off to college!!!!  LOL This is his favorite dish oREVHaven''t tried to make this yet, so I can''t rate it.  I will try it though.  I just wanted to let Tonkcat know that War Su Gai does exist in southwestern Ohio, both under that name and under Almond Boneless Chicken.  I''ve had it with a variety of sauces...one very gravylike, the rest more oriental in nature.  It''s a great dish.  I''m anxious to try it at home.REVThis recipe is also served in Chinese Restaurants in Northeast Ohio and also Columbus, Ohio.  It is great.REVWhen I was a boy in Detroit I worked as a bus boy in Wing Hong''s Chinese American Restaurant.  I''m sure Wingy is either very old or dead by this time but the cries of War Sho GAI still ring in my ears along with our american response wash your OWN guy!!  My first attempt at this receipe was ok but not completely successful, never the less the taste was what I remembered and that earns it a five.  Be sure to use THIN cuts of boneless chicken so it fries up crisp.  Too thick a piece makes the coating soggy and therefore less edible.  This sauce will work best with rendered chicken fat.  I save what renders out when I broil chicken for other receipes for just this kind of dish.  Thanks for posting this Tonkcats.  It was a wonderful addition to my cookbook.REVI grew up in MI where I could get Almond Boneless Chicken at any Chinese restaurant I walked into. When I moved to NC I quickly learned that it was regional since no Chinese restaurant here knew what it was. This came in as a close second to the traditional Almond Boneless Chicken I can get at my favorite Chinese Restaurant. Thank you so much for posting it!REVI was looking for a recipe for Almond Chicken Soo Guy, and this was very close I guess that''s what we call it in Canada! It was very good, although I didn''t have any homemade chicken stock, which would greatly improve the sauce.  You could also adapt it to make Lemon Soo Guy with a lemon sauce instead of a gravy type sauce.  A bit of work, but will definitely make it againREVI liked the chicken and the almonds were a delicious addition.  However, I did not care for the sauce.  I suppose that could just be my taste, but I was thinking that something a little sweeter would have been good.  At any rate, it did make a nice midweek meal and I will explore other chicken and almond recipes.REVThe whole family enjoyed this dish.  I opted to use the mushrooms but 1 12 cups is a lot of mushrooms and sauce ended up being a mushroom sauce.  The next time that I prepare this dish, I will try it without the mushrooms and compare.REVWell, we did enjoy this but the recipe calls for salt and sherry but does not say what to do with it.  I marinated the chicken in it.  The chicken was moist and the sauce was very flavorful.  I did not use the mushrooms.  I was debating on the stars but the recipe is lacking in description.  It would have been a five star if it explained the whole recipe.  Thanks TonkcatsREVWe enjoyed this recipe.  We left out the mushrooms and did not miss them.  We will definitely make this again.  My son actually ate all of his chicken.  That is a rave review.REVI live in Montana and here they call this deepfried chicken with almond gravy...whatever you call it it''s darn good! Thank you!REVthey serve this here in neb too its one of my favorites instead of slicing almonds  chop them fine we dont have the mushrooms here');

The icing hardens more, the texture improves, the whole thing just comes together.REVMmmm these are good.  However, I''m missing the full effect because I went to make the frosting and found that I had no powdered sugar!  Argh.

This was still way too much even for cinnamon lovers like us. The apples were brown from the cinnamon rather than a nice apple color. I think if the cinnamon was reduced to teaspoons instead of tablespoons it would be a great pie but for our tastes, I think I''ll keep searching.REVI used a mix of Gala and Granny Smith, they didn''t turn out how I liked so I will have to play with the apples and see what suits my taste best, thinking Spartan might be good.   I absolutely loved the flakiness of the crust, it turned out perfect!  Spicing was done extremely well to my likings but if you aren''t big on cinnamon I would suggest adding less.  I added a bit of cinnamon sugar to the top crust before baking to add a bit more sweetness.

I used splenda instead of sugar and just used a half cup, also cut back on the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon and  used becel marg for the butter.  The pastry was fine, i used shortening, it made enough to fit easily in a 9 inch aluminum pie plate.  The only problem I had was that my apples were so juicey that when i took it out of the oven it was sitting in juice, so I quickly, while it was hot slipped it onto a plate, surprizingly it landed in one piece!!

Very good pie, we had it while it was still barely warm the some vanilla custard icecream on it, ummmmm!REVThe pie turned out really good, there was so much sauce though? Did we do something wrong?  Caution! This is an extremely sweet pie! If you don''t like sweet stuff, lower the sugar content to maybe 23 or 12 depends on you. I loved that the pie was so easy to make, the crust is perfect! will use it again in other pies. I also followed the advice of others and used less cinnamon, barely a tablespoon. We also used less lemon zest, less than 14 teaspoon because others had stated that this pie could get kind of bitter! It was perfect! We also only used five apples, they were big though! We used granny smiths and golden delicious! Perfect with a hint of tartnes and sweetness.  Can someone explain why my apple pie has so much sauce? It was overfilling and extremely sweet!REVWOW  What a great recipe. Finally  an apple pie with some flavor. I will be making this again without changing anything.REVMaybe it should be 1 12 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of Tablespoons.  If your in love with cinnamon pie with apples, this one''s for you.REVThis pie was so perfect  delicious!  The crust was the highlight.  It tasted like a sugar cookie   To make the pie less runny, I have read that you can add cornstarch.  I have also heard that it is good to stick with Granny Smith''s and Eastern Golden Delicious apples.  I took everyone''s advice and used only 112 teaspoons of cinnamon  lemon juice instead of zest.REVVery simple, I made one last night and it was tasty but too full of water.  I have another in the oven, made with a different kind of apple, hopefully it turns out less wateryjuicy.REVThis was sooo good!! I but the exact ingredients in it and it was awesome!! Best apple pie ever.  I have also never made an apple pie before.  And after reading the reviews people complained about too much cinnamon, I personally like cinnamon and I didn''t think it had too much cinnamon.  I would make this again.REVThis was a WONDERFULL pie.
Very Easy, I am nine and it STILL tasted GREAT!REVThis is the first apple pie I have ever made and it was wonderful. It will definately be my one and only apple pie recipe. No others needed.REVIt was a really good apple pie. I used 3 yellow delicious and 4 granny smiths. When i read the recipe I wondered about the cinnamon it seemed to be a lot so I used only half. I think it was just right.REVWe could not believe how wonderful this pie was. I will not have to look for another apple pie recipe again. Perfect every time no matter what apple I choose. Thank YouREVThe perfect apple pie.  I''ve made this twice now and got rave reviews both times.  The only change I made to the recipe was removing the butter since we eat kosherstyle and need dairyfree desserts.  Even without the butter this was still juicy and delicious.  I use a mandolin to slice the apples very thin which makes a nice texture inside the pie.  Thanks for such a great recipe!REVGood base, but way too much cinnamon for our taste.REVThis is the 1st time I''m making an apple pie.  Simple and easy recipe. Nutmeg and cinnamon makes it heavenly ... It was simply delicious.  

After reading the review, I decided to reduce the cinnamon and sugar by half. Skip the lemon zest. Drain the excess liquid from the ingredient after mixing them up.  

Serve the apple pie last evening at a Christmas gathering. Little did I expect it was the men who love it. One of them asked me for the recipe so that his wife could bake it for him, the other friend wanted nothing to be brought home except the apple pie... Thank you Dancer for this wonderful recipe. I''m gonna bake this for many more occasions.REVThis may be the best apple pie I have ever eaten, and certainly the best I have ever made!  I used 1 12 teaspoons of cinnamon, as I had read reviews declaring the pie toocinnamony, and I left out the lemon zest.  I have used this recipe twice, so far, one time using glutenfree flour.  My glutensensitive friend raved about it, too!REVI knew the cinnamon was going to be over the top, so i reduced it to 1.5 tsp. i also used cloves instead of the nutmeg. and at the suggestion of my son i added a bag of dried cranberries to the apples. this was such a hit that it did not last long. i plan on making it many more times in the future.REVMy first try at making apple pie. Glad I chose this recipe. For my taste, it was perfection. I used Granny Smith apples and the filling was not syrupy sweet, but just right. And the lemon really adds that something special to the flavor. Nailed it. I used premade pie dough and it worked out fine. So happy.REVExcellent recipe!!!REVMade this for 4th of July bbq party I used only 4 apples, but left the rest the same.  Made quotmini piesquot by cutting circles in the rolled out crust, and put them in a muffin tin, filled and topped with smaller circles.  Served the individual pies with a dollop of vanilla ice cream, and had rave reviews!  Many said it was the best they had tasted.  Thank you!REVWay, way WAY too much cinnamon!  112 TABLESPOONS ruined the pie  and was inedible.REVGreat pie filling. I used a different recipe for the crust. I do have to say though, i don''t like my apple pies juicy so i added a bit more flour to the filling and instead of lemon zest i just added juice from 12 a lemon. All in all great recipe.REVI cheated and used the refrigerated pie crusts, otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe.  I used fresh lemon juice and a tiny bit less cinnamon.  It was delicious.  I used Granny Smith and a couple of different red apples for my apples.  I made this for my husband''s birthday.  He was thrilled.REVVery good! I used my own crust and a couple of more apples. Only change I''d make would be to use 12 T cinnamon. I use Vietnamese cinnamon which is stronger than other types and thought that overwhelmed the pie. Not bad at all, my preference is just more apple flavor. The pie had the perfect amount of syrupy liquid. Lemon zest was a nice touch. Thanks for sharing the recipe!REVThis was yummy! I used a different crust, My No Roll Pie CrustRecipe 51537 and I made a strudel topping. Didn''t have any lemon zest, so I left it out. It turned out great!REVI have never made a pie before so I decided to go with this recipe and it turned out WONDERFUL!!! thank you for posting!!! I did cheat though and use a store bought crust so the next experiment is going to be making the crust REVOutstanding recipe  use brown sugar and it''s even bettter.  I make this and give it to friends and relatives all the time.   Soothes even the most profound bout of pathos and despair!  Better than prescription drugs, no kidding.  Just kidding, but this is really a very good recipe.REVLoved it.  A perfectly classic apple pie.  I LOVED the touch of lemon.  I did tweak it just a tiny bit.  I used a Trader Joe''s pie crust, and they suggested brushing the pie with halfandhalf not water, then sprinkling it with sugar I used Demara sugar.  It was fabulous!REVI had some old man gala apples that needed to be used up and decided to try this recipe.  Oh my!  My DH said it was the best apple pie he had ever tasted and I agree.  It was juicy and the right balance of sweet and tart.  My go to recipe now.  Thanks for sharing.REVI adore this recipe, first of all. I''ve have never made an apple pie that worked for me, the crust was always either horribly wrong or the filling would be wrong or SOMETHING would always happen and it turned out awful. THIS one, however, THIS finally made me feel awesome because it turned out AMAZING! I used our own apples we grew, they''re very, very tart and firm so they are excellent for baking. Everyone has their own tastes, and for me, this pie was not too sweet at all, but it might be because of the apples I used and because I happen to like sweet stuff. Anyway, the crust is awesome and I can believe how simple it is to make!! Tender and flaky and delicious  I did go on other reviewer''s advice in using just 1 12 TSPs of cinnamon, and it turned out fine. Love this, love this, love this! I finally have an apple pie my DH is begging me to make again! Thank you!REVTo start I should say I''ve never made a sweet pie before without using storebought crusts.  This recipe is not only easy but also delicious!  The crust is super easy to make used about 3 12tbsp of water and turned out VERY tender and flaky.  The only changes I made was to use 12c brown sugar and 12c white sugar, 13c regular shortening and 13c butter shortening not actual butter, you can find this at any grocery store.  Other than that I used just 1tbsp of cinnamon and instead of the zest I used about 1tsp of lemon juice.  Thanks a mil for this recipe, it''s a keeper .REVI was bringing the apple pie for dessert today, but the recipe wasn''t where it was supposed to beon the side of the Pillsbury ReadyCrust Box!!  But, leave it to Zaar and a great chef named Dancer to bail me out!  This was the best, the easiest.  Great recipe.  I used Cortland apples and only 1 12 TEAspoons of cinnamon.  Did use the lemon zest, but was careful not to over do.  My pie ranked right up there with the chocolate Easter Bunnies that were running amok at my daughter''s.  Thanks, Dancer, for this wonderful recipe.REVDelicious! I didn''t put the butter in the pie filling, did that by accident, but it still tasted great. This was my very first homemade pie so I was very proud to serve it to my husband and see him light up, he loves pie lolREVIt was a little too heavy on the cinnamon in our opinion, but I would make it again and just cut that back.REVThis was a wonderful pie!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I didn''t have nutmeg, so I just left it out, and it turns out, I like it even better without it!  I especially loved the lemon zest...it gave it that something extra.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe...it will be my standing apple pie recipe from now on!REVVery good pie and I will make it again!Thank you,DancerREVI used this for Thanksgiving. I would have given it five stars except that the lemon made the pie more sour than we cared for. However the other flavors were good and I''ll definitely try this one again without the lemon. I''ll also try mixing in some sweeter apples. As a new pie baker I''m never quite sure what apples would be best. Thanks a lot for an excellent recipe!REVHosted a 4H Food Project meeting at my home earlier todayfeaturing Fall Produce...and this was one of the recipes the kids made.  I can''t comment on the taste, since the girl took it home to her family, but I really WISH I could''ve tasted it...it looked beautiful we did an eggwater wash with baker''s sugar crystals on the top crust she also was tickled pink to get to use a lemon zester for the very first time in her life!!!.   The smell while it was baking was exquisite even if it did make a bit of a mess in the oven next time use some foil, Deb!.    Thank you, Dancer, for an outstanding recipe.REVThis recipe was delicious!  I made it without the lemon and it had perfect sweetness.  Thank you!REVit was amazing!!REVyummy!REVi love apple pie!! And i love this recipe!!!!  I''ve never made pie before...and this was definitely a great first try!!!!!!!REVWe really enjoyed this pie and dh especially liked the lemony bits. Thanks.REVVery good apple pie  loved the taste, I only used 1 tsp cinnamon and didn''t have any lemons rinds  I used 2 big Granny Smith apples and cut the sugar down to 34 cup  perfect for my pie pan.  Thank you for a keeper!!REVSuper cinnamony! We were running out of time, so only made the filling and used a storebought crust. Nicely filled with apples and juicy. Next time I''d try and drain the apples a bit more, since the bottom got a bit soggy. I''d definitely make it again and make the crust from scratch next time.REVThis was really good, and I am proud to say that this is the first time that my family has enjoyed my homemade apple pie. My DH would prefer a little less cinnamon next time, but that is a personal preference, and not a reflexion of the recipe. Thank you for sharing your recipe.REVThis pie was delicious and so easy to make.  I cut down the sugar slightly as I had only sweet apples available and I prefer a less sweet taste.  I will use this recipe again, thanks.REVThis was quick and easy to make.
The pastry was flaky and the filling very tasty.  If there was one thing I would change it would be that the cinnamon turned the filling brownish instead of golden yellow. I think I''ll sprinkle the cinnamon on top next time instead of mixing it in with the apples and see what happens.
Thanks for a great recipe.REVI love this apple pie recipe. This was my first attempt at baking a pie and thanks to this recipe it was a success!REVThis was a great pie.  It was nice and juicey.  The only thing I didn''t like about it was the lemon.  It was a little bit to bitter.  Thanks for posting!!   Sincerly Super SpongebobREVI can cook nearly anything but I''ve NEVER been able to make an apple pie that was juicy.  This was my first one that ever turned out and was delicious.  My husband had wanted me to buy a frozen one and I decided to try one more time.  This is definitely going to be MY pie recipe from now on.  Thanks for posting it!REVI am always trying to find a better apple pie. This one is a definite plus in my book and company enjoyed it served warm with cinnammon ice cream which I made by softening 12 gallon of vanilla and blending in cinnamon to taste. Then refreeze it and serve with pie.REVa very nice easy recipe.a recipe that has the right ingredentsREVDelicious pie! I used about 1 12 teaspoons of cinnamon which is the amount that I usually use in apple pie. My family loved it..thanks! HazeleyesREVLoved this pie!  MeganREVAs another reviewer commented, this recipe was delicious and extremely juicy. There was enough juice to drizzle over the pieces of pie even though I forgot to add butter to the filling. The apples were cooked to just the right texture  not crunchy, but not soggy, either.   I used my own crust recipe and  substituted fresh Meyer lemon juice for the rind in the filling. What made it comfort food for my family was a heaping spoonful of my grandmother''s vanilla sauce on top, which is basically the recipe on the side of the Argo Cornstarch box.  A truly delicious combination!REVWonderful pie thanks!!REVThis is the first time I''ve made an apple pie before.
Like other reviewers I cut the cinnamon down, to 2.5 tsp, I used some lemon juice not zest since we don''t care for it.  The crust came out well, but my rolling job wasn''t the best.  It smelled wonderful, next time I''m going to put sugar on the crust.  I dont know if it was the types used a variety of apples but it came out watery, maybe add more flour next time. This is good and will make it again.REVthis pie is AMAZING! Just made it for my bf as he is an apple pie fan!! he is on his third slice and jumping around the kitchen.  I added rasins, and only 34 cups of sugar and 34 tablespoons of cinnamon...YUMMY thanks Dancer!!!!!  This pie RULES! REVThe best apple pie we''ve ever had!! The only change we made was slightly cutting back the cinnamon and lemon zest. However, the lemon zest made this recipe amazing... making the flavor of the apples very complex. This will be our recipe of choice from now on. As I write this, my husband is lying on the couch, sick from eating almost 12 the pie in one sitting.. haha he said he couldn''t stop because it was so delicious. REVThis is a HUGE hit!  I used this recipe for the apple filling in several pies that I made over our Canadian Thanksgiving week and have had the recipe requested numerous times!  I adjusted the cinnamon to just 1 tbsp and didn''t have lemon zest so left it out and everything was delicious!REVTHIS WAS DELICIOUS! LOLSo easy to make and a great recipe for rookie pie makers, like myself. Thanks for posting!REVVery good pie!  I like that it is very moist and very easy to make.  There is no dimension for the pie pan provided so the apples were overflowing luckily they cooked down.REVThanks you! This is an awesome recipe! The seasoning is just perfect. I have never made an apple pie before, but I will be again. This was just delicious!Oh, and if no ice cream is handy, fine shredded colby or cheddar is yummy!REVThis is our favorite recipe for apple pie.  I usually use store bought pie crusts,I use one for the crust itself and I roll out the other one and make a lattice decoration out of it to lay across the top.  For the pie I use one extra tablespoon of flour, more cinnamon and also more nutmeg.  I also sprinkle lemon juice all over the sliced apple which makes the spices and flour and sugar stick better.  I haven''t tried the lemon zest, I figured I had enough lemon flavor with the juice.  Very easy and delicious!!REVVery easy to make. I didn''t have any nutmeg on hand so I had to omit it. Instead of regular butter I used vegan butter, which tends to be a little saltier than regular butter. I''ve also added a hand full of raisins because raisins are just awesome, and instead of 1 cup of sugar I used 12 cup of brown sugar. It came out great. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!REVI always follow a recipe exactly the first time I try it but, this time I wish I''d cut the cinnamon a bit. It''s a great pie and the cinnamon WAS a bit much....it won''t stop me from eating it though. REVThe other day, our 21 year old son, who''s never baked a pie in his life, decided it would be a good day to give it a whirl.  We came home to a house that smelled fabulous and a gorgeous looking apple pie complete with lattice top which tasted as good as it looked.  Very juicy and with a tender crust.  He wasn''t sure about the lemon zest so used a mix of lemon zest  juice.REVI thought there was way too much cinammon so I knocked it down to a tablespoon and still thought the flavor was overpowering. Didn''t have a whole lot of time so I bought refrigerated pie crust kind that''s rolled, NOT frozen Didn''t add the lemon either. Pie would have been 5 stars and EXCELLENT if it wasn''t for the mucho cinnamon taste.REVgreat combination of ingredients.  however, it was just a bit too cinnamony for me, so i plan on using a little less next time.  overall great taste!REVFantastic. I made it today and everyone like it a lot. Disappear in minutes.
The filling is like McDonalds Apple Pie!
I had reduced cinnamon and nutmeg. I''ll try next time adding some ground cardamom.
Fantastic.REVWow, this was my first time making an apple pie and it came out BEAUTIFULLY.  I am hopeless at any sort of baking to be fair, I bought the crust, but this pie was spectacular.  I used a little less cinnamon 1.5 tsp. and a little more nutmeg 0.5 tsp. The lemon zest really added something extra, I never would have thought of it.  This recipe is easy and delicious, I will definitely be making this again!REVI was looking for a relatively plain apple pie recipe and came across yours.  It was perfect for my needs. I used my easy spelt pie crust on this pie.  I used 12 cup cane sugar and 12 cup ZSweet sugar substitute.  I knew this would make the pie less sweet, but thats the way my DH likes it, and I figured low carb is better for me anyway.  I brushed the top with some Nu Laid egg replacer and sprinkled the pie with a little ZSweet to give the crust a crunch.  We ate this with a nice dollop of light whipped cream. Thanks for the tasty and simple recipe.  I will make this one again.REVDancer, I can make an apple pie!!!  I love to bake and can make just about any cake, pie, cheesecake, etc... but NEVER apple pie. They just never turn out right but this recipe is a winner.  So easy and the pie was just oozing of flavor!!  My family loved it and all gave it 5 stars.REVSmashing recipe!  The only change I made was I used a bit less than a tablespoon of cinnamon instead of the full 1.5 tablespoons.  It was a hit for Thanksgiving!  Thanks!');

Wonderful flavor and great texture!REVBest Pecan Pie ever, not to sweet and full of flavor. tried it on friends and family before the holidays and everyone loved it. amazingREVI had never made pecan pie and it was a last minute request.  I used a vanilla brandy about 5 tablespoons, light karo syrup, and extra pecans maybe a cup  I did grind up some of the pecans to thicken the sauce.  This turned out amazing  in fact the hostess hid the last piece.  Thank you so much for sharing!REVThis is the absolute easiest recipe and tastes amazing! Cover the crust w aluminum foil during the last 30 mins of cooking to prevent burning. Slices are hard to keep together after cutting but no one cares after their first bite!REVMmmmmmmmmm.  This was a hit at today''s Thanksgiving dinner!  I was so full after the feast, I hardly had room for the pie, but the flavor of the brandy with the pecans was wonderful!  I intend to enjoy another slice later this evening when I can fully enjoy it with a good cup of coffee.  I didn''t have any dark Karo on hand, so used the light.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar for my diabetic Momma.  It was still outstanding.  I even splurged and used my favorite German brandy Asbach in the recipe.  This is a definite keeper!REVMy husband''s favorite pie is pecan pie.  I''m always looking for new recipes for him to try to find a real keeper.  Well, guess what, this is the one.  He said this is the absolute best pecan pie he has ever had.  I''m very impressed with the flavor and textures.  I had no problem with the filling, it set up beautiful, and the crunchiness of the pecans was wonderful.  Thank you for sharing a family treasure, I hope you don''t mind if it becomes my family treasure too, because I don''t ever plan on making any other recipe ever again, this is the one!REVI followed the recipe to a T.  The taste was just wonderful but the pie was very difficult to cut and serve.  The top of the pie was browned and crunchy and delicious but the part between the top and the crust was quite runny.  I served this with whipped cream and I''ll make it again but, maybe, add some flour to the mixture to see if that will make it ''gel'' a bit more and make it easier to serve.REVThis was a great and easy recipe.  We used rum because we were out of brandy, but it was still wonderful!');

I lost my Camellia Grill card and I''ve been trying to find the real recipe for a while. After I moved to New Orleans their pie was worth the wait for a seat  And it was the closest pecan pie to the one my grandmother used to make. Not sure why people have mixed results  it''s like making a custard pie so timing can vary in the cooking for many reasons. Just check for doneness and give yourself an extra 30 min in case it takes longer. Plus it''s better when it is not right out of the oven. BTW at the Grill they would put it on the grill before serving to both warm it and also it makes sure there''s no soft crust. Using real butter, real vanilla extract, dark instead of light brown sugar, and free range eggs if you can find they are darker colored and add more richness. Also my grandma used half light Karo and half dark just to make it more flavorful. I grew up thinking there was a nut called quotkaroquot since she called this Karo Nut Pie! My oven is futzy so I usually put a foil rim over the exposed crust toward the end of baking time. And like others posted, personally I prefer to dump the pecans in first and pour mixture over. I am transplanted to California and I noticed the pecans we get here not local seem more dry than the ones I would buy in the south. That might cause issues if you are putting the pecans on top if they don''t have enough oil in them then they could possibly burn a bit. If that''s the case just put them in before the filling and let them rise throughout the cooking  they will be more protected and also glazed at the end.REVHi..I haven''t tried this recipe yet and I have never baked a pecan pie!!! So, I am a little concerned should it come out runny as per some comments posted. Another fellow RecipeZaar member noted in another post the following suggestion Bake at 350 for 45 to 50 minutes or until center is set. If using an electric oven you might have to add 15 to 20 minutes to the baking time. In either case, test with a toothpick after 45 minutes. This is going to be my plan, keeping my fingers crossed! I''ll let you know if this does the trick...thanks for posting.  REVFantastic pecan pie! Made it for my husbands birthday as he doesn''t like cake and requested pecan pie. I think we''ve started a new tradition! We will be using this recipe from now on. I also let the pecan float to the top so they were glazed, and had to adjust the cooking time to about 70 mins.REVDelicious flavor.  I poured the pecans in the crust then poured the filling over it.  Glazed the pecans beautifully.  The baking time in the recipe is definitely off  I baked closer to 60  70 minutes.  Thanks for posting it!REVI don''t know what I did wrong but my pie didnt set up, it has great flavor so we ate it anyway but it was more like soup with a pecan crust. My top burned some so i took it out of the oven after trying to cook it a few mins more to get it to set maybe i need to cook it at a lower temp for a longer amount of time .REVFlavor was very good, but cooking time did not set the pie.  Followed directions to the tee and it was still runny.  Made this pie twice and had to double the cooking time.REVThe cooking time seems woefully short.  I went fifty minutes, and the pie had not settled at all.  I recommend going at least 60 minutes, but probably closer to 70 minutes.REVTotally out of this world!!!  I served it at thanksgiving and the entire group thought it was the best pie ever!!!!REVSuch a simple recipe and sooooo good! I used a frozen pie crust that I had handy and it mixed up in about 5 minutes. It turned out so pretty I had to post a picture since this recipe didn''t have one yet. I will be definitely making one of these for Christmas dinner! Thanks so much for the recipe!REVIts a great recipe, super easy. I put some of the chopped on bottom of crust and put whole pecans and the rest of chopped pecans on the top. It adds a more complex nut flavor by roasting some and caramelizing the ones that rise from the bottom. For those with problems. Make sure the rack is in the center of the oven, use an oven thermometer to make sure oven is correct temp. If it is browning more on one side rotate pie. I had to cook the pie for the full time plus a few more min. Pie is done when a toothpick inserted in the pie one inch from the side comes out clean. Dark brown sugar gives a darker pie. Make sure you use karo syrup that is only corn syrup and vanilla.REVitried this for thanksgiving and was dissapointed  it came out rnny and ickyREVExcellent!!! I made this for my Grandfather for Christmas pecan pie is his favorite and my Grandmother hates it, he said it was the best pie he had ever had.  He returned the pie plate with a note that said, please refill as soon as possible.REVI must have done something wrong because the first time I made this pie it was very runny and never set up.  Tasted good though.  I made it a second time and only thing I did different I think, ha was use alot more than 1 cup of pecans and chopped them up very fine.  Came out perfect.  I will definatly make this again.REVI have made this pie twice in the last 2 days.  I used light brown sugar on the 1st and thought it looked a little funny so I used dark brown on the 2nd. I thought the dark made it look more appealing, but it tasted GREAT both ways!REVI made this and took it to Thanksgiving dinner with my husbands family. I actually do not like pecan pie, so I did not eat any, but my husband  everyone else said it was excellent, and they all wanted the recipe. I was nervous because I had never made a pecan pie before and didn''t know what it was supposed to look like or taste like, but this recipe was a success, so I will definately keep it on hand for the future. Thanks!REVI made this for Thanksgiving and it was very good. Thanks for posting.Rachel CastleREVthis pie is beautiful. thank you for posting it. And if someone is going to make it flollow the directions exactly!REVI used this recipe for my first attempt at making a pecan pie when getting together with friends for Thanksgiving.  It turned out so well and everyone liked it so much that I made it again for a family gettogether near Christmas.  All the family was very impressed with it as well.  I didn''t sprinkle my pecans on top after pouring the filling mixture into the pan, though.  I pooured the pecans into the pie shell, poured the filling in and baked.  the pecans rose to the tope and were beautifully glazed and browned.  Very Tasty!!!  I''m so glad you posted this recipe and that I found it.  It took so long for me to review it because either I didn''t save to my cookbook, or I inadvertentlly deleted it from my cookbook.  Anyway, finally found it again so I''m reviewing before I forget.REVI''ve made this recipe twice now for a friend who claims to be a Pecan Pie Snob.  He loves it and talks about it all the time.');

I''ve made Waldorf Salads before but have never added the brown sugar.  I love the way the brown sugar offset the slight lemon tang.  We used walnuts and added some dried cranberries.  Great recipe, thanks for posting.REVVery good!  I made it as written but lo and behold I was out of brown sugar!  I was so sure I had some.  I used white sugar instead and adjusted the amount by taste.  I think next time I may leave out the celery, to me it was a bit overwhelming in taste.  My husband loves apple salad  this was simple and quick.  I added a pear in with my apples and used walnuts for the nuts.REVMade this based on the ingredients I had on hand. It was a little too sweet for us and would have liked a little more celery in proportion to the apples.REVNancy, your recipe for Waldorf Salad is wonderful.  Though this is considered a typical recipe, I like the flavor.  It allows for ALL of the items to be tasted, not overwhelmed by just one flavor.  I enjoy wrapping your recipe in Leaf Lettuce and serving as a fingerfood.  Great for buffets!  Also, we love it with cashews for an extra twist.REVThe memories this brings back. As one of my mom''s favorites, I had it at least once a month growing up. 

I made it with walnuts and just as written and it''s perfect. Crunchy, sweet and delicious. Don''t change it and don''t leave anything out and it''s wonderful.REVYummy! I added a little more mayo, cinnamon and nutmeg. I also had some grapes that needed used up so I halved them and tossed them in. YUM! I served this with grilled sliced ham, made a great summer dinner. thanks for the post Nancy!REVI tried this recipe and about 4 others for Thanksgiving and I was thrilled with everyone I tried.  This one was a walk down memory lane for me cuz my Mom always made this for the holidays.REVI found it didn''t have enough flavor as written, so I added another tsp. of lemon juice, 2 tsp of honey, and some salt and black pepper. That did it. Looking at the other reviews, it seems I wasn''t alone in needing more sweetness. Good basic recipe though, and I look forward to playing with it in the future!REVSo simple and so good.  I made mine with walnuts and Miracle Whip.  We had this tonight with The Best Potato Soup Ever!  145488 and garlic cheese toast.REVYum.  I added mini marshmellows and DH and I  enjoyed it as a side with barbecue chicken. REVOK, now I know what was  missing  time.   I''d suggest giving it a few hours overnight just so the flavors do their thing.

I shared some with the neighbor because he said this was his favorite salad.   Too badnow i have to make more for me tomorrow.REVThis is the Waldorf Salad that I remember as a child, simple and flavorful. For the nuts, I added my Sweet  Spicy Glazed Nuts 57257which added a nice crunch yet the spiciness was not overpowering. I know I''ll make this one again. Thank you for sharing it.REVWaldorf has always been one of  if not the  my favorite. Over the years by experimenting I have come up with what I enjoy as the best dressing for it.

Overall, it created a very delicious white loaf, though I was using allpurpose flour, and the result was a bit heavier.

I got the tip from Alton Brown''s biscuit episode. It works wonderfully!REVBeen looking for a good biscuit recipe. Found it! Thanks, Windchime!REVAt last!  No more will I bother trying to make biscuits with biscuit mix, which turns out dry crumbly rocks.  These are so easy to put together, easy to cut out and handle, and taste amazing.  I used butter because I didn''t have any shortening on hand, and then brushed the tops with a little butter mixed with garlic powder and parmesan before baking, since I was serving them with spaghetti.  DD2 took one bite and said MMMMMMMM!!!!  Will definitely be making these again SOON!  Thanks!REVFinally found The Biscuit Recipe!!!  They look just like the picture  light, flakey, and so delicious.  I used butter and as recommended, left sit out on the counter overnight covered by a towel.  Made the mistake of rolling some of the dough too thin, from now on, will roll about 34 inch thick, because we like tall, flakey biscuits. I am going to try freezing some precut dough so I can take out a few, let thaw and then cook as needed. Hopefully that should turn out really good too.REVtried this recipe twice they were excellent ,tried freezing extra cut out dough turned out fine except they did not rise quite as high, however flavor and texture were spot on.anyone else who has tried freezing, let me know how they turned out for youREVThese are, without a doubt, the absolute best biscuits I have ever had! I don''t use shortening hydrogenated fat is evil, so I used butter. I didn''t have any buttermilk so I used kefir. After cutting out the biscuits, I cut the remaining dough scraps into 14 pieces and tossed them into a pot of chicken soup. They made excellent dumplings.REVThese biscuits do not rise at all for me! I am an accomplished baker so I know how to bake. I must be missing SOMETHING!!!REVLoved these.REVthese are the best homemade yeast biscuits that I made so far, I will make sure to keep this fantastic recipe  they are really easy and quick to make as well as sooo tasty! Thanks a lot Windchime!REVThis is one of the best biscuit recipes I have used.  I substituted butter for the shortening.  I used a half cup of milk, a half cup of half amp half, and a tablespoon of vinegar in place of buttermilk.REVDelicious, and very easy. Set the yeast to rising, and by the time I had the shortening cut in, the yeast was ready. It is a very shaggy dough, but with the addition of about 13 cup flour while kneading, it became perfectly soft and pliable. The biscuits were soft and tender. My new favorite recipe for biscuits!REVWonderful! These were easy to make and tasted great. I used butter and the milkvinegar option. I got 16 large fluffy biscuits that baked up perfectly. Thanks for sharing.REVI just made these today.........AND, I used my bread machine.  They came out perfect.......golden, fluffy and delicious.   I used half the amount of salt called for and didn039t have shortening so I used unsalted butter slightly softened......  I set the machine on the dough setting and took out at the 50 minute mark right before the second rise........rolled the dough, cut them out, let rise for 30 minutes, brushed the tops with melted butter, baked for the 12 minutes and brushed the tops with melted butter again when they came out of the oven ........DELISH!!!!!!!!!!!    Had to have one immediately with unsalted butter and marmalade!!! Yummy REVOne of the best and easiest biscuit recipes ever! The biscuits turned out so light and fluffy. Living in a high altitude, no changes had to be made. Will be my biscuit recipe from now on.REVOh my these were good! Light and incredably flavorful. Thank you so much for a great biscuit recipeREVAmazing!!! These are so good! Everyone in my family and my inlaws can''t belive I made these, since they taste better than the store bought kind. It''s now my go to recipe. I do recommend rolling these thick, so then they are bigger biscuits.REVOMG so good I can''t believe I made yeast biscuits! I should have took the pic before I ate one lol smell so good too!REVGreat recipe. My biscuits usually be hard, tasteless amp dry. These were soft, tastyamp beautifully tanned in color. Thanks. I may get married again.REVSO EASY TO VEGANIZE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used 1 cup soy milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar in lieu of the buttermilk and they were SO FLUFFY AND tasty!! Sometimes texture comes at the cost of taste, but these have BOTH the desired texture and taste. I was also making sweet potato fries so I allowed the dough to rise for about 2 hours the first time and then probably an hour after being cut. I always heat my oven to 40 degrees above the cooking temperature and then turn it to the baking temperature when I insert the baked goods because an oven will lose 3040 degrees when we open the oven. So I do not know how any of these impacted the biscuits but these knocked the socks off my family and will now be the cholesterol free family favorite!! Thanks for sharing!REVI halved the recipe easily! Really easy and great recipe!REVI love these! So easy to make and so good to eat. I make these all the time. I know it''s not heart healthy but I like to use lard when I have it. Makes them turn out just like those Grand Biscuits.REVHere I am at 4 a.m. making biscuits. I mean, did you forget that it''s Sunday or something? Come for breakfast...REVI was a little worried when these biscuits didn''t rise as much to my liking prior to baking, but they came out perfect, and the flavor was divine. So homey....so old school. Had them slathered with butter and with chicken pot pie, in the crock pot without the crust. I will definitely keep this recipe and use it often. It''s so easy, and like the other reviews, it turns out just perfect. You really must try this recipe. You won''t be disappointed.REVI made baked about 20 of these tonight and there''s only 3 left...haha! They were soo good. I didn''t have regular milk so I used Almond Milk and it worked just fine. I think next time I''ll roll them out to 1 because I rolled them to about 14 and it wasn''t that tallbig, if that makes sense. They were flatter than normal biscuits. So, I think it''d be nice to state how thick to roll out otherwise newbies such as myself won''t know otherwise. Overall, thanks for sharing the recipe. It''s fantastic! I''ll definitely be making these again.REVThese are the best yeast biscuits!  Fairly easy to make.  Messy, but they all are.  They warm up great in the oven.  They are not real bready and even warm up soft and delicious.  I cut the sugar back to 1 tbsp and they are perfect with any fillings.REVThese were almost too easy to make. The dough was very easy to work with and my family loved them. Next time I may add an extra tablespoon of sugar as we do like our biscuits a bit on the sweet side. Thanks for the recipe.REVI made these exactly as instructed, using soured milk.  Delicious light, layered biscuits!  I placed them about an inch apart on a very wellgreased cookie sheet.  Very delicious with roast, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Made about 18 biscuits, looking forward to having leftovers for breakfasts this week!  Thanks for posting!  REVFoolproof, quicky, easy, light, fluffy, tender, delicious biscuits!!! This is the best recipe we have ever tried for biscuits. Everyone loves them and I have made them twice in the past two weeks. 
I used quickrise yeast, and thus for the first rise only let them rise 10 minutes. Second rise, though, was a full 30. They bake up higher in the oven, too, due to the leavening agents. 
Buttermilk makes these the best! 
Perfect!REVExcellent biscuits! I have used them for biscuits and gravy, ham biscuits and just with jelly on them and they were great each time. I''ve tried the buttermilk and soured milk and we like them better with buttermilk. When I am making them for breakfast, I mix the dough the night before and let it sit, covered, on the counter all night. Then I can just turn it out, knead, cut and bake in the morning. Will use again and again!REVHey! These biscuits are foolproof.  We''re still eating them, three days later! Make great rolls or biscuits. Best bisquit recipe I''ve tried yet. I rolled mine a little thinner than I should have next time will make this thicker.  REVVery easy to put together and so soft and delicious. Keep in mind that they taste more like rolls than biscuits.  Keeper!!!REVThese are handsdown our favorite biscuits!! I have tried about five different recipes and was so happy when I tried this one out. Thank you so much for posting it! I think the yeast makes all the difference. Delicious with sausage gravy atop, but I mostly use them for my breakfast sausage biscuits. Oh, and they freeze wonderfully!!!REVI can''t say anything that all of the others haven''t said already  these are fantastic!  REVFantastic Biscuits!  Used this recipe to make Veggie Pizza.  Was great!  Will make this recipe again, next time AS biscuits!REVMmmm, loved them.  I used butter instead of shortening, cut the soda by half, added a tsp of honey, then dipped the biscuits in butter before putting in the pan.  I tripled the recipe for Thanksgiving.  We had 78 biscuits and 18 people, and no leftovers!REVAWESOME!

I am not a biscuit person, but was looking for something for beef stew last night 123006

They baked up in several layers of moist softness and perfect for the stew and Bfast today.

DS insisted on cutting out with cookie shapes and they HELD!

amberngriffincoREVThis recipe is one of a kind very very good!!!!!!!!!!!!REVMade these this morning, yummy yummy, I am always trying new recipes and have tried a lot of biscuit recipes.  I may not be looking any further, this is really good.  The only thing I don''t like about it is the waiting, but that''s ok.  It''s worth it.  Thanks!REVCan I possibly rate these higher than 5 stars? Made these for Easter dinner, they were SO good and SO easy. I doubled the recipe and used half white, half whole wheat flour. Made the dough the night before on advice I read in another review and rolled and baked in the morning. I can''t wait to make them again! Oh, I didn''t have shortening, so I used butter. Probably made them even yummier. Thanks for the recipe!REVThe wonderful photo caught my eye and I made these in a jiffy. I used a thinned out yogurt with water for the buttermilk. I patted in a square and cut with a pizza cutter. They rose nicely but my edges were a little mashed from the cutter. Next time I will use a proper cookiebiscuit cutter. These are a nice cross between a biscuit and a roll they look like a biscuit but have a softness like a roll and  would serve nicely as either.  Thanks Windchime, for posting.RoxygirlREVTerrific! I also used butter instead of shortening, perfect biscuits by day...garlic rolls by night! Made 14 biscuits cut with the middle cutter in the standard 3 cutter set.REVWow.  I bake all the time and have tired countless biscuit recipes.  This was wonderful.  Even better than the angel biscuit recipe I usually use.  This was a bit more time consuming than most biscuits but worth it.  The biscuits are even soft the next day.  They are more like a soft dinner rollhamburger bun in texture.  My whole family loved them.  This is a real keeper recipe.REVI just can''t say enough about this recipe.  The rollbiscuits are exceptional.  This is the first recipe that I have found that you really get that yeasty flavor of years back.  They were also very simple to make.  I may not share this one with my friends! Just in case anyone is interested, I got 16 biscuits from this recipe.REVThese biscuits were a hit. Easy, EASY, EASY, and Oh so GOOD! 
I made Chicken Ala King and served it over the biscuitsand dinner was excellent!REVJust tried this recipe after my mom mentioned her mom''s backinthedays yeast biscuits.  These are amazing!  ABSOLUTELY amazing!!  The only difference, since i was in a rush... greediness... I set the oven to 200 and let them rise in there... and I dropped tsps of dough onto a flour pile and hand rolled lightly and added to the greased pan.  This way i did not have to knead dough. YUMMY.  The consistency is like, a biscuit with a great cake texture that holds together.  Hard to explain but delicious!!!  Just wish I had someone to share this with tonight to prove how good they are.  I only wanted a pie pan full, so I halved the recipe.  So good!!REVThese are wonderful! They are so easy. I make them once a week for breakfast. I always make them the night before, letting them sit on the counter overnight. In the morning, it''s very quick and easy to finish them up. They smell wonderful and my family absolutely loves them. If there are any leftovers, they are good split with butter, sugar, and cinnamon, then bake in the oven til warm and toasted.REVThese biscuits turned out wonderfully which is a first for me.  Mine usually are flat and dry.  Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe!!!  They are easy to make also.  I might add just a tad bit more salt next time to enhance the flavor even more.REVCame out great for Easter. I''ll have to try them as ham biscuits those sound good. This is great thanks!REVSo good...sometimes I don''t even do the first rise.  I just fold them straight into biscuits and let them rise once before baking.REVcame out wonderfulthey are a cross between a soft roll and a biscuit! no leftovers at all  thanks for the great recipeREVI had never tried makin biscuits before......I found this recipe and you would never know it. Even my great aunt who makes biscuits all the time commented on how tasty they were. Thanks.REVThese biscuits are so light and fluffy.  They are so yummy.  I used 2  milk. My family loved these.  Thanks for posting this great recipe.REVI made these tonight and they were amazing!  I have been searching for a recipe like this that makes light biscuits that don''t break apart.  This is the first time I''ve made a biscuit with yeast and it was perfect.  In the past I would drive over an hour to get a biscuit like this.  Thanks for the recipe!REVGreat recipe!

Being from New Orleans, I like things SPICY! I039ve tried several other Pepper Jelly recipes and have always been disappointed because it039s always been runny and lacking in flavor even the Tabasco brand is a bit bland.

Definitely will make lots more of this while peppers are in season.REVEasy to make and tastes great!REVThis was easy and good. What more could you want. I doubled the peppers and still found the jelly to be mild enough for my friends to eat. Thank You for posting!REVFabulous!! I have made this twice this week with fresh jalapenos from the garden. It was so good the first time that I decided to make more as gifts. I used 2 packages of pectin the second time and found that it set too fast to even get in the jars. This recipe is a keeper but I will be making it with the amount of pectin called for and a few extra jalapenos.REVThis is a terrific recipe. I''ll admit I added to it a little. First off I increased the Jalapenos to a cup and added 34 cup of whole fresh frozen cranberries and the juice of one lemon with a teaspoon of zest. I chopped the cranberries up with the chili''s in the food processor. The rest of the recipe stayed the same. I did a double batch it turned out great. Everyone loves it and it is deffinately a do over. Thanks for all the hints, they did help.REVI also use two packets of pectin this stuff is awesome. We''ve used it in place of grape jelly in the standard coctail weiner recipe  cranberry jalapeno jelly, cocktail sauce and lil'' smokies. It''s super easy and always goes over very well.  Thanks for the recipe!REVHave to give this a 5 just for the easy part alone. I added 2 pouches of liquid pectin like others recommended and I added extra jalapeno''s. Oh and I also added a few drops red food coloring because the juice didn''t quite make it red enough. I used Ocean Spray cranberry juice. It looks beautiful. I maybe only used 1 extra jalapeno over half cup so I hope it tastes great as I didn''t taste test if while making it.REVBeautiful and absolutely stunning.  Yes, two packs of pectin is recommended.  My first batch I made exactly to the recipe, everyone loved it and I had to give my first batch away.  Second batch I kicked up the heat with more peppers, but that overpowered the cranberry flavor that makes this so special.  Hotter was not necessarily better.  I will stick to the original recipe but use 2 pectins.REVThis was very good jelly, the cranberry juice adds a little tang to the sweet and heat, I also added garlic. I love garlic in everything and it made it awesome good. I recommend that you use 2 pectins instead of one. It is very runny, not jelly like at all. It will be ok for marinades and mixing with things but to put on toast, crackers or cream cheese it is like water. So try this recipe it really is good just use two pectins and you will love it.REVOMG!!! TEN stars for the directions alone.  I''ve tried to make jelly numerous times with no luck  just did not set up even after weeks of sitting on the shelves.  I followed these directions to the letter right down to timing the minutes for boiling and it came out perfect.  I think the flavor will develop more bite as it sits so I''m eager to see that.  After reading other reviewers I did add some of the seeds to the mixture to get that extra bite that my family loves.  Served over cream cheese with crackers on the side and so yummy.  I''m addicted to, but think it''ll be even better with age.  If i can find some small jelly jars I think this will be perfect in my gift baskets this year.  Thinking of even putting names on the jar and using them as place cards around my Thanksgiving table.  Thanks Carole for one great jelly recipe.  Made for Tagging Pink 09REVThis is great everyone loves it!!! I''m making two more batches..I did use two packets of the liquid fruit pectin, after reading the reviews, and also used 112 cups of jalapenos and left the seeds in 10 of them, it has a bite but I think I would like it a little hotter. Thank you for sharing this recipe its greatJudyREVWow, what a great recipe.  Had been given some peppers and used them with this recipe.  The family really likes this.  I think I need to buy some more peppers and make more.  Thanks for a great new jelly.REVThis is wonderful! This recipe made 68oz jelly jars, I made 2 batches so I would have some to give as gifts.  Beautiful color!!REVFollowed directions but found there was not enough zip hot pepper flavor throughout. Was dissappointed because it sure sounded great. I think I would add alot more chopped jalapeno, 1 to 1 12 C,  next time. This was very mild jelly.REVGood stuff!! We have made several batches and I gave the recipe to my parents who love it also. I didn''t skim much before jarring, I wanted as many of the peppers in the jelly as possible. I turned the jars occassionally as they cooled to help distribute the peppers throughout the jar. What a wonderful sweethot flavor on toast! Thank you so much.REVThis is so beautiful  will be making more for gifts, and more for me!  This is actually the first jelly I''ve ever made and it came out wonderfully.  I used serrano peppers instead of jalapeno, and cranberryraspberry juice instead of just cranberry juice it''s what I had onhand, and will probably use more peppers next time.  Hoping this will become a family favorite  can''t wait ''til this Thursday Thanksgiving to share it with the kids.  Thanks!REVLooks like you may have been one of the first members on Zaar, but it seems you aren''t here anymore. Anyway this was something a little different from your ordinary hot pepper jelly. Love the colour using the cranberry juice I used cranraspberry as that was what I had. Also added a couple of cloves of garlic when I was processing the peppers, and added a couple of red chili peppers from the garden for added colour. I don''t bother putting jellies in a water bath and they sealed just fine. Just remember to rotate the jars as they''re cooling to distribute the solids. A lovely addition to my store of preserves thanks!REVThis is a great recipe.  Nice colour and flavour.  I added extra jalepenos to give it a little more kick.REVThis is my favorite hot pepper jelly! so far

I add 3 habeneros to heat it up to where I like it.  I''ve used Ocean Spray cranberry juice cocktail a couple times and don''t get as nice a color as when I''ve used store brand juice.  It hasn''t affected the taste at all, the color is just more of a honey color.  The brighter color of the store brand juice looks better for a gift.  Someone comment if they''ve noticed this.REVJust made this used jalapinos habeneroand 1 tiny sliver of cal.reaper! Daring! Is wonderful! Spicey yet sweet! Set perfectly! Thanks so much! Will use this recipe often! Great gifts!REVThis is my favorite pepper jelly recipe so far  even my 80 year old friend who judges jam at the county fair said she couldn''t stop eating it!  I might add a bit more peppers next time.  I used the store brand cranberry juice after reading the reviews, and the color is like a blush champagne.Very elegant  I can''t wait to use up all my peppers making this for gifts! Thanks so much for the recipe.REVMy sister and I are boiling our jars now but had to try the extra with cream cheese.  It is fantastic.  I''m going to go out and pick more peppers now.REVThis is a great recipe, love the color and taste.  I added more peppers and some garlic after the first batchit was a little mild for my taste. Turned out great and I am planning on sharing this recipe with a great many others!!!');

The potatoes are a mystery.  I am a relatively new cook anf I followed the instructions exactly.

Iused boneless skinless chicken breasts 10 in a double recipe and they baked in about 20 minutes.  I had problems with the potatoes as well.  I did microwave the mixture to start it and basted them every 10 mins or so.  They should have been covered the whole time and cooked in a single layer so they would get more coverage from the liquid.  Using new potatoes cut in half they took around 15 mins. in the oven after 10 in the microwave.  We loved the flavor, using the juice from the potatoes over the top.

I also had an 8oz. carton of soymilk that was about to expire, so I used that instead of the water, and cut back a bit on the oil.

I like yours better, and going to suprise my daughter when she gets home. Thank You.REVA friend gave me this recipe back around 1990 and my younger son loved it so much, when he was in 3rd grade, he requested that I make it into cupcakes to bring for his birthday treat for his class. His classmates came up to me a few days later when I was there to help with something and told me how much they loved it. One even asked for the recipe for her mom. I''m here today because that son is about to have his 30th birthday and I needed to find a copy of the recipe. So glad it''s here and looks exactly like I remember it. Side note thoughI tried to decorate the cake a little for his birthday one year. I tinted the glaze with blue food coloring. Big mistake! Blue food coloring on a yellow cake looks green. My poor cake looked like it had mold growing all over it. lol Still tasted good though!REVGreat GO TO recipe. A kitchen standard in the home I grew up in, food memories. My Mom would sometimes just dust generously with powdered sugar to save time. Just the recipe I was looking for, Thanks.REVMy Mother made a Jello cake for my grandfather all she would do is us a box cake and bake it like the box said then when the cake was cooled she would make up a box of Jello and and then mother would get a wooden spoon she would use the handle and make holes all over the cake and then mother would pure the Jello in the holes and when it was dune mother would put it in the Fridge for 1 hour and it was realy  good. hope someone makes this.REVYum Yum.  Very moist and flavorful.  I substituted fresh squeezed lemon juice for the water in the recipe just cuz I love lemons that much!  Turned out fantastic.REVI have made this twice now. Once with the lemon jello as I had an extra packet from bought for an earlier recipe and once with orange jello for my son''s birthday and both were excellent. Made the yellow cake from scratch we are not that big on box mixes in India D Topped with the jello and the lemon glaze for the lemon cake  and with whipped cream and orange slices for the orange cake.

It has now become my family''s favorite!REVThere were two recipes that I received in the late fifties or 60''s.  They were so great then.  The other recipe was Orange Jello Cake, using Orange Jello with White Cake Mix.  They were fast, simple, moist, and rated excellent then.
My recipes are packed for moving so I cannot give you the baking temperature or time.REVLike the Vanden Brinks this is a handeddown recipe in our family, and it has remained a favorite over the years.
We are all for making things easy and we are very satisfied using Duncan Hines Supreme Lemon Cake Mix, and we cook it at 350F for 2530 minutes, using the toothpick caper. We frost it with juice and zest of one lemon, and 1 cup powdered sugar  more if needed. Puncture the cake many time and pour over cake. Place under broiler watching carefully until sugar melts and looks wet.REVThis is the best cake ever, I got the recipe from a friend many years ago, but instead of using Lemon Cake mix, we use Strawberry with the Strawberry Jello or one of its variations strawberry kiwi, or something, I use frozen strawberries to decorate the top and add a little strawberry juice to the lemon juice and pwd sugar icing.  My stepdaughter wants this as her birthday cake, it is her favorite.  I want to try this as cupcakes, but haven''t yet, wish me luck.REVlove this recipe! my grandma makes the same one and we mix first 4 ingrediants for 3 minutes then add the oil and mix for another 3 minutes. it makes a very fluffy moist  cake!  also the temp. for the oven is 350 degrees.LOVE THIS CAKE!REVVery nice! my 6 year old daughter really liked it.

They were very good and lemony!  Thank you for this great recipe.REVMy daughter made this for her grandma''s birthday, who happens to love lemon.

Thanks for postingI''ll be making these again soon!REVThese are thick, soft cookies. I was surprised there was no baking soda in them but they didn''t need it. The eggs were obviously enough to make them puff up beautifully. One of my complaints is, they were too salty. I would definitely recommend cutting that back to 12 tsp. like a traditional chocolatechipcookie recipe calls for. Apart for the saltiness, I also found the flavor a little ''bland''.

I think with some minor adjustments, this good recipe could be a great recipe.REVFollowed recipe verbatim.  Cookies came out leaden  perhaps because of all the brown sugar and no leavening agent.

I didn''t add cilantro find it vile. or the black olives also vile. and instead of the tomato and salsa, I added 2 tbsp of tomatoes with green chilies which gave it a nice heat.  Very tasty, and it yields quite a bit nice to stretch out those expensive avocados. Thank you!REVGood basic dip.  Followed the directions, except for the black olives and lemon juice.  Test tasted it and found that the flavor needed to be kicked up a few notches.  I added some chili powder, more onions and tomatoes and more sour cream to give a creamer texture.  I also added some salt.  The flavors really need to blend and the best way to keep the guacamole from turning brown is to add the pit into the dip. You won''t need to add the lemon juice or lime juice if you add the pit and then remove it before serving.REVgreat recipe free form is the best when it comes to guacamole!

I didn''t have olives but added salsa verde.  Great with our Mexican Cobb Salad.REVDidn''t make this exactly as written  freeform and all.  It seemed to be a little bland as we made it, but as the avocados we had the great big huge ones pretty tasteless, so that probably didn''t help.  Next time we''ll use a different kind.  I don''t care for black olives, so skipped that  but might use green next time.  We used some fresh pico de gallo that we''d made, which was nice.  Also will definitely use some extra garlic.  The sour cream adds a different dimension to it  great for a spread on BLTs or for homemade chips.  Thanks!REVabsolutely delish. love the addition of black olives. i add a touch of sweet chili sauce too, the second time i made this. so versatile!REVTerrific Dh and I are loving it.  I left out the salsa and olives.  I used white onion.  I used lemon juice and 12 tsp. of salt .  YUM!REVI loved the sour cream.  I followed the chef''s advice and let my guacamole be freeform.

Made it last night with hubby. I love the addition of the sour cream.  We were a little bit more generous with the tomatoe, onion and salsa... it''s very hard to do just 1Tablespoon of those items.

Hubby added a couple dashes of Old Bay and it was tasty!REVmade this heaps of times, keep forgetting to review! here it is, a review! its brilliant, try it!REVThis is fantastic! I would have never thought to add black olives to guacamole, but it really gives it pizazz. The only thing I changed was to substitute sour cream with plain nonfat yogurt for a healthier option.    I also used both lime and lemon juice instead of one or the other.REVI''m not a fan of guac, but my BF is and he really raved about this guacamole.  I omitted the sour cream.  Glad to know that whenever I have some extra avocado this recipe can put it to good use.  UPDATE I am converted.  I love this stuff and it is a must whenever we have tacos.  The canned guac they serve at restaurants is toxic waste by comparison.REVWonderful!! I made ours without the onion and olives bcuz we don''t like that here. But it was EXCELLENT!

I omitted the cilantro because there are many of my guests that feel it is vile, and I omitted the olives, because I think that might be weird in a guacamole. Otherwise...very tasty.

This is a keeper here! VERY easy  delicious!!
Didnt have cilantroparsley but its turned out just fine! REVOh, this was so good!!!  Even my husband liked it and he is not usually a fan of guacamole.

I used a food processor and  just tossed everything in and gave it a whirl.  Turned out great!  PamREVThis was my first time making guacamole.  This is an excellent recipe  very quick and easy to make.  The only change I would make next time is to leave out the sour cream.  I like my guacamole a little less creamy.

This is my kind of recipe. I love it, versatile, yet delicious and easy to prepare.

I''ll be experimenting with it constantly to suit my daily tastebuds.REVDH made this recipe for our Super Bowl snack.  Delicious!!  It would be great at a barbecue, Mexican night, or just about any time.  I''m glad we finally discovered this recipe!  Thank you, maenadREVThis was also my first attempt at guacamole and it was wonderful.  I put my through my food processor to where it was just chunky.  DH said it was better than any restaurant guacamole he''d ever had.  I''ll be sure to add this to my list of great recipes.REVThis was very good. It had a nice texture, and color the only thing for me I felt it needed a bit of freshly ground pepper to bring out the avocado more. After tasting for myself..I added a little hot sauce only because I like my guacamole a little spicy..but this is a good guacamole that will blend well with Mexican meals because it isn''t overpowering like some I have tried before. Thanks for sharing. glitterREVThank you for sharing this!  I made it tonight, my first time making guacamole, in fact, I have never had an avacado in my house! 
I omitted the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and olives, only due to the fact that I was out., although I did add some onion powder. Very yummy!!REVExcellent guacamole! Good color and flavor, a favorite!
REVI made this to serve with some Burritos I was making, I used Haas avocados, and added the sour cream, salsa, cilantro, red onion, garlic and lime juice. I also added a shake of Mexican Seasoning.
Love the texture of this Guacamole, thanks for posting.REVThis is a great recipe, perfect for those really hot days when you don''t want to heat up the house cooking  with the stove. I used yogourt instead of sour cream. It is very good to bring on picnics.REVLoved this recipe!  I used cilantro and lime juice and left out the olives.  I used about 12 tsp salt for one avocado.  The flavor was perfect with our fajitas.  Thanks!REVWonderful guacamole recipe.  I didn''t have any black olives or salsa, so I added a few extra tomatoes and some finechopped bell peppers instead.  Delicious!REVVery good recipe if you prefer creamy guacamole.  I would halve the amount of sour cream next time.  I didn''t add olives or tomatoes to mine.  REVI loved how easy this recipe was.
REVReally enjoyed this recipe. It went over very well at the Christmas Party. ThanksREVloved it ... yummy!! It''s a good thing that we had guests over to share it with us or else me and the hubby would have eaten all of it!!!  MMMMMMMMMREVThis was the best guacamole we''ve ever had!  Thank you for the recipe  we''ll be making it again and again!REVI used this recipe last night but felt it needed something so I added a little sugar and chili powder and its great now!  I also added medium salsa which kicked it up a notch!!!  I did not add the black olives though.REVReally enjoyed this. Very quick, very simple. I used some red pesto instead of salsa and creme fraiche instead of our cream. Turned out really nice. Black olives are definitely essential to the taste.Had it with spicy home made sweet potato wedges and some Baklava Salmon salmon with honey, mustard and walnutsReally went down a treat REVThis recipe was easy to do.  5 stars might be a bit much, maybe 412 would be better.  It lacked a bit of flavor for me.  I''m used to a guacamole with zest.  I didn''t use the olives, but did use fresh lime.  I will keep this recipe for the basics, but think next time to use a spicy salsa to kick it up.REVThis was very tasty but we added a few drops of Chilli oil to give it a bit of a kick.REVThanks! Great recipe. Very yummy!REVOh my goodness!!! This is by far the best Guacamole I have ever eaten in my life. I quadrupuled the recipe and am glad that I did because one would just not have been enough know my bottomless pit of a stomach.  Thank you sooo much for this wonderful recipe. It doesn''t get much better then that.REVThis is GREAT!  I love it and make it often!  I have always stayed away from guacamole, I though that it would be nasty bc of the color.  Boy was I wrong!  My very pregnant sister in law craves this, so I made her some for her baby shower.  It was a hit, I had to run to the store when it was over to make some more for her to bring home.  My batch was adjusted to serve 12 people and it still was the first thing to go.  Thanks a lot!REVExcellent!  The only way I make guac now!REVI love this recipe!!! I have made it 2x in one week. I left out parsley and didnt have olives, but other than that I followed recipe exactly. My picky 2yr old and mother who hates quacamole ate it all up. Thanks for a great recipe!REVYUM!!! Thank you for sharing this simply, yet delicious recipe. 

My son, who unlike my other 3 kids usually thoroughly dislikes avocado, ate this without a second thought and even asked if he can help make it next time.REVMade this with Nimrod Cook''s Mexican Snack Stacks 182091. This very easy. I omitted the cilantro. I didn''t have any, otherwise I follow the recipe to a T. I also used lemon juice. Thanks maenad for sharing you recipe.REVExcellent recipe, easy, quick and very versatile, not to mention very tasty! Can be made vegan by taking out the sour cream.REVThis was a delicious guacamole recipe.  I used my blender to help mush up the avocado and sour cream together, then placed in a bowl with the diced avocado and folded in the rest of the ingredients with a rubber spatula.  
I served this with Mini Tacos a href74301Mini Tacosa and we ate every drop!  Thanks for the easy recipe.REVI have made this a few times and always get great reviews. My avocado picking skills need some honing though I omit the black olives, and instead of the fresh tomatoes, I just add another tablespoon of Salsa. This recipe definately makes me look like a great cook thanks!!REVThis is a good, easy recipe, and I''ve made it several times. I did leave out the olives, but made everything else the same and got a guacamole that was praised by all that tried it.REVloved it the way it was. wish i could store it in the refridgerator, but it just turns bad on me. oh wellREVThis is a very good recipe. I know it can be flexible, but I always stick to all of the ingredients and the measurements. Thanks. REVThis was an awesome recipe!! I love guacamole but this recipe was better than any I had had before.  Be sure, I will be making this one from now on!!REVJust a tip I saw on T.V., to be sure that you get a nice green avacado, peek under that little stem.. if it''s bright green, the avacado is good.. if its black, then the avacado will have black spots inside. 
  My guacamole is made almost exactly like yours, minus the olives, so I''m sure that it''s great!');

I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used store bought UNseasoned bread crumbs instead. My Husband loved it and so did I! A nice change from the lemon I usually put in my baked fish.  I also seasoned the the breadcrumbs with approx. I tsp kosher salt  fresh ground pepper, and browned the mixture before spreading on the fish. another poster had mistakenly added the juice to the bread crumbs, and I would like to  stress the part of the recipe that says POUR JUICE OVER THE FISH AFTER THE BREADCRUMBS .  What a nice  different surprise this dish was!! Will make again  againREVNice different flavor.  Will use again as a change of pace to lemon!REVI cannot award stars as I am not sure what went wrong.  I used frozen sole and I think it had a slight after taste that sometimes frozen fish has. I cut the recipe back to two servings. When the crumbs were mixed with the butter and orange juice they were clumped together I did measure when I cut back the recipe i could not sprinkle them I had to spread them with a knife. I love garlic but did not care for the combination with the orange for the sole.  This recipe has received two 5 star reviews so I suspect the problem is not with the recipe but rather this cook. and the chosen fish. Sorry Doreen the recipe did not work for me.REVChris and I REALLY loved this recipe. We used the zest of the whole orange, and it wasn''t at all overpowering...in fact, it was very subtle, and didn''t take away from the true flavor of the fish. Each bite would have these little bursts of orange flavor from the zest, and it was just wonderful!!! We used tilapia filets, and followed the recipe as written. This was incredibly quick and easy to prepare, and baked in 20 minutes. We had this with steamed broccoli and rice, and we couldn''t be more pleased...thank you so much for this delicious recipe..we''ll be making it many times in the futurethis is definitely a 5 star keeper!

definetly a keeper.REVi like this soup when i have everything at homeREVVery good. I added a few other spices including red pepper flakes and worcestershire. We ate it with nacho chips. Next time I might try to add a little vinegar and sugar or a packet of taco seasonings. I might also thin it out a little by using less hamburger or more juice. Thanks!REVI thought this was excellent! I used Spicy V8, and that is what did the trick for me. By not using lowsodium V8, this is a kind of high in salt recipe, but soooo gooood.

Also a new comfort food for me as if I needed yet another!    Thanks for sharing this recipe!REVVery good quick soup.
I added fresh squash and mixed vegies for a little more depth.REVThis was very good.  Quick and easy to make.  The DH loved it and so did the little ones.  Will definitely be making this again.REVI was wanting something quick and easy for Christmas lunch.  I decided on this soup as I wanted to use up some ingredients in my cupboard and fridge.  I did add more celery, carrots and added some mushrooms and 12 cup lentils.  By this time, it was so thick, I did not add the potatoes.  I added 1 chicken cube and about 2 cups of water, to thin it out.  I was really pleased with the results.  I highly recommend this recipeREVI chose to spice this soup up with cayenne, a little montreal steak seasoning, chili powder and crushed chili peppers. Couple of changes added a cup of chicken broth and only used 2 med potatoes which I thought was plenty.  And, after hearing this would be good with mushrooms 200 times with other recipes, I automatically included them for my husband  some quartered, some sliced. Cheese is a good topping and I bet sour cream, bacon and green onions would be too. I will definitely be making this again.REVExcellent!  I served it with freshbaked French bread. . .yum.  The only thing I would change next time is carnivore that I am I''d probably double the amount of meat.

This is a recipe I''ve tried to find for years  thanks for sharing!REVMade this for dinner last night,  and well . . I had to jazz the flavor up a bit.  It was a little too bland for my family, so I added to already inclusive 46 ounce V8 juice two cups of Spicy Hot V8, two T. of Pickapeppa sauce and 12 cup quick pearl barley.  Next time, I will add an extra 12 lb. of hamburger, and 4 potatoes instead of three.  I had made some classic white bread in the bread machine, served it with this soup, and man o''man, was it ever good!!

It was a great supper, and I''ll definitely make it again!  Thanks, Bob Ross!!  REVExcellent, easy soup!REVMy husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  It was very good.REVI made this soup and Brenda''s Homemade Bread today for dinner. Both were great. I used homemade tomato juice and it was too tart for my taste so I added a can of tomato soup plus a can of water. That toned down the tartness, but, now it had too much tomato taste. So I added a can of chicken broth. I also put a big clove of garlic through a garlic press and added that too. That did the trick for me. I simmered it for about two and a half hours because I wanted it thicker. Today was a very cold day and it hit the spot.REVGood one even for cold nights in Toronto.REVThis is a very nice, simple soup.  I only put onethird the amount of tomato juice called for, and substituted water for the remaining liquid.  Also, I used veggie crumbles instead of hamburger meat because we try to eat mostly vegetarian meals.REVThis was great.

Also used 1 C white and 1 12 C whole wheat.  I used the electric mixer to mix the first 6 ingredients.  Left out the cinnamon.  I frosted with Recipe 310966 and the whole family almost devoured it in one night! Thanks!REVi was also going to submit this old favorite recipe of mine!  i''ve always called it zucchini chocolate chip cake and love having people try it, then later telling them there is zucchini in it.  i''ve made this recipe for 38 years now and it''s even better the next day, but it rarely lasts that long.  the only difference is that this recipe calls for sour milk and my recipe calls for buttermilk.  one measurement is different in that my recipe says to measure the 2 12 cups of flour, then take out 2 12 tablespoons a strange instruction i''ve always thought.  otherwise, it''s all the same.  yes, it''s great to use those garden zukes up which is why i have it cooking right now in my oven.REVThis is the best!  It was gone the same day I made it!  I can understand why it won a blue ribbon!REVI was going add this recipe but did a search first to make sure I wasn''t adding a duplicate.

Wonderful cake I highly recommend!REVThis was such a wonderful way to use the very last zucchini from my yard.  I took Keolani''s advice and baked it in a 9x13 pan at 350 for 40 minutes.  Next time, I will start checking it at 30 minutes.  ha ha, I was watching Law  Order SVU.  I used buttermilk and stirred the chocolate chips into the batter.  It was so moist!  Zucchini bread usually gives me heartburn.  This goes down smooth.....gotta be the chocolate!  I bet you could even make  wonderful cupcakes from this batter!  Dave, your recipe is a keeper, thanks for posting!REVThis is the one I was going to post.  Yummy, moist.  My boy would have eaten the whole pan which would have been all his vegetables for the week.  I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 4555 min.  It''s also good with chopped nuts sprinkled on top.REVI have a garden that is going crazy producing zucchini by the truck loads. In the search to find a recipe new and different I stumbled onto this one. It is absolutely wonderful and moist! Since I had no chocolate chips I found the cake needed to be a bit more chocolatey....so I used 6 tablespoons of baking cocoa rather than 4. I highly recommend this chocolate treat!REVI was going to add this recipe, and found it was already here. We LOVE this in our family. We add 12 tsp cloves as well.REVThis is a great cake!!

I used a white whine didn''t have Sherry.REVI haven''t finished cooking this one, but the aroma alone is soooo yummy that I know that it''ll be fantastic!REVThis was my first Roast I''m learning how to cook!. I made it in a crockpot and did not use the Marjoram or Rosemary becuse I didn''t have any. MY DH loved it and that says alot becuse he is picky. Super easy recipe for first timers!REVAbsolutely delicious and great for the whole family! The meat was soo tender and the gravy was seasoned to perfection. I followed the recipe except for three tasty diversions1. Used beef stew meat cubed2. Whole peeled pearl onions  a shallot instead of 2 c onion, and3. Mashed potatoes for starch instead of egg noodles. Everyone said to double the gravy, so I did, and the extra liquid helped carry it through the two hour cook time nicely. Also, made enough gravy for the potatoes. Idea! Try adding baby potatoes and carrots to the beef  onions to make a savory stew.REVA great way to fix pot roast!   The gravy was everything you said it was.   I added about 12 of a 14 oz can of beef broth to give it more liquid to simmer in.  this made plenty of broth for gravy.  We''ll be making this again.REVWOW! This is the first time I''ve ever made pot roast, and I am glad to have found this recipe. I followed the instructions precisely and it was great!   I served this with egg noodles, and corn on the side.  Even the kids loved it. Thank you for sharing.  This one will be added on our biweekly plan.REVOMG! This was awesome! I made baked potatoes to go with it and we ended up putting the gravy on the potatoes too. Which was even more awesome. This is my new pot roast recipe.REVGreat recipe! DH loved it and he''s a picky bird. I cooked it in a crock pot 4 hours on high, using a chuck roast cheap!. Yum, thanx for posting.REVThis was outstanding!

Very delicious, tender and succulent!!  the sauce was the best we''ve had in a long time, really outstanding!! I think the sherry really tipped the scales toward fabulous, thanks for posting a real keeper I will be making again. Can hardly wait for the leftovers tomorrow, I will add some veggies and potatoes and the sauce of course to make a casserole and we will enjoy it all over again!!REVI''m not a mushroom lover, but this looks very, very good.REVThis really is an incredible tasting roast.  The gravy is really incredible, and like another person posted doubling the gravy is recommended.  The gravy is a HUGE hit!  Next time I would use the smallest mushrooms I could find, or add a few more, but we''re mushroom fiends.  I did do a variation though.  We just bought some fresh sourdough bread, so I made it open face sandwich style.  The sourdough went great with the gravy.REVMade the roast exactly as recipe states, except doubled the ingredients for the gravy.  The gravy is very tasty and the meat nice and tender, however, the gravy was too sweet for our tastes.  I should have realized that when adding the ketchup and sherry.  I would still recommend this recipe.REVThis was the best roast I have ever eaten. The gravy was beyond compare. I added a pinch of salt and doubled the gravy. Good thing I did the family couldnt get enought of it.REVAbsolutely delicious! I used sliced mushrooms and didn''t bother to thicken the gravy, it was more of a thick mushroomonion sauce that was wonderful served over the roast. Tender, flavorful and easy. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!REVWe LOVED this. I was worried about it being too sweet so I added 2 Cups of Beef Broth while it cooked.  Amazing REVI got this recipe out of one of my junior league cookbooks and I am so glad to see it posted here.  The flavor of the pot roast is just wonderful!  I used a boneless chuck roast.  I didn''t thicken up the gravy as it was plenty thick on its own.  The recipe is easy to make and one that I will be making often.  Thanks for posting!REVThis was very tasty.  My hubby loved it!  I cheated and used a packet of dried onion soup instead of the fresh onions.  I omited the ketchup and used white wine since I didn''t have any sherry.  Delicious gravy! I made this in my crockpot and added a few peeled carrots toward the end.  I served it over mashed potatoes. Thank you, Julesong, for a great dinner!');

The grapenuts make the whole cookie heartier than a plain oatmeal.  You will love these!REVI''ve made these before and just made them again.  These cookies have a fantastic texture as they are soft, chewy, and crunchy all at the same time.   I threw in half a bag of white chocolate chips this time, it really improved the cookie.  Plus the red and white really look nice if you are making these for Christmas. I love that this recipe makes tons of cookies I even made my pretty big and I still got 50 cookies!REVMy husband will not eat anythign but choc. chip cookies so I traded the cranberries for mini chips.  He Loved them!! Said they were award winning!REVwe weren''''t crazy about this recipe.  The cookies taste okay, but the texture of the grapenuts was what we didn''t like.  It is like having eggshells or nut shells in your cookies.  The grapenuts stay very hard and it isn''t pleasant to bite into them.REVThese were just what I was looking for! I made it even easier by doing it in a food processor. Added all wet and sugars together until creamy, then added flour mix and pulsed until mixed.

I don039t know if I039ve lost track in counting out my oatmeal, or what, but I039m always adding another 13 cup quick oats.  I get abut 42 cookies, 16 rouned teaspoons per baking sheet on which they don039t melt together as they bake.  So I039m feeling like I have the right amount per spoonful fort he size of cookie I want.  I do add 2 more min. to the baking time, however.  After cooling slightly, they do come off the sheet easily.REVI am so pleased with the way these came out! I used aquafaba in place of the egg and it worked out great! They smell delicious too.

Thanks for a great recipe ReeLani.REVThese are the best oatmeal cookies ever.  I added some chocolate chips and baked them 1 minute longer.  The base is almost toffee tasting and could almost fool you into thinking there were toffee bits mixed in because of the grape nuts.  Well done!!REVYum! To echo previous reviews, these are truly excellent. DH and I agree that this one is a keeper. I did, however, change them quite a bit. In fact, I think I may post my version because it is a little bit more healthconscious not that these are bad to begin with!. Thanks for the great recipe!REVThese were really good!  I''ll probably make them again.  I did only use 1 cup of butter and they turned out wonderfully.  I also added 34 cup white chocolate chips, and I highly recommend doing that.  I tried doing some of the batter without cranberries and with chocolate chips instead, but I didn''t like that taste combination.REVI love the crunch of these cookies!  I had to make 4 dozen cookies for the school''s cookie exchange and I had been wanting to make these for a while.  I used 3 sticks of butter instead of margarine.

Tastes just like Outback''s!REVWhile this was quite tasty it is nothing like the French Onion soup that is served at Outback! It is more like a creamy potato soup of sorts!REVTwo words TOO SALTY! Other than that, this recipe was the closest recipe I''ve seen to the actual soup. The first time I made it, I did exactly what the recipe said. It was way too salty for my boyfriend and my taste and had too many onions. The second time around, I added less than one tsp of the chicken bubillion and no salt until after I had tasted the final product. I''m not a big onion fan, but I do appreciate the flavor they can give a dish. I chopped up only about a 1412 a cup of onion and that was muuuch better. Also, I boiled some bite sized pieces of potato and threw those in too because the Outback in my area has potatoes in there. brbrOverall, the recipe was great and I will definitely be using it for years REVThis is unbelievable!!!!!! Velveeta is the key!! Thank you!!!REVI have never made a creamy onion soup, but I thoroughly enjoyed this Outback Creamy Soup.brThe flavor of the soup was delightful.  The only thing I found, was it was just a bit too thick for my liking, so added and additional cup of chicken broth.brThe Velveeta cheese really made a big difference.brThank you for sharing this recipe with us.brRegards,brUncle BillREVCan make the white sauce in a large pyrex measuring cup in the microwave.  It will thicken faster that way and you don''t have to worry about it sticking.  You do need to make sure it doesn''t boil over though.  Will make the recipe even easier!REVWe order this every time we go to Outback if it''s available. Since we have to drive at least 1 12 hours to the nearest Outback we don''t get there too often so I was very happy to find this recipe. I recently fixed it for my wife''s family and we all agree that it tastes exactly like the original. The only thing I did different was to let it cook at least an hour longer on low heat. Also, I don''t really think it''s possible to use too many onions since they cook into the soup. I use about 45 medium sized onions for this recipe. The sad thing is it''s always gone by the end of the day.REVThis soup was awesome!!!! I doubled the recipe and it was perfect. My husband loved it too!! I added some cornstarch mixed with a little bit of water at the end because it wasn''t as thick as I''m use to at Outback, but a delicious soup.REVWarming rich  delicious on a cold night.

Thanks for posting!!REVI don039t know what I did wrong but my soup didn039t turn out looking very good.The milk in the white sauce curdled after putting on warm for 30 minutes. The flour for the white sauce got lumpy but the taste was really good. I refuse to let this great tasting soup defeat me so I made it again the next night and I think I conquered it.  LOL! This time I used cornstarch in the white sauce like I usually do when I make a white sauce. Yea no lumps!  Great tasting soup. Maybe next time I will add a little white cooking wine to the soup as it cooks.Thanks Molly for posting. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet SoupREVVery tasty, although I don039t know how much I can compare to Outback039s version, which blew me away first taste.  Great recipe, and i never, ever made soup from scratch before.  However, feel I must have done something wrong  maybe too much milk, because I had to add more pepper and cheese to boost flavor.  Didn039t use the bouillon cubes, and maybe that039s it.  Next time, I will try to prepare exactly to directions.  Even still, it039s a flavorful soup that039s very satisfying.  Also, threw some frozen corn in the microwave and added to mixture.  Yum.REVThis recipe was pretty good except I think it called for too much salt. The velveeta cheese is salty enough. But pretty darn close to the actual soup! I ended up adding mkre milk because it was way too salty for me and a little too thick.REVJust wondering how do you get the nice brown top on the soup like on the picture as the recipe doesn039t say to place in the oven to brown. If you do what temp. And For How long.REVGreat recipe. Husband said better than Outback. Did make one addition. I added 14 packet peppered gravy mix blended with some cold milk, as seemed like it would be right. Soup was perfect. Will def make again.REVCan not say enough about this soup. Doubled up on everything in the recipe and followed to a T. Awesome! Just as good if not better than Outback''s. Thank You!REVRE The White Sauce. You do NOT need to do anything special with the quotwhite saucequot  I know the other recipes you find on YouTube go into some detail about thickening the white sauce in another pot, but you DONquotT need to. I just put all the white sauce ingredients in a blender flour, butter, whole milk and blend until it is totally incorporated and actually foamy. This method completely eliminates the quotchunkyquot uneven mix you get if the white sauce doesn''t like the temperature of the chicken broth. Try it, it''ll save you some time and cleanup.REVThis soup is so awesome. I followed directions to a t but think next time I am going to use a little less butter. I will be making this alot as I love creamy soups. This one was an A.REVVery tasty soup!  I''ve never had this at Outback but am sooo glad I found it here.  I lightened it up by using 1 milk and just two slices of Velveeta and a slice of butter cheese.  I didn''t add salt and didn''t miss it.  I''ll make this again and again!REVI have not had the Walkabout soup in years so I can''t really state how close it is.  However, as a creamy onion soup, it is very good.brbrI followed the directions with three minor changes.  Normally I advocate following the recipe exactly as it is or else I don''t review it but these were small changes.  I omitted the first 14 teaspoon of salt, used Knorr reduced stock 1 tub in place of the bouillon and used Velveeta Queso Blanco rather than regular.  Those substitutions were due to what I had on hand.brbrThe directions were very clear and I ended up with a creamy, oniony soup that was delicious just as it was and I''m sure I will make it again.  brbrIf I were to serve it as a main dish for more than just myself, I would serve it with bowls of croutons, cooked potato cubes, diced ham, cooked corn, shredded cheese, etc...  so that people could dress it up themselves.  But as a starter, it would be great as it is.REVThis is EXACTLY the soup the Outback used to serve.  Be careful with the salt, though.  Because of the broth and bullion, you''ll want to taste it before adding more salt.REVI reduced the salt by using fewer bouillon cubes and not adding the salt.  I also reduced the liquid a bit to make a slightly thicker soup.  The taste was amazing and will definitely be something I make again. Thanks for a great recipe!REVI used stephtrosclair''s tip and used evaporated milk. I threw in three thin slices of american cheese in addition to the Velveeta. and steemed three ears of fresh sweetcorn, sliced off the kernels, and threw them in too. It was increadible. My new favorite soup. I guess, technically, it has become a chowder.REVMy husband and I love this soup!  I haven''t had it at Outback  but I would now after making it at home!  This recipe has been given to a few friends also.REVMolly, what a fantastic soup! I made this for dinner tonight for DH and DS, they both raved over it. I doubled the recipe, used homemade chicken broth, and only used 3 cups onions instead of 4 cups. I did not double the white sauce, only the soup ingredients. Served it with crusty buns. This soup is a meal in itself, very filling and very delicious! thanks for posting Molly, we enjoyed it very much!...KittencalREVThis is wonderful!REVI must''ve tried 4 or 5 recipes trying to duplicate the Outback Aussie Cheese soup and FINALLY....your''s was the charm.  Absolutely love it..great taste, easy prep...couldn''t ask for more!REVOooooh YUM!  This is really delicious.  I am so glad to be able to satisfy the craving for the Outback soup in my own kitchen!  I followed the recipe exactly and was thrilled with the results!  Total happiness!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.REVThis soup was so good.  I''m not a fan of onions but i loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Will make again and againREVI was looking for something a little different and thought I''d give this a try as I actually had some velveeta cheese on hand. This was a smooth and delightful soup very cheesy. I used a sweet vidalia onion. Thanks Molly for a great addition to my soup cookbook .REVI''ve tried making this soup from another site, but I was very disappointed from how it turned out. I made it tonight and it''s already gone!! I also could not believe how impossibly easy it was to make!! My family LOVED it!!!!REVEveryone love the taste but I made it twice making the last time with less salt and I still got complaints on too salty. Any suguestions please?..my husband loves this soup.Thank you.REVMy son and I liked the soup, but it tasted somewhat different from Outback''s and we were looking for more of an exact match. It is quite good though.REVAfter finding about 3 different popular recipes for Outback''s delicious Creamy Onion Soup a.k.a. Walkabout Onion Soup, I decided to go with this one.  Am I''m glad I did!  I made this for my wife and me, and we both loved it.  Tastewise, it is pretty much identical, best I could tell and I''ve eaten this soup at Outback quite a bit.  Texturewise, it was slightly thinner, and slightly greasier  but not enough to make a difference.  I was more concerned with taste than texture, and in that regard, it exceeded expectations.Another note, I added a bit of sage, per comments from another review of another recipe by an exOutback employee.  I think this made a difference, and possibly made it more like the original.  I also added a third oz. of Velveeta.  Lastly, while the ingredients call for 2 tbsp. of butter, the instructions call for 3  I went with 3, which may have been why it was a tad greasier.Thanks, Molly, for the great recipe.  I''ll definitely be making this again, and for a bigger party!REVGreat soup! Don''t think I''ve ever had the Outback version, but we enjoyed this. I had to sub regular cheese for Velveeta since what we had in the fridge was hard and dry! But delicious nonetheless! I also left out all the salt since I thought it would be too much with the bouillon cubes. I subbed cubes with water for the broth. Also used skim milk since that''s all we keep around here! Edited to add Wow, guess I underestimated how much DH loved this soup...he just finished the leftovers and wanted me to make it again yesterday!REVThe first time I made this is was WAYYY too salty, and I didn''t add the salt due to previous reviews stating it was too salty.  This recipe is delicious and so close to outbacks besides the fact that outbacks was much creamier than this.  I used low sodium chicken brothsafeway brand''s has less sodium than Swanson''s low sodium, and a lower sodium chicken boullion that came in a packet..I can''t remember what it''s called it has the word herbal in it.  That didn''t make a too delicious flavor though so I added one chicken boullion cube without any water to match it.   I have made this recipe twice in the last week, it is delicious!  Everyone loves it and can''t have just one bowl.  For more than 3 full bowls, I recommend doubling the recipe.REVI made this for my parents when they came to visit and my dad, an onion soup afficianado said, It wasn''t bad. high praise I made one change out of necessity  I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth and I left out most of the salt.  I did double batch  but it wasn''t enough for everyone.  Next time I make this for more than two people I''ll have to quadruple the recipe.REVThis was an excellent recipe.   We thought it tasted the same as the original.  Based on several other reviews I did not add the salt to the soup or the white sauce and it was perfect.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!REVI was looking around for an Onion Soup recipe....and wound up with this one...Great find!  Wonderful recipe.REVThis soup is very close to Outbacks! They have not been serving it lately at the location closest to me so I decided to try myself. This recipe is quick, delicious, and EASY. Thank you!!!!!REVThis soup is wonderful, it was quick and easy to prepare and all my dinner guests enjoyed it. I served it with Beer Bread 73440 and it went wonderfully together. I made it just as written and I wouldn''t change a thingREVVery good onion soup. It was a pleasent change from the traditional onion soup. Will make this again.REVWow!  The Outback in my area stopped offering this on their menu   I was so bummed, as this was one of my absolute favorite soups.  Thank you so much for your submission of this recipe!!!  It was AWESOME!  I will be making this again and again.  The only thing I didn''t do was add salt.  I thought the bouillon would take care of that for me, and it did!  Thanks again for the post!!REVreally good soup.  read reviews before i made it so i used a little extra flour in the roux and cut back on the salt and the soup was perfect.  also gently rewarmed white sauce and melted cheese in it before adding to onionbroth mixture.REVThis is one of my MOST favorite soup recipes.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls and sometimes it comes out thicker than others, but it is ALWAYS so tasty.  This one will stay in my book forever!REVThis soup is delicious and tastes alot like the real thing.  My husband really loved it!  I doubled the recipe, but followed the ingredients exactly.  So yummy!  Thanks!REVMy favorite soup on the face of the planet! My Dad makes this for my family and we LOVE IT! I follow the recipe to the T and it comes out perfect every time. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the original from Outback. Honestly, I believe this recipe is more flavorful than the original. Thanks a million for the recipe! My life is now complete! REVThank you for this recipe, my family absolutely loved it!!  I ended up using thick shredded chedder as a sub for the velveeta and dropped in some caesar croutons at the end instead of the bread for the kids and it was a major hit!  I will make this for years to come... thanks! I must say this is one of the best soups I''ve ever madeREVLOVED IT!!!! I substituted the velveeta cheese with a slice of american cheese and a slice of swiss cheese... instead of whole milk I used evaporated milk, it made it sooooo creamy!I also used low sodium beef broth instead of chicken broth.I also skipped the bouillon cubes, didn''t feel the need for them. And I''m really glad I didn''t, it was perfect and creamy with out them. With these adjustments, It was not too salty at all!');

Served with cheese filled tortellini, toasted garlic bread and Italian bread. I did add some diced pepperoni to up the pizza flavour.  It was excellent, and my son just loved it. Thx Lainie!REVWe had so much fun with this!  We served it with cubes of focaccia bread and toasted raviolis.  I wanted something fun for the kids to introduce them to fondue and this was a great hit.  Thank you.REVThis was a delicious recipe!!!

Thanks for the idea! It turned out great!REVI don''t know why but this seemed a little bland to my husband and I.  We thought next time, we''ll add small diced pepperoni, and more mozzerella and less cheddar.REVThis was a great meal for my family.  My kids hovered over the fondue pot and were getting upset with whoever was dipping in because they were taking too much.  LOL  I will be making this again!  Thank you so much for a crowd pleaser!  I also didnt use fennel seeds because I didnt have any, and I wil remember next time to add it!REVInspired by this recipe, I created my own vegan version.  I used about 8 oz. of Smart Grounds ground beef alternative, about 12 cup leftover spaghetti sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, 10 oz. of Vegan Gourmet brand mozzarella cheese cubed, onion powder, garlic powder, basil, and oregano.  Since Smart Grounds are already cooked, I just plopped all the ingredients in the fondue pot, covered it with foil, and stirred frequently until the cheese melted.  It was absolutely delicious and my meateating husband agreed!  It was almost fatfree and 100 cholesterolfree and I don''t think anyone would guess it was vegan without knowing.  Thanks for posting this it''s a great springboard of a recipe!REVWe like to try new fondues.  And this one is amazing.  It tastes like pizza.  I didn''t use fennel seeds.  I used oregano and basil.REVI didn''t add any of the spices since I thought my pizza sauce was pretty good already forgot which recipe I used for it.  I only used mozzarella cheese, but it still came out very good.  The leftovers were just as tasty, although they didn''t look very nice.  I served this with breadsticks, thanks!REVI didn''t follow much on this recipe, but it inspired me to my own version. I took jar''d spagehtti sauce and put it in an electric fondue pot and dipped prepared meatballs thought meatballs would be more fun since we could use the dipping stick more often and garlic breadsticks in it. Very yummy and a big hit. Not sure how to rate this, since I didn''t use many of the ingredients, but wanted to give you the credit because if I wouldn''t have seen this recipe, I would have never thought to do a Italianpizza fondue. Thanks!!! REVMade it for my kids they loved it.  Had leftover so I took a pizza crust spread the rest over and baked in the oven.  Awesome.  I also added my seasonings to the hamburg and onion mix while it was cooking, just habit, taste comes out betterREVThis was a real fun meal for the kids. It was our first attempt at fondue with the kids and they loved every minute of it. I used Papa John''s Pizza Pizza Sauce 108447 for the sauce. I think next time I will leave out the fennel as it gave a different flavour to the sauce that I did not really like. I have added this recipe to my recipes to use ground beef mix because that is what I used for the ground beef.REVGood, basic recipe, but a little bland. Would suggest flavoring it with basil and oregano to start.REVMy 3 boys loved this. I had some plain bagels to cut up and dip.

Cut back on the oil, you just need enough to keep the peppers from sticking to the pan.  I guess I should have read the other reviews before making these, most of them mention these points.  If I make these again, with these changes, I will up date my review.REVI''ve made this a couple of times and my DH and I love them.   Some portobellos can be so thick they don''t get cooked all the way through,  so I found that if I grill them first about 23 minutes a side before stuffing them, they are cooked better. I add fresh chopped hot peppers from our garden to spice things up because that''s what we like.  We eat 2 each as a main meal with a salad and we''re completely satisfied.  I added fresh garlic but only after the mix is sauted.  The flavour of garlic comes through much stronger when it''s not cooked.  We LOVE garlic!  I also added salt  pepper.  This is a real nice and easy meal.REVThis is a lovely way to prepare those wonderful mushrooms.  A perfect substitution for those pizza cravings.  I use a melon baller to scrape out the gills from the mushrooms.  That is a neat and quick way to get rid of them, as they aren''t too pretty cooked.

I made this dish as you directed, but I did add one seeded, deveined jalapeno with the other peppers.  It wasn''t that noticible.  Maybe next time I will add some pepper flakes instead of the jalapeno.

Very attractive presentation and easy to pull off.REVThese are great!
I used mozzarella cheese and as I didnt have an orange pepper just left it out.
Will make again. Yum!REVThis is a GREAT way to satisfy the pizza craving without all the carbs but , PLEASE do yourself a favor .
Take a spoon and scrape out all the gills on the under side of the mushroom . This will help get rid of all that inky black juice that comes from cooking these mushrooms . I added a spoonful of pizza sauce to the top , then put on the vegs. , then broiled them until the cheese was melted . DELICIOUS !!!!

If you make this cake, you simply MUST make the frosting to go with it! For someone like me who normally scoops frosting OFF cakes, I was practically licking my plate! To make it though, was a bit daunting. On the first attempt, my frosting came out too lumpy. On the 2nd try, I revised it by adding the powdered cocoa and 12 c. water mixture into the buttery liquid first after step 16. Then with the remaining cornstarch, I scooped about 23 spoonfuls into a small seperate bowl and mixed it with the some of the simmering sauce from the stove. Stirred it til silky smooth and poured it back into the simmering pot to thicken it, mixing it once again. Repeat this several times, while keeping the bubbling mix on low heat and contantly stirring. I did have to add a bit of water from time to time to keep it from thickening too much, but I recommend you do so by instinct. The frosting should be almost like a pudding texture maybe a little thinner. When done, you''ll have to work quickly to frost the cake but your knife will just glide on the cake and the end result is just fabulous!

Recommended for all those who want a piece of alohalove!REVThis is the first time I''ve incorporated anything into beaten egg whites so this was new territory for me.  I thought the cake would be the difficult part, but it turned out lovely.  The tricky part as lemonlylime pointed out is the frosting.  I was in a hurry and tried to make it quickly and ended up with starch lumps.  I didn''t spend enough time mixing the cocoa, cornstarch and water together and kind of sloshed it in the bubbling pot while trying to stir with the other hand.  In a burst of inspiration I thought i could smooth out the lumps in my blender. Those of you who know better are probably falling off your chairs, but I was in a rush and desperate.  It didn''t work, so don''t try it.  After a few spins and sitting out for a spell it looked liked something I imagine you might find in a macbeth cauldron so it ended up in the trash.  I tried a second time and thoroughly mixed the cocoa, starch and water together and was a bit more coordinated when combining it with the bubbling solution in the pot.  It turned out better, but the were a few lumps.  You have to be careful about the how fast you let it come to a boil, I think.  I fathom it''s like making gravy, but I have never made gravy so this is only a guess. End result Positive.  I received the Hawaiian seal of approval from hubby... Trickier to execute than anticipated.  Next time I will try lemonlylime''s suggestions.REVPlease be advised. No cream and cornstarch doesn''t make the Dobash frosting from the good old days. look up Ganache frosting instead it''s closer to the rich frosting from back in the day.Lihia Baker''s and HECO''s recipes are the same disappointing result. Local girls are like Southern women in that a large part of our identities and self worth relate to our cooking skills. I was bragging about our local Dobash frosting and was embarrassed by this, HECO''s and Liliha Bakery''s recipes all falling short.

REVVery good and quick to put together.  I changed the serving size to just four.  My husband also added extra barbeque sauce when it was done cooking.  We made sandwiches with this as the final product seemed something like pulled pork.  Thank you for a great, easy recipe on a busy day.REVSuper easy  tastes great!  I think I enjoyed it more than DS did.  The pineapple really soaked up the BBQ flavor  was a little overpowering for him. I think DH will enjoy this when he gets home tonight.  My crock pot cooks hot  even on low with a reduced cook time 5 hours most of the strips were a little on the dry side.  I did have a few larger pieces from when I started slicing into rounds before remembering what I was supposed to be doing!  Next time I''ll cook even less time or put the pork in whole  shred it when it''s done.  Thanks for sharing, OzMan!

Instead it made it tough and rubbery.  I don039t know what to say about the marinade. None of the ingredients  complimented any of the other ones.

The best way I can think to describe the taste to someone who''s never tried it is as a Mexican take on barbecue sauce. And the wonderful thing about it is the level of spiciness is almost completely dependent on what salsa you use. Oh yeah, and I think the sauce goes REALLY well over rice, so much so that I almost thought the rice was better with the sauce that the pork itself was!

enough chili powder and the tomato juice was not a 
good enough substitution for stewed or diced tomatoes.

have stuck to my gunz!

I put about 2x the amount of lemon juice... we like things really lemmony.  I just reduced the amount of milk by a couple of tablespoons and it came out creamy and perfect.

I did not use the salt in the sauce either, the butter was salted.This would be a very good recipe for OAMC. You couldn''t make the sauce ahead though.If you didn''t want the patties as moist cut back on the milk.Thanks for posting.
Oh, I loved the cayenne pepper in the sauce. Just the perfect seasoning!REVThis was a recipe at the get go that I was not prepared for in terms of temperature outside vs. indoor airconditioning.  I made it  and had to turn on the oven. Maybe a bit hot, but I didn''t notice.   It turned out fantastically.  I would have liked maybe a little less moisture in the final product, but quite tasty.  Many people make mention of what they would do or had to succumb to doing..... me being one of those people.   I always have lemons at my disposal, for cooking, at this time, only limes....oh well.  My darling hubby says he would not have it any other way.  Not sure whether he means it, or just loves me for cooking for him.

I liked putting the patties in muffin cups, because as they baked I also baked rolls.REVI fixed this for dinner and they just loved it.  Said I could serve this up for them anytime.  I also added just a bit more lemon to the sauce, and it was so good.  I plan to try the remainder of the sauce over some fresh shrimp now, too.  Thanks for sharing this easy and good dish!REVA quick dish and it''s nice not having to stand over a hot stove, so ovenbaked got my attention here.  I did make a few changes....my family likes lots of flavor so I used one whole chopped onion and 3 TBLS Worcestershire. Turned out great!! Now for the yummy Lemon Sauce...not having any lemon juice in the house, I used 1 12 tsp lemon extract. The lemon and cayenne are a wonderful tasting duo! I caught myself tasting and retasting it!!  

I''ll be fixing this again. 
Thank you Sean!!REVYum! Only changes I made were using the zest of the lemon as well for a bit of extra zing and I quite like the bones and skin in in canned salmon so skipped removing them. It went wonderfully served with some salad.REVVery, very nice!  I did end up making quite a few changes in the recipe as I went along, but the end result was a very nice dinner.  I had some leftover fresh salmon, so flaked  used that.  I didn''t have any parsley that would''ve been a nice touch  next time I''ll make sure to have some on hand.  I decided to go with the White Worchester Sauce for no particular reason.   Halving the sauce recipe made plenty  I did double the lemon juice.  This was an easy, tasty meal which I will surely make again.  Thanks, Sean!REVGood going Sean, This is a wonderful change in the usual salmon patties.

But I got it levelled into the 13x9 pan, melted the chocolate and spread it over top, then let it sit at room temperature rather than in the fridge, because I didn''t want it to go too hard. I needn''t have bothered! This is as hard as a rock! With difficulty, I managed to crack a piece out with my chef''s knife nothing else would cut this.

You can make this as spicy as you dare, by altering the amount of cayenne.  The spicier the better for me, so I added a bit of Tabasco to the mix for good measure.  Also threw in a goodsized pinch of basil.

But, as a recipe for flapjack, I found it disappointing. FYI, I followed Babs'' recommendation to bake it for 45 minutes at 300 degrees, and Pat''s recommendation to use half golden syrup and half brown sugar, which might have made a difference. I think the ratio of oats to syrup is way off, because mine turned out more like a gooey candy with some oats in it.

Flattening down is easier if the spoon is damp.

REVThe 5050 syrup and sugar idea is a good one, but try using maple syrup and not just regular table or corn syrup for a delicous Canadian twist to a very traditional British classicREVWhen making flapjacks I have always used a 5050 syrup, sugar mix, heating the butter, sugar and syrup together before adding the oats.   This recipe, adding the sugar cold, makes preparation quicker no need to wait for all the sugar to melt.

The results look delicious too hot yet to taste!
 

Thanks for a quickie method.REVI used 5050 sugarsyrup. Because I like my flapjaks to be quite moist I also used a can of cherries in syrup, let a lot of the syrup drain of, spread a thin layer of flapjack mix into the baking tin, then a layer of cherries in syrup and covered it with the rest of the mix. They were absolutely delicious and non survived the day! I might use a little less sugar next time as it was quite sweet!');

I put tourniquets on it! ahahaha It worked!REVI love this recipe! I will make it again next year, but with red jello had orange already and a taller container. I used a rolling pin to get the worms out of the straws and it worked perfectly. Make sure to use a narrow and tall container!REVThis is a great recipe.The worms look real and they taste good too.I like to use the raspberry flavor jello.REVThey have a Halloween themed Birthday party for one of our officers every year.  Last year I made these along with the severed finger cookies.  They were a huge hit.... which means everyone was somewhat grossed out!!!  They are worth the effort!REVThese were a big hit at my ladies get together and fun to make!REVThese were great!  My kids were grossed out, but my daughter loved the taste!  My son wouldn''t try them  It took some time to get the worms out of the straws, but otherwise it was pretty easy.  It was a perfect addition to our halloween party this year!  Thanks.REVThese are fantastic!  I made a batch and served some in a bowl and also put some in a recipe 51813.  They were a huge hit.   The kids AND the adults all liked them!REVA HUGE hit with the kids in the neighborhood.  I made a batch this weekend to as a test for Halloween next month. They look so real no one really wanted to eat them.  I used raspberry gelatin and my worms have a nice, realistic pinkishbrown color.  I think it might be fun to make two batches and use grape gelatin for the second batch so there are some light and dark worms in the bowl.  Thank you so much for the GROSSEST recipe EVER!!!!!REVA lot of fun to make, they do look so real. Just a tip for the next person, make sure the flexible part of the straw is facing down in the carton. My son loved them.REVFun Fun Fun!   Very gross looking, but they tasted good.  I had some trouble at first getting them out of the straw but once I got the hang of it it worked out.  Thank you for sharing.REVThe best way to keep the jello in the straws is to fill them 14 of the way, put in freezer 20 minutes, then fill up the rest of the way.REVThe flexible straws give the worms realistic ridges and their color is perfect.REVThis was perfect and an enormous hit at the 5th grade Halloween party today! All the kids freaked out, and all the moms wanted the recipe. The only trouble I had was getting them out of the straws. I ran them under hot water for 4 seconds, but the water was too hot and turned the jello to goo, so I did 2 seconds on lukewarm water. My husband grabbed one end of the straw with pliers and used his thumb to press out the jello. The rolling pin did not work at all for us.REVThey turned out great and taste pretty good too. The only thing that I''ll do different next time is not use dollar store straws. They split at the ridge area on some of them.REVI have not even tried this, but it sounds so grossly wonderful! My granddaughter will LOVE this!brbrI wrote the above in 2006, now, exactly 4 years later I can update my review...wow, what fun! These worms look so real and taste so good! I did not have the jello called for, but I don''t think it matters. I used what I had. They were both red jellos and both were sugar free. I added blue food coloring to the jello mix to make it more purple, then I added enough green to the whipping cream to balance the color. I tried the rolling pin method, but the worms were too uniform when they came out. I also found it a bit awkward. The finger method worked best for me, until I remembered that I had a small surgical clamp. I clamped it onto the end, which left both fingers free to squeeze out the worm and direct it into the bowl. I am excited to see my goblins tomorrow night! Thanks again for this wonderful share!REVFun! Fun! Fun! It was well worth the work.  My only disappointment was the amount of waste involved.  All of the worms stuck together in the bowl after being loosened from the straws so I think next time I will spray them all with a little nonstick spray.  Definitely a keeper for the shock value!REVI''ve been making these for years they originally came from Sunset magazine. A friend helps me get them out of the straws because I now have problems with my hands. He''s a very adventurous eater and knows exactly what''s in them, but he is freaked out by how realistic they are and won''t even try one. We serve them as part of Mud, Dirt and Worms every HalloweenI layer chocolate pudding with lots of oreo crumbs in a plastic flower pot used only for this recipe, then chill for several hours and garnish with the worms.REVI was really excited to make this recipe for my son''s 2nd grade class.  It was a flop and I had to go to a backup plan.  The JellO mixture wouldn''t stay in the straws even after I tried foil and a bag rubberbanded to the straws.  Then I tried cooling the mixture a little more...only to find it sat on TOP of the straws! I ended up just leaving it in the bowl and calling it chopped liver.brbrHow in the world did you all manage to keep the JellO in the straws????? Not going to try again until someone reveals their secret!REVHow do you keep the liquid inside the straws.  There is no way they fill up, everything goes out from the bottom.  Please tell me what I should do to be able to fill the straws.  thank you.REVWhy is the whip cream needed in the recipe?REVThese worked out perfectly! I followed the directions but used strawberry jello. My biggest tip is to purchase the tall whipping cream container so you will have a snug fit around your straws. I used a cup but I had alot of waste around the worms still edible which made my straws fill up 34 of the way. I saw people asking how to get it to stay in the straws, it''s a tall snug container that does it.REVThese are the coolest, grossest things I''ve ever made!  They look great, and feel disgustingly real.  My 4 yr old boy loved dangling them over his mouth and slurping them down, my 6 yr old girl took about 10 minutes working up the nerve to try one.  Even when told they were jello, some people wouldnt try them!  My kids took them to school today, and were the hit of their classes!REVAmazing, they really look like worms! Kinda gross! But really neat!I didn''t have whipping cream so I substituted cool whip with a little powdered sugar to thicken the cool whip. They still turned out! I also put a little crushed up graham cracker to look like dirt.Thanks for the brilliant idea! Note It is best to hold straws underwater for only about 4 seconds. This allows the worms come out smoothly yet they are not turning into mush from too much heat!REVSo sorry that I forgot to review this.  We used this almost 2 years ago! for my daughter''s sweet 16 party where we played Fear Factor games.  These really looked real.  We did have a bit of trouble with the first few, but then we found that holding the end of the straw with needlenosed pliers helped a lot.  Also, be sure to run the worms under hot water long enough.  We were afraid that they would melt, but found that if you do it correctly, they will remove with ease and have a glossy appearance to them.Thanks for a great grossout recipe.REVI made these for my daughter''s halloween party and they were a hit! My bowl full of worms was the star of the table and they were eaten up quickly! The kids and adults loved them. It was a little time consuming, but worth the effort.REVooooh wee! these were a hit at my son''s halloween party. I used a box of green lime and orange, did everything else the same and they were a GREAT green color. I pushed in about 20 more straws and 2 days later pushed all those suckers out with my fingers  that was hard work! LOL About 20 straws after I started I remember I was to rinse them and that made the job much less messy.  They will be at the party next year too! Thanks!REVWhat a cool idea!  I love it.  Until it came time to get the worms out of the straws.  Way too time consuming.  I ran out of time and gave up. They look just like real worms though.  May try again next year and start early just because it is so gross  I mean cool!  REVIt was great, I loved it!REVI loved this recipe. I took it to my daughter''s Halloween party, and it was well enjoyed. The kids says it tastes like jello with whipped cream.REVThese were a lot of work, but they were GREAT! My son had a Halloween themed birthday party and they were a HUGE hit. We brought them around on a platter and the looks on people''s faces were priceless!REVThis awesome! I made some for an adult party and they had a blast with them. I then made another batch and grossed out the local kids with themREVSoooo gross!  I love it!  A friend and I made these for her Halloween party.  If you do not THOROUGHLY cool them, they will be twotoned.  Takes some time to make, but worth it.  Very high grossout factor!    Thanx for shring!REVThese look so gross but taste so yummy and are such a great idea!!
Thanks for sharing Linda! REVI brought this to work on Halloween. Great recipe. Really easy!!!  REVI think I may have messed up the recipe, I didn''t add the whipping cream.  It tasted good but was tons of work.  I probably won''t make it again, nice idea though.REVThese were fun for a teenage Halloween party we had this past weekend.  The kids thought they were so cool when they grabbed a few at a time and let them dangle from their black painted, vampire teeth filled, fake blood dripping down their chin, mouths.  They were fun.  I did have a little bit of a problem getting them out of the straws, but not enough that some patience and care didn''t resolve the issue of removing them.  Thanks for a fun recipe for our party.REVTotally awesome!  Tough to get out of the straws, but definitely worth the effort!  Great effect, great taste!REVOMG! These were so disgusting. I hate worms so I could not bear to try more than half of one before I grossed myself out. LOL  My adughter 7 would not even venture to try them and my son 7 loved them! Flavor was awesome.  Just a really creepy gag treat. All the kids either said cool or gross. What a hit!REVThis was a really easy recipe.  To get all the worms out quickly, I put the ends of two straws between my teeth and pushed with my fingers.  This made the process go by much quicker.  
Also, instead of laying them out separately to finish setting up, I piled them all in a bowl to set up together and this formed a brain.  It was quite a hit!REVMy daughter and I had great time making these.  They came out a bit darker because in australia our packaging is different and it was hard to get correct conversions.  The kids loved them.REVI found a fast and easy way to get the worms out of the straws using needlenose pliers. First I tried squeezing the open end of the straw with the pliers but it was too slippery. Then I tried grabbing the straw with one nose of the pliers inside the straw and the other nose outside. That did the trick. With my new solid grip I was able to squeeze the worms out quickly and easily...they practically slid out! It should only take you a few seconds for each straw. The worms really complemented my Qwiggle Halloween Jello molds I have the hand, brain and eyeballs. Check out Qwiggle Jello molds online, they look so real it''s scary. I love my gruesome but tasty treats for Halloween!REVGreat idea, I was so excited but they did not work for me. My worms were only about 1 inch long, all the jello snuck out the bottom of the straws. How did you all make them, that the jello didn''t sneek out??REVThis has to be a five star recipe simply due to the special affects.  Taste is okay.  Kids love how they look.  They even feel like real worms.  It is really time consuming getting the worms out of the straws, but worth it to see the kids faces.REVWhat fun!  I agree they''re a bit messy to make but hey, Halloween comes but once a year.  My 72yearold husband walked by and said YUK!  they look like sea worms and I''m not having any, the other kids in the house howled when they saw them.  Taste isn''t bad, either.  TFS!REVI thought these were fantastic.   My husband thinks I''m crazy.  I made them for girls preschool halloween party.  One classroom gobbled them up.  Only 2 kids from the other class would eat them.  I think it might have been the presentation.  They really looked like actual worms.   I used a square milk carton and got about 250 worms.  They were 3 to 4 long each.  Next time I think I''m going to put a layer of paper towel in the bottom of the carton to try and decrease the excess flow from the bottom of the straws.    As another reviewer suggested I crushed up chocolate teddy grahams for dirt and mixed it with the worms in little bowls.    Thanks!REVAdditional tips  a one liter plastic drink container with the top cut off works great.  Make sure you put the straws in the container upside down.  Allow enough time to squirt the worms out of the straws and ask for help!  Otherwise this is a VERY COOL affectparents are grossed out and the kids think it is cool!REVThese were great  they looked very real!  I wasn''t crazy about the flavor, but I might try different flavors of jello next time and compensate with food coloring.  The effect was more important anyway.  I served the worms in a glass serving dish mixed with crushed chocolate graham crackers and crushed oreos for dirt.  Awesome!REVThese were the biggest hit! I made them for my kids Halloween sleepover, but me, hubby, and hubby''s friend were eating them before the worms were even set out! oD  I thought they were well worth the time to make them.  I used a tall, round straw holder to set the straws in to fill with the Jello mixture, PERFECT!  
MMMSweets...I thought yours were intentional when I saw your picture.  My first thought was Cool,  someone made maggots instead of worms.  I have to add that one with the worms next year!  So thanks to you I have another dish to set out next Halloween! lolREVThese were great! I saw that someone else had a problem with the liquid running out of the end of the straw.. I had this problem too, but the container I used was too big.. I wound up dumping it all into the original container and trying again with something that was tall and lean, so the straws were snug in the container. So if your container is too big, it runs right back out.. There was definitely jello on the insides of that container, but it also stayed in the straws..  I thought had plenty of raspberry jello, but only had 1 container, so I used a blue berry to go with.. By the time I got the green food coloring mixed in, my worms were grey.. Which was still ok.. They were a big hit! Thanks!REVThese really did look real! The 24 year olds would not touch them, but my 7 and 9 year old loved eating them! Make sure to fill up bending straws with the flexible side down. You want the ridges in the worms. Takes quite a bit of time getting all of the worms out3040 minutes. This was a small portion for a big party next time I''ll make two hundred!');

Tony UKREVI doubled the recipe and used chicken thighs. Not having an chili paste, I used chili powder. I loved it! It was so very easy and forgiving. This recipe definitely has to be served with some kind of palate cleanser though. Either that or have ice cream for desert. REVI thought this was wonderful! I only cooked 1 chicken breast  cut the sauce into 14 as well. I used more apple juice for the wine  switched the coriandercurry amts to get more of a curry flavor. I marinated it for about an hour in the fridge reserved half the sauce for serving  cooked it on the skillet. Next time I''m going to try to cover  simmer it with the sauce on low, and also have more sauce on the side for dipping. It was tangy with a nice heat from the chili paste. Thank u for sharing this!REVWe had this tonight, and I used bonein thigh pieces then skinned them, and I used an inch piece of ginger, and I thought it was a very large amount of chill knowing my current batch so I cut it back to a level teaspoon. I garnished the dish with fresh coriander too. Wonderful dish if you enjoy curry like we do.REVI didn''t have any chili paste so I used thai red curry paste.  It came out pretty good I thought, even though other people felt it was a tad too spicy and maybe bland. I would think that the marinating time could be increased to fix that.  Oh well, at least I liked it a lot.  Thanks!REVI really like this dish, although I find it quite bland. I added 1 tsp of salt before the addition of honey. And I also added 2 tsp chilli paste. I sauteed the onions and garlic and browned the marinated chicken before adding the reserved marinade to the skillet. Nice and spicy  it''s great over white basmati rice.REVI cut down on the chilli just a little and added fish sauce instead of the paste. Also used low fat evaporated milk with a few drops of coconut essence instead of coconut milk. Really enjoyable. Will be keeping this recipe.REVWe liked this very much, but found the chicken was little dry, next time I would cut the breasts into smaller strips. Loved the lemony flavour and thought there was just the right amount of curry and heat from the chili paste. The honey was a nice touch. Thanks for posting.?  Jun 28, 2006

This one is a keeper, thanks for sharing Doreen.REVI haven''t tried this recipe yet, but I am very familiar with schnitzel, having lived in Germany for 9 years.  Rather than use veal in this recipe I suggest using boneless pork, which is what is used by the German restaurants I''ve eaten at here in the US use.

It is a very lean tough piece of meat and this marinade vastly improved the flavor and the tenderness. I cooked the steaks on the charcoal grill and they were very tasty. REVQuick, easy and so good! We have only used this recipe for our steaks since finding it on this website! REVI loved it!  You have to adjust the ingredients a bit though.  I recommend reducing the olive oil by half, doubling the balsamic vinegar and leaving it wet don''t pat dry when you put it on the grill.  Also, don''t discard the garlic as it adds a great aroma and taste to the meat while it cooks.  This marinade is good for one pound of steak only, you will need to make more for larger portions of meat.  Marinade for a minimum of one hour for each inch of thickness.  I know the receipe says that the balsamic vinegar doesn''t have to be expensive but make sure it''s strong or you will be left with a steak that has a great aroma with little flavor.  Again, I love it and highly recommend it to those individuals who like their steaks with a little flair.   REVMade the marinade as written but cut my steaks into cubes for kabobs. I let the cubes of steak marinade for about an hour. The skewered steak cooked quickly on the grill. We thought the flavor was very good, slightly tangy and spicy. Even my 2 year old liked it. Thanks for the keeper recipe!REVI tried this recipe for my steak dinner and I am sorry we did not like this at all.....I followed what another reviewer said...and I apologize but we could not even eat this...we had to through it out...I could have done something wrong but maybe balsamic vinegar is not for us...as it was our first time trying anything specifically with Balsamic vinegarREVThis was pretty good. I made it per original instructions, but I will follow the changes another reviewer made to increase the vinegar and decrease oil next time. It was a great quick marinade with staples most people have at all times.REVBalsamic Vinegar''s purpose is to aid in penetration into the meat with whatever spice garlic, salt, pepper, Chicago Rub or spice abcxyz of your choice.

I used Mounds instead of Almond Joy, omitted the sliced almonds and used the whole can 14 oz of condensed milk.  These took 30 minutes to bake in my oven.  I may never make plain brownies again!  Thanks for the simple, yet indulgent, recipe!!!!REVI wasn''t sure about the directions because my brownie mix called for 12 cup oil, so I ended up using a couple of T more oil. I think that made them a little too gooey. I made these as part of a brownie platter and honestly they were not my favorite but they were quite good. They were so easy to make and I am sure that had I made them alone they would have not had to struggle to get my favor. I think I will try making them again using DC brownie mix and see what happens. Bt the way, these also freeze quite well.REVThese brownies are for all almond joy fans.  They are very rich, gooey, and delicious.  I love the way the candy bars melt right into the brownie.  If I was to do anything different, I might try cutting down on the sweetened condensed milk a little.  Thanks for sharing a yummy recipe.REVThis was an easy recipe to make.  I made two batches for a bake sale.  It was one of the first things to sell out!  I asked a couple of people who bought the brownies what they would rate them between 1 and 5 and they both said 4.  I added the extra star for ease of preparation.  I couldn''t find 14 ounce packages of Almond Joy Bars, so I just used the 11.9 ounce packages.

 mix some sweetened  condensed milk with natural unproccesed coconut, mini chocolate chips and toasted almonds, evenly sprinkle over brownie batter then pour over remaining sweetened condensed milk.

Great flavor and they stay moist for daysnot that they lasted very long  Thanks so much!REVI baked 3 types of brownies for a family gathering. All were yummy but people gravitated towards the almond joy fudge brownies first. Who could resist a fudgey coconut topping with almonds? Thanks!REVThis was an easy recipe to prepare.  The result was a very sticky, gooey, sweet treat.  By the way, 1 can of condensed milk equals 1 cup. I made a second time , heating the condensed milk in the microwave to help it spread more evenly and I used shredded, sweetened coconut instead of the almond joys.  I did everything else the same, except bake in a 15 x 10 pan for 25 minutes.  I drizzled some milk chocolate over the top.  I think that the original recipe has the better taste, because you just can''t duplicate the Almond Joy''s, but heating the milk definitly helped the second batch, as did the larger pan.  Thanks for the unusal take on plain old brownies.REVSuper delicious!! This is a recipe I will use often!! REVThis was soooo good!  Even my hubby said it was a definite 5  recipe!  LOL  We really enjoyed it, although I had no toasted almonds, so I didnt use any, but it was wonderful!  Thanks for a great dessert!REVOh Miss Annie, how could I resist.

So easy and so rich and chewy. My guests even asked if they could take some home with them. Not much left hope I get to them before the kids do! Great recipe. You''ve done it again! REVThese were so good.  I love coconut and these just hit the spot.  I made them for a Navy Wives Social and everyone who had one said they were good.

  I loved it too, because it was so easy to make and serve.  It is a definite keeper.
  I did oven fry my chicken breasts coated with a little lowfat mayo and then dipped in the Italian bread crumbs.  I think it probably cut down on the fat content quite a bit.  That is important for us senior citizens.

Thanks for the recipe!!REVCooked this last Tuesday and husband said it was in his Top 5!!! Thanks for the awesome recipe!REVAs a quick recipe for chicken parmesan, I think it was pretty good.  It was easy and tasty.  The most critical ingredient is the tomato sauce.  I used Barilla Marinara which is what I had on hand which had chunks of tomatoes in the sauce.  I preferred putting it under the broiler for a few moments to brown the cheese slightly and make it bubbly.  I would probably make it again  I have added a photo of my dish.REVI really like the chicken breasts prepared this way and followed the instructions to the letter with the exception of the marinara sauce.  Instead, I made the lowfat alfredo sauce  292890.  I also put it under the broiler for a few moments, this was delicious and thaks Marg for the recipe.REVSimple and tasty!REVThis is so simple  tasty.  Truthfully,  I don''t know why, but this is the 1st time I have ever made Chicken Parm.  I did add some sliced mushrooms  onions sauteed  then shoveled it all in the oven 350 x25 min  then turned the heat up to 385 x15 min when I added the fresh mozz.  It was sooo good  the chicken was soo tender.  Served wspaghetti, fresh green beans  garlic bread sticks.  Thank you for sharing.REVEasy and delicious!!  I used linguine instead of the angel hair pasta, and I used freshly shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Marg for posting this recipe.REVI love this recipe!REVEasy and super good it probably was extra good because I used butter!  I think the taste of the dish depends on your spaghetti sauce.

We did enjoy it, the only noodles I had in were glass noodles but they worked fine, next time I''ll get the proper angel hair noodles. Will be making this again, thanks sooo much for sharing!!REVThis was fab. It would be a great dinner party dish for an informal night with friends because it has a great presentation and if you get the ingredients laid out beforehand it comes together in a flash. I made a few changes to reflect what I had on hand, but I don''t think they affected the dish significantly. I marinated the chicken in a bit of lemon juice, salt and pepper for about 20 minutes. I also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and lightly sauteed spring onions instead of parsley on top. For the breadcrumbs, I made my own using fresh bread, whizzed in a food processor and toasted in the oven. I think the total dish as written here would make quite a lot, maybe enough for 58 people depending if you serve with a salad and bread or not. I only had 1 chicken breast admittedly it was a big one  250g and used 5oz pasta and that was plenty for 2, with pasta left over.REVThis was really good.  Probably would have been even better if I had remembered to pound the chicken first as the recipe said.  Great as leftovers also.REVThis is a great recipe Marg, thanks for sharing. I used roast vegetable pasta sauce and fresh buffalo mozzarella rather than the  kind you can shred, so I just cut it into small chunks and added it while the chicken was still in the pan so that it would melt a little. It was delicious.REVMade this for supper last night, dh loved it !! So this will be a keeper

Had to juggle ingredients a bit as I only used 2 chicken breast.  That did not matter a bit though.  This was wonderful stuff.  My hubby usually makes chicken parmesean in the oven, and he was shocked that I was not baking it.  I did this and had dinner on the table in about 30 minutes.  Thanks Marg for another great recipe.REVThis quick and delicious!!!  My hubby loved it and we will be making this many times in my house.Thanks!!!REVExcellent!!!  I will definitely make this again.

My husband and sons absolutely loved this. Thanks!REVA loud YUM is the reaction I got from my 5 year old.....This recipe was good...thank you....fast and easy tasty and juicy....!!!REVmmmm Delicious!! I used freshly shredded parmesan and dry breadcrumbs, but not the fine one, next time I will use fine dry breadcrumbs, I''m sure they will stick better. Instead of the butter I used plain yoghurt, trying to save calories baked the full 25 minutes. Loved the flavours of the seasonings in the coating. DH loved it and asked for it again.  Thanks for posting!!REVVery good recipe. Lots of flavor without lots of work. The breasts were nice and juicy. I served them with some pasta with olive oil and parmesan and steamed vegetables.REVMy family loved this recipe.  I didn''t change a thing.REVInstead of all the seasonings, I used dried Italian Dressing mix.  It was phenominal.  My DH and FIL kept asking how I made it.  It was very easy and I will tuck this one away to make again!REVAnother great chicken recipe for us. Very easy to make and goes well with either vegetables or a salad. A ''keeper'' for us REVThis is one of my favorite baked breast recipes, and I use it often when I want more than just plain ole baked chicken.  It''s simple.  It''s delicious, and can be served with or without another topping, such as cheese slices or tomato sauce, or alfredo sauce.  It''s great on it''s own with whatever sides you want to put with it.

DEEPREVServed these with a red pepper pasta and side salad.  I used 4 chicken breasts and seasoned cornflake crumbs for the breadcrumbs.  The remaining ingredients stayed the same.  Added Italian seasoning to the cheesecrumb mixture instead of the oregano and parsley.  Followed WaterMelon and ''crumbed'' the chicken in advance, chilled it for several hours and then baked them on a parchmentlined baking sheet.  I did increase the temperature to 425 degrees and they browned nicely.REVthis is ohsogood! I scaled down to 2 servings, using 2 chicken breast halves, however I kept the crumb mixture at 4 servings. The amount is just perfect. I used freshly grated Parmesan and added 1 tsp garlic powder to the herb mixture. I served this with shell pasta and homemade tomato sauce. Thanks for the fantastic recipe, Marg! Edited to add  I ''crumbed'' the chicken in advance, chilled it on the parchmentlined baking tray for several hours that way the crumbs adhere better.REVVery easy and great flavor.  I did use Progresso Italian bread crumbs.  May turn half way through next time as the bottom was crispier than the top.  Served with Recipe 225125 and dessert Recipe 216350.REVMy extremely picky grandson loves this chicken. I''ve made it many times now. It''s relatively easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand...a keeper!');

If you blend the cranberries like I did, be forewarned that the cranberry flavour pretty much disappears the coconut flavour and texture becomes predominant.REVBeautiful and tasty muffins! I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding dry cranberries instead of fresh. I would suggest chopping the cranberries up first. The coconut adds just enough sweetness to offset the tartness of the cranberry. I will definitely make these again!REVI thought the muffins were great using the proportions as listed.  I usually like to adjust something but couldn''t find anything wrong with them.  The texture was moist and fluffy.  I did add nuts for more nutrition and texture which turned out well.REVI had some extra cranberries and coconut, and was on a muffinbaking binge.  The result was the discovery and prompt making of this recipe.  A slightly strange sounding combo that turned out pretty well.  The texture of the coconut was a great counterpoint against the tart cranberries.  In fact, that was the only downside to the muffins, is that the cranberries were just a little too on the tart side.  I may increase sugar, or actually roll them in sugar before making again... but I will make these again!    ');

I loved it so much, I''m planning to make a batch of small loaves just to give away for Christmas! Thanks!REVExcellent bread. Easy to make. No substitutions needed. If you are running low on fresh cranberries it comes out well with a combination of fresh and dried berries but the fresh are best, as they give it such a tang. I also once made it with hazelnuts instead of walnuts very good. To make for a lactose intolerant friend I substituted canola oil for the butter. When fresh cranberries are no longer available, I enjoy this bread yearround with fresh blueberries or frozen cherries.REVVery tasty!  I subbed 14 c wheat germ for 14 c of the flour and used sliced almonds instead of the walnuts.REVThis was delicious!  Smelled wonderful too!REVIt was very tasty despite the fact that I slightly overcooked it. I omitted the nuts. The prep took me longer than 15 minutes because halving cranberries is not my forte. It was worth the extra time though.REVShared this bread with coworkers and got two immediate requests for the recipe.  It is filled with healthyforyou stuff and little butter. The tartness of the cranberries adds great flavor.  I added a sprinkling of sparkling sugar to the top before baking.  Simply sublime!REVBoo, nut haters!  The walnuts in here make this loaf awesome.  I only had 1 c. of fresh cranberries, so instead I microwaved 34 c. dried ones with 2 Tbsp. brandy  water to cover for 1 min.  I also added 1 Tbsp. orange zest, which went well.REVI was going to post my recipe for cranberry bread until I saw this one it is the same, except mine has orange zest in it as another reviewer added. I make it to give away to other teachers at the school where I work. It is always a big hit. My one year old baby LOVES this bread.
